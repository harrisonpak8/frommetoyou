Arinton - Carts

- Generated 2000 items put in random users' carts
- Added a form to delete an item completely from a user's cart when given the uid, pid, sid and a separate form to  update the number of items in the user's cart if they input the uid, pid, sid, quantity (to change original quantity to)

Example: 1. search for user with uid = 1 in the Carts page
2. delete uid = 1, pid = 969, sid = 1996
3. search for uid = 1 again to see that item has been deleted
4. update the quantity for uid = 1, pid = 20, sid = 1438, quantity = 20
5. search for uid = 1 again to see that item's quantity is now 20
