4,4, Yeah interesting point. Nice chat,1/3/1971 10:57
4,4, Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.,7/8/2008 22:57
4,4, i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life,1/26/1970 4:09
4,350, Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex.,11/8/2018 22:55
4,4," thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced",7/15/1985 11:30

4,350, Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!,1/15/2022 12:04
4,4, thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!,9/20/1983 21:46
5,5, Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,9/15/1992 7:27
5,1638, i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?,7/22/1973 4:59
5,1638, That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.,12/20/1991 7:39
5,5, i guess they live up to their name then!,4/6/2016 10:35
5,1638, It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.,12/29/2008 0:33
5,1638, thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? ,9/3/1999 17:12
5,1638, Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.,10/1/1996 18:08
5,5, seems like fresh water fish got the short end of the stick with that one. Have you ever been to a cat cafe?,4/9/2021 14:54
5,1638," I have never been to a cat cafe no, what about you? Seems like they are popular in Japan and Taiwan.",9/6/2013 9:05

6,6, Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn't realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice.,11/5/2013 3:58
6,1515, i guess thats where the phrase cat nap comes from,7/27/2004 5:05

6,1515, Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?,3/20/2022 22:34
6,6," I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!",7/5/2008 8:59
6,1515, Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.,12/5/1977 9:51
6,1515, I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!,11/26/2011 19:44
7,7, Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?,11/1/2014 20:11
7,1954," Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.",12/2/1997 14:40
7,1954, Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper. ,11/29/1980 15:32
7,7," He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.",1/14/2000 13:02
7,1954, I didn't know this thanks for sharing.,1/28/1983 19:40
7,1954, Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes?,12/30/1997 9:08
7,1954, No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind.,7/2/1994 3:13
7,7, There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves.,6/27/2004 21:49
7,7, Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it.,2/3/1978 10:08
7,7, Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.,9/30/2011 12:35
8,8, I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.,8/30/1985 12:04
8,8, That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.,1/26/2018 5:09
8,8, No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.,5/24/2010 6:38
8,8," It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.",6/27/1998 6:11
8,8, Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye,3/6/1981 0:21

9,1982, Yes he was in the nutcracker as the mouse king,8/10/1992 8:35
9,1982, Yeah. DO you like SHakespeare?,10/18/1974 11:12
9,1982, I love his work. Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day?,3/4/2004 15:58
9,1982," Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such",5/16/2022 11:14
9,1982, Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did,8/23/2008 17:30
10,1575, I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.,1/17/1976 0:39
10,10, Yeah good point. He also invented some women's names,8/21/2017 5:55

10,1575," hi, do you use google much?",11/18/2010 21:34
10,10," Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?",9/8/1996 18:11
10,10, Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon,6/19/1994 6:39
11,1850, And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!,9/26/1980 13:37
11,1850, do you know how google maps calculates traffic?,7/20/2009 3:38
11,1850," I am not sure, how do they do this?",5/13/2013 23:11
11,11, they track how fast android devices are moving,3/3/2014 3:05
11,11, Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.,3/11/1996 13:51
11,11, Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years,9/5/1978 10:40
11,1850, But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?,1/20/2019 3:24
11,1850, No I have. What does the results turn?,4/7/1991 11:21
11,1850, You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?,6/18/2010 10:41
11,11," Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though",6/16/2001 21:09
12,662," Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun.",12/14/1978 1:40
12,662, I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield,4/9/1989 13:26
12,12," Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.",1/1/2000 18:58
12,12, Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them,9/4/1970 8:29
12,12, That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.,1/4/1984 10:56
12,12, wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat,7/12/2020 17:56
12,662," That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.",5/8/1995 19:40
12,12, They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.,5/17/2016 13:25
12,662, Do you like comic books?,1/10/2013 15:48
12,12, I do like comic books!,3/7/2019 7:54
13,13, Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?,7/12/1997 20:07
13,162, I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with excelsior!,1/3/1971 13:42
13,162, I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?,3/7/1987 15:56
13,13, I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.,8/20/2020 11:31
13,13, I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too. ,7/2/2010 21:30
13,162, The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!,6/24/2012 16:34
13,162, That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?,4/25/1979 11:09
13,13," I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!",4/21/1992 1:20
13,13," That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. ",1/7/2013 12:13
13,162," I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!",5/2/1994 17:40
14,14," That's pretty wild. Marvel published a generic comic book, in order to trademark the names superhero and super-villain. That was pretty smart of them. ",12/9/1991 7:29
14,1383, No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?,3/21/1991 9:37
14,14, I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt. ,10/16/2002 2:37
14,1383, That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.,6/28/1994 0:04
14,14, That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. ,5/9/2006 23:35
14,14, It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!,3/15/2004 9:51
14,1383, I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!,7/21/1979 5:01
14,14, Hahah That's a good way of putting it! ,8/14/1999 0:33
14,1383," Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!",3/6/2017 15:46
14,1383, Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse. ,8/30/1998 11:01
15,15, Its amazing and ever evolving. ,7/2/1999 10:59
15,1770, Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away. ,4/15/1975 3:40
15,1770, They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see,10/20/1982 9:50
15,1770," Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. ",12/27/1970 8:44
15,15, I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure. ,2/10/1996 1:14
15,1770," Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...",8/11/1983 11:30
15,15, There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron? ,5/23/2012 5:13
15,15," Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  ",12/13/2005 2:49
15,1770, It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.,7/24/1983 14:42
15,1770, Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?,10/16/2019 11:37
16,16," I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.",6/23/2004 17:20
16,1734," Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. ",9/27/1985 2:36
16,16," I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. ",12/8/2004 2:46
16,16, Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.,3/27/2018 10:10
16,16, On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.,7/5/1978 19:00
16,1734," I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. ",3/29/1991 3:30
16,16," Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. ",8/16/1978 23:22
16,16," Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  ",1/26/2010 20:55
16,1734," Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. ",6/13/1980 22:56
16,16," I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ",8/11/1990 3:09
17,17, Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on.,3/20/2020 18:50
17,17," Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!",9/6/2018 1:05
17,653," Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.",6/20/1996 4:25
17,653," Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.",8/4/1977 14:20
17,17, $7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.,2/9/1970 2:41
17,17," Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!",10/28/2010 20:36
17,17, A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.,1/21/1971 23:54
17,17," Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!",9/12/1979 23:32
17,17," I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.",1/31/1974 1:18
17,653, Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!,11/7/1973 5:47
18,18, I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!,4/24/2010 23:08
18,18, I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!,8/14/1999 23:17
18,60, I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.,5/31/1999 11:26
18,60," That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. ",3/13/1986 20:58
18,60," I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. ",10/27/1987 12:40
18,18," Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!",5/29/1984 12:33
18,18," Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.",8/10/1988 13:20
18,60," Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!",2/25/2011 20:53
18,18," I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.",6/13/1979 21:30
18,60," Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!",10/10/1991 19:45
19,1722," Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.",4/1/2016 16:26
19,1722," Naming a cloned cat copy cat, that's cute.",12/19/1970 12:18
19,1722, You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.,3/17/2012 10:06
19,1722, Really? That's awful to hear!,1/10/2019 5:52
19,1722, Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!,11/18/2015 11:04
19,19," Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.",12/7/2017 22:01
19,1722, And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets OWNER in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  ,6/13/1980 6:59
19,1722, I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.,1/3/2020 13:55
19,1722, Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?,10/29/2007 0:40
19,1722, That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.,1/20/2004 17:06
20,725," Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.",7/14/1982 12:43
20,20, I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.,3/27/1985 8:52
20,725," Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?",12/15/1980 18:00
20,725," Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.",7/29/1998 3:14
20,725, Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.,6/24/1998 15:20
20,20," Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.",9/5/2013 11:20
20,20," Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.",11/23/1984 23:07
20,725," Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.",10/31/1976 21:48
20,725," Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?",11/20/1976 6:09
20,20, I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!,1/9/2020 6:16
21,1669, That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!,1/15/1989 19:07
21,1669, Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.,4/27/2010 7:00
21,1669, I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?,1/24/2008 0:41
21,21," That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.",6/2/1990 18:13
21,21," Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog",6/20/2007 10:08
21,1669, Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.,1/3/2012 5:12
21,1669," Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.",2/16/2009 20:15
21,21, Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...,8/23/2002 9:12
21,21, Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.,2/7/1996 6:33
21,1669, That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.,2/28/1997 5:21
22,22," Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.",10/29/1975 20:48
22,728," Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.",12/18/2006 9:00
22,728, One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?,2/13/1990 6:00
22,22, Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.,3/5/2011 21:44
22,728, Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!,12/26/2019 17:53
22,728, It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.,7/6/1990 23:09
22,728, I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.,9/22/1996 10:04
22,22, That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.,12/14/1984 18:14
22,22," Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future.",12/7/2012 20:28
22,22, Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.,2/4/1999 13:57
23,716, Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.,2/29/2008 2:29
23,23," Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.",5/11/1995 11:11
23,23," I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.",7/27/1977 12:15
23,716, Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on. ,11/25/1978 0:29
23,23, Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.  ,2/26/1983 10:30
23,716," That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!",2/24/1984 13:48
23,716," Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish.",2/10/2017 2:54
23,716," Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15.",8/30/2021 1:00
23,716, Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real teddy bear along with a hyena,7/29/2001 19:15
23,716, Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.,1/16/1971 2:53
24,1216," I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian.",8/20/2011 11:51
24,1216," Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",7/4/2010 7:13
24,1216, The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions,11/22/1989 9:06
24,24, That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,12/28/2009 19:58
24,1216, Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members,1/23/1974 5:02
24,24," That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy",5/30/1992 12:15
24,24, DNA matches could be connected via social media.,11/9/2009 9:22
24,1216," hi, do you like fish?",5/2/1994 6:15
24,1216," Yes, I love fish do you?",6/7/1999 14:52
24,24, yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew,12/5/1986 4:10
25,25," Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?",6/3/1987 8:31
25,25," that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species",6/12/2000 16:43
25,25," Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.",11/3/2022 7:43
25,25, yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves,2/2/2008 8:18
25,336," Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?",11/20/2010 6:45
25,336, that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal,11/11/1979 9:28
25,25," I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?",2/15/2001 7:41
25,25," that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away",6/21/1980 11:24
25,336," lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.",8/6/1986 11:25
25,336, yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence,7/21/2005 17:33
26,523," I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.",4/24/2005 17:35
26,523, do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?,10/24/1997 6:57
26,26," Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow",11/16/1985 3:18
26,523, I do not even know how many zeros are in that number,8/9/1980 19:50
26,523," lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.",12/14/1983 2:19
26,26, and Roosevelet did not have any of them,9/1/2008 21:20
26,26, He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.,11/23/1994 23:34
26,26, I like that too. nice chat,12/14/2019 9:28
26,26, Hello,2/26/2003 16:02
26,523, Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them.,11/30/2017 5:44
27,27," No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat",1/15/1995 12:04
27,27," That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?",9/14/1978 20:29
27,27," Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.",6/24/2016 22:08
27,27, Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?,2/10/1984 19:41
27,27," Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats",3/9/2022 15:00
27,27, I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.  ,11/9/2016 13:22
27,27, Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.,4/2/2017 21:23
27,1903, Do you have any now?  I have two.,10/3/1989 17:40
27,1903," No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish",7/19/1982 16:31
27,27, I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes.,3/13/2002 1:04
28,1597, I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question.,12/5/2017 16:07
28,1597, Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is.,1/13/1984 18:52
28,1597," No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal",11/1/1998 15:05
28,1597, Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?,11/23/2011 13:31
28,28," Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",6/12/2021 18:35
28,28, And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!,4/17/1972 9:34
28,28," Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",8/9/1970 11:53
28,1597, I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges.,9/8/1990 8:44
28,28, Me too. Thanks for the informative chat.,9/13/1990 17:23
28,28," Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?",3/27/1971 14:37
29,1050," No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.",9/3/2006 1:39
29,29," Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight.",8/27/2015 10:58
29,29, I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.,12/7/2015 0:07
29,29, Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. The immortal Jelly fish. ,11/3/2001 1:30
29,29," I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.",2/11/2003 1:13
29,1050, Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.,3/27/1987 12:33
29,29," Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.",6/29/2011 15:59
29,1050, I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.  ,5/26/2012 0:25
29,1050," While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?",2/17/2009 3:16
29,1050, Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck. ,11/24/1974 11:43
30,179," Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin.",10/26/2021 6:29
30,179," If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. ",6/2/1975 8:54
30,30, I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?,1/14/1974 6:19
30,179," If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny.",9/11/2013 7:29
30,30," Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.",12/25/2005 18:48
30,179, Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.  ,11/15/2018 21:30
30,30," Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?",6/16/1977 23:10
30,179," Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? ",8/31/2011 6:50
30,30," Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?",8/8/2007 14:19
30,179, Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder. ,1/21/2014 3:19
31,31," Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.",9/13/1983 18:30
31,31, You as well!!,5/14/2020 3:47
31,331, Thanks.,11/11/1991 9:38
31,31," hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?",10/6/1986 7:30
31,331," Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!",5/29/2013 3:21
31,31," haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia",4/17/1998 16:37
31,331," Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?",12/1/1983 5:39
31,31," no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?",3/27/2007 10:15
31,31, I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.,12/17/1999 16:01
31,31," ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen",10/10/2021 8:52
32,286," They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?",7/22/2001 6:44
32,286," no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such",4/22/2007 1:29
32,286," In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.",1/1/1985 16:14
32,32," hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, Guardians haha",3/8/2000 10:08
32,286," Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ",9/14/2003 17:38
32,286," ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha",10/28/1997 18:02
32,32, Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.,3/24/2016 21:50
32,286," haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it",11/9/2016 8:57
32,286, Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.,4/6/2020 3:26
32,286, I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck,10/12/1986 15:44
33,33, So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin.,2/7/1996 15:42
33,33," yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!",5/6/1999 1:11
33,33, How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!,4/5/1984 12:05
33,33," haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?",3/31/2008 20:02
33,743, What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?,7/31/1972 1:33
33,743," I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, Gimme back my child look!",5/15/1991 6:07
33,743," LOL yep you don't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is",5/19/1971 21:58
33,33, Was it a smuggling thing?,6/13/1976 2:36
33,743, Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately,9/8/2022 14:43
33,33," With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?",3/26/2010 2:05
34,1149," Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?",2/8/1987 20:00
34,1149," Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.",11/22/1992 17:11
34,1149, Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002,1/15/1996 18:18
34,34," I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, 12 angry hamsters",1/21/2015 19:59
34,34," Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL",4/30/1976 1:19
34,1149, Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda. ,5/17/2014 10:55
34,1149," It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the protection of animals act. hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it",2/3/1981 22:44
34,34," Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. ",10/25/1993 5:30
34,1149, That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal,11/22/1979 9:15
34,1149," Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...",11/3/1999 1:27
35,989," Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha",10/31/1973 21:30
35,989," Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?",8/12/2009 16:35
35,989, Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?,6/11/1990 23:39
35,989," Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...",9/1/2002 8:47
35,989," Haha that's a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here",2/2/1972 7:16
35,989, Can you recommend any movies to watch?,10/11/1976 2:50
35,989, Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix. ,10/20/1999 14:18
35,35, Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?,7/25/1974 12:21
35,989," Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?",4/3/1989 3:47
35,989, Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role,5/6/2007 12:12
36,1358," He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ",3/7/2002 14:23
36,1358, Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?,12/14/2016 0:02
36,1358," Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. ",8/25/2017 3:56
36,1358, I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend,7/10/1977 16:04
36,1358, In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons. ,1/2/1985 0:01
36,1358, Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of,1/28/1986 15:18
36,1358," I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ",1/23/2009 18:53
36,1358, I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.,8/13/2019 20:30
36,36, Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ? ,8/29/1980 1:15
36,1358, I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie,5/28/2019 5:31
37,37," They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. ",5/21/1973 0:22
37,37, Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things,2/6/1993 6:02
37,1401, There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog. ,10/21/1986 10:41
37,1401, I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day,1/6/1998 2:51
37,37," Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.",8/8/2018 2:38
37,37, Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing,4/1/1979 1:57
37,1401, Good Morning! How are you today?,11/9/1992 15:38
37,37," Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump.",2/28/1975 10:25
37,37, I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!,2/11/2003 16:07
37,37," I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,",10/3/2004 17:49
38,38, A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!,6/9/1988 13:10
38,38," People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.",6/9/1979 13:04
38,38, I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?,9/17/1984 22:54
38,38," I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.",4/10/1991 4:52
38,38, Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?,3/11/2014 4:36
38,38," There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.",12/26/2017 21:15
38,808, I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha.,2/8/1989 23:09
38,38," That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.",9/18/1996 3:38
38,808," All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too.....",11/3/2018 2:23
38,808," Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general? ",10/17/2011 5:36
39,39," I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?",8/7/1983 15:51
39,617," Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.",11/5/1997 6:40
39,39, It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?,5/18/2002 6:01
39,617," I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.",1/6/2019 0:40
39,617, Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!,7/19/1970 8:38
39,617, Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  ,11/26/2011 14:03
39,39," Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!",7/15/2004 13:14
39,617, Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!,12/8/2008 7:53
39,39, I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off. ,4/14/1976 19:52
39,39," Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment.",8/20/1997 20:08
40,40, I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank. ,2/22/1973 3:33
40,40," Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!",10/7/2013 22:08
40,40, Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that. ,5/21/2018 0:00
40,1218, Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!,6/15/1998 0:58
40,1218, That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?,10/24/1991 13:31
40,40, Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!,11/22/1981 2:17
40,1218, That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange. ,4/5/1992 13:17
40,1218, Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.,3/19/2010 20:37
40,1218," I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?",8/25/2009 4:33
40,1218, I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.,5/22/1996 11:19
41,41, Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas. ,3/22/2006 22:29
41,469, Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.,1/21/1980 3:50
41,469, That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?,9/23/2001 16:40
41,41, Oh yeah you're right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!,11/18/1995 4:06
41,41, Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially. ,4/29/2012 18:34
41,41, Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!,8/15/1989 11:06
41,41, I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well. ,2/18/2011 1:06
41,469, Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!,5/4/1971 17:03
41,469, did you see that Kanye is having another kid?,9/13/1990 21:06
41,41, I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :),8/21/2013 9:53
42,42, I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that!,6/23/2004 11:09
42,42," ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...",1/29/1993 4:00
42,1507," Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.",2/17/2019 10:32
42,1507, ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?,7/22/2022 18:19
42,42," Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though.",5/11/1970 5:12
42,42, I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world... ,4/22/2000 13:21
42,42," I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)",10/18/1980 17:12
42,1507," lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;)",1/22/1999 19:18
42,1507, I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.,9/29/1985 9:38
42,1507, Doesn't music needs melody ? ;),7/10/1993 21:26
43,957, Lots of rap does have that!,4/11/1989 2:06
43,957, a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;),8/26/2020 2:58
43,957, I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then,6/16/2002 15:36
43,957," Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)",3/26/2013 7:03
43,43, I'll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful,10/18/1998 20:47
43,43, I don't listen to country but I don't mind it. It has it's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country...,8/6/1985 0:59
43,43, I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage ,10/18/2000 23:14
43,43, I agree... I mean I haven't heard anything new that's good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band,2/6/2002 0:53
43,43, Can't say I know them!,1/24/1998 21:20
43,43, Do you like rap music?,1/8/2014 8:21
44,1350," I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant.",10/22/1992 10:12
44,44," I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. ",5/5/1996 15:57
44,1350," I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.",10/21/2003 4:20
44,1350," That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?",6/11/2022 21:54
44,1350," Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie.",12/26/2009 23:11
44,1350, I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?,8/13/2021 5:34
44,1350," The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.",3/18/2020 8:56
44,44," Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?",3/18/2022 8:29
44,44, I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the tip of the hat originates from Knights raising their visors.,7/7/2009 6:49
44,44, That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.,5/14/1999 13:24
45,1152," They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.",12/12/1985 17:20
45,1152, Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin. ,5/30/2017 11:48
45,45, That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.,1/13/2014 6:58
45,1152, Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.,3/24/1971 1:13
45,1152," I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap.",4/20/1985 5:32
45,45," Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. ",11/3/2001 11:40
45,1152," Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. ",12/1/2012 11:41
45,1152, So his initials are K.O.W. That's funny! ,7/17/1977 16:41
45,45," I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?",11/9/1971 13:40
45,45, Yes it was hilarious! ,4/22/1980 5:58
46,1834," Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.",6/14/1975 17:48
46,1834," I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. ",5/24/2015 18:44
46,1834, Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?,6/26/2000 3:33
46,1834," haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.",11/6/1971 3:28
46,46, I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.,5/27/2009 13:07
46,1834, What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?,11/30/2017 20:30
46,1834," They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!",10/12/2003 3:25
46,46," Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993.",8/1/2021 16:59
46,46, I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor.,5/4/2000 5:38
46,46," They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.",6/8/1974 11:44
47,47, Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked.,3/11/1991 13:14
47,640," Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards",10/18/1987 3:53
47,640, I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!,10/7/1995 15:35
47,640," Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913.",5/29/1990 18:21
47,47, Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,5/14/1979 8:46
47,47, I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years.,6/24/2016 4:58
47,640, Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.,11/4/2014 14:07
47,47, We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do.,4/2/1991 5:54
47,640, It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots.,11/21/1999 11:08
47,640," Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.",12/8/1991 1:46
48,48, Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?,2/3/2014 22:34
48,48," nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.",3/8/2017 2:27
48,48, That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!,7/13/2014 12:58
48,430, Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?,7/27/1990 5:15
48,430," My son is, so I know a little bit about it.",7/4/2001 13:31
48,430, Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.,7/16/1998 11:18
48,430," No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.",8/29/2001 7:06
48,48, There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!,1/19/1989 15:37
48,430, 20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights?,1/26/2002 11:14
48,430, Didn't George Lucas get them somehow?,1/29/1974 4:22
49,49," Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. ",10/17/2013 23:12
49,349, Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!,1/22/2004 11:58
49,49," 20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet.",6/17/1983 20:11
49,49, You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!,8/26/2001 0:04
49,49," I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.",4/9/1996 18:24
49,49, Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.,7/13/1971 11:06
49,349," It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?",6/30/2000 11:09
49,49, Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.,12/28/2000 6:55
49,49," Sorry, what I meant was she won the award. About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.",5/14/2012 13:40
49,49, Wow.  That sure doesn't.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?,9/9/1979 6:54
50,50, I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!,10/19/2011 3:45
50,505, On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,8/13/1979 5:49
50,50, I heard about it and we need to do something about it.  ,3/1/1995 1:07
50,505, I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!,8/26/1993 5:04
50,505, I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.,7/27/1995 12:33
50,505, Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.,9/17/1987 15:28
50,50, Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop!,9/12/1972 12:13
50,505, Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.,2/18/1996 12:01
50,505," I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!",5/12/2018 12:54
50,50, Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?,7/19/1976 10:37
51,51, Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?,10/22/1978 14:09
51,51, Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director.,7/2/2007 6:45
51,1566, I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!,6/12/2000 10:10
51,51, Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.,9/13/2011 11:05
51,1566, I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music!,2/27/1992 19:15
51,51," That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.",2/1/2015 4:55
51,1566," Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?",11/26/1995 22:27
51,51, Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!,12/28/1972 19:53
51,51, I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha.,1/2/2000 3:30
51,1566, Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!,8/20/1975 9:53
52,1298," I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!",1/12/2009 14:19
52,52, Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.,1/20/2022 22:39
52,52, That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!,11/30/1973 14:26
52,1298," Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!",4/4/2022 16:16
52,1298," I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!",9/26/1994 23:52
52,1298, You as well. Goodbye now!,3/9/1978 17:30
52,1298," Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?",11/16/1981 20:09
52,1298," Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.",6/7/2018 6:25
52,1298," lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?",4/26/1974 20:49
52,1298, I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates.,11/4/2008 3:22
53,53, I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?,12/15/1977 0:19
53,1854," yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican",6/5/1972 2:09
53,53," Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!",11/24/1995 4:02
53,1854," They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election",11/28/1992 15:34
53,1854, Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!,6/23/1992 19:49
53,53," I know, id be skipping out on that election.",6/13/2013 18:21
53,1854, I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.,11/22/1987 3:46
53,53," Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.",5/30/1996 23:46
53,53, Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!,3/27/2007 12:53
53,53, It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.,1/11/2005 15:15
54,54," Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol",2/13/1996 10:02
54,54, Keep them working.  LOL,5/1/1978 9:08
54,320," Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. ",9/15/1982 0:20
54,320," I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.",4/16/2018 7:08
54,54, I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!,9/30/2010 10:01
54,54, For real!  Have a good one!,7/31/2019 16:16
54,320, You too! Have a good night!!,4/1/1975 13:32
54,320, Do you know much about politics?,7/16/2004 19:57
54,54, Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about?,1/6/2002 6:12
54,54," I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?",10/29/1994 21:11
55,55," What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. ",4/2/2022 17:11
55,1505," Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. ",12/12/2002 5:57
55,1505," That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings?",8/15/1973 9:40
55,55, I don't. Tell me more.,5/7/2009 2:00
55,1505," He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ",10/6/2013 15:02
55,55," Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates voting option for presidential elections.",8/4/1973 13:29
55,1505, Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  ,1/27/2022 17:26
55,55, The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess. ,9/25/1986 0:52
55,55," Well, we'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. ",4/6/2012 10:52
55,1505, That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918.,5/26/2021 7:23
56,1266, I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918. ,9/25/1971 3:01
56,56," I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. ",7/1/2014 4:03
56,56, That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted? ,6/28/2022 22:44
56,1266, I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993. ,5/2/2009 5:26
56,56, I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections. ,10/20/1988 12:49
56,1266, Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter.,7/5/1999 12:34
56,56, I think I've read that before! Wild to think about. ,5/19/1997 14:18
56,1266, Nice chatting with you. Thanks!,5/30/1983 10:59
56,56," Hey how are you, can't believe that Georgia senator got arrested!",12/25/2008 16:00
56,56, She said she was peacefully chanting.,9/12/1973 4:54
57,57," That's interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.",11/9/1978 12:42
57,1813, It's interesting that astronauts vote from space! ,12/31/2017 11:39
57,1813," For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?",12/15/1976 14:39
57,57," Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.",11/25/1976 16:31
57,57," I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?",2/6/1974 17:18
57,57," Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.",4/19/1977 16:02
57,1813," That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. ",5/16/1994 14:01
57,57, Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence!,5/15/2022 11:04
57,1813," Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4, I should run for president lol. ",11/30/1996 16:07
57,57," Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",3/6/1986 14:42
58,1026," Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?",5/10/2002 15:34
58,1026, It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people.,7/15/1972 1:25
58,58," Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?",3/5/2006 18:31
58,1026," Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.",2/2/1989 1:49
58,1026," Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too.",6/7/1998 22:16
58,58," I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.",6/24/1983 12:57
58,1026," For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more!",3/7/2002 8:54
58,1026," Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.",8/26/2002 2:01
58,58," Very cool. Great chatting with you, I'm going to take off though, take care!",6/24/1975 0:44
58,1026, did you watch the movie Frozen?,1/23/1989 8:55
59,59," I did and loved it so much, and you?",8/7/2013 3:12
59,59, me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?,8/5/2004 15:23
59,380," Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing",3/2/2015 0:26
59,380, I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie,2/1/2001 0:36
59,380, Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain,11/30/2005 10:29
59,59, Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen,4/23/2017 12:47
59,380," Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad",12/31/1985 0:10
59,59, That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change,1/9/1977 17:44
59,380, Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason,9/23/2012 6:46
59,380, Yeah. DO you have a pet?,12/1/2010 6:14
60,327, I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?,7/19/1995 9:35
60,327, I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?,2/14/1980 18:20
60,60, Yes and there are blood drives for dogs,1/6/1979 18:15
60,60, So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs,4/12/1985 4:21
60,327, Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles,10/28/2018 7:36
60,327, Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved,8/19/2011 19:44
60,327, I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing,10/24/1977 16:38
60,327, Yes and same goes for the elephants as well,10/30/2000 13:48
60,327, Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems,11/30/1989 18:02
60,327," Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication",4/26/1993 17:25
61,61," I know right, dogs deserve that though",2/5/2001 4:37
61,61, Do you like baseball ?,1/29/2015 6:09
61,102, I have heard of it. Do you?,9/30/2013 14:00
61,102," I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. ",2/17/2004 9:11
61,102," That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work.",4/5/1999 22:54
61,102," Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  ",12/19/2014 0:23
61,102," Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure.",7/25/2019 7:25
61,102," I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? ",12/29/2013 13:38
61,102," I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. ",4/7/1975 6:19
61,61," I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ",1/18/1979 7:04
62,762," Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. ",12/18/1996 19:10
62,762," Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ",6/4/2007 4:39
62,762, Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.,9/6/1972 21:49
62,762," Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ",12/3/2017 5:00
62,62," Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands.",7/31/2004 0:22
62,762," As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?",4/12/1991 15:08
62,762, I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you? ,2/10/1992 16:17
62,62," Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. ",7/23/1989 6:49
62,62, Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV.,12/24/1988 11:00
62,762," Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.",4/29/2014 3:03
63,1809, It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?,7/23/1989 16:32
63,63," There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ",10/30/1990 6:51
63,1809," The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!",10/25/1977 21:04
63,1809," You too, have a good evening.",6/25/1986 7:36
63,63, Hi there are you a baseball fan?,7/30/2018 9:26
63,1809, i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?,9/19/1998 6:37
63,63, I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.,6/25/1984 0:52
63,63, I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager.,5/16/1970 23:24
63,63, I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time.,1/24/1982 14:24
63,1809," yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.",5/10/1986 13:25
64,188, Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.,4/5/1987 19:01
64,188," Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.",2/21/2021 18:37
64,64, Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot.,12/19/2007 11:43
64,188," Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?",6/7/1993 12:57
64,188, I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol,7/25/1976 19:42
64,188," Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?",12/4/2022 4:37
64,64, I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!,9/3/1984 14:47
64,64, Really? the womens game? do men play as well?,12/21/1974 6:10
64,188," lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!",1/10/1989 21:59
64,64," Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.",7/25/2012 3:41
65,65, No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.,7/23/2009 18:06
65,843, He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball. ,2/28/1985 1:45
65,843, Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!,12/24/2014 23:45
65,843," Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!",2/9/2014 15:01
65,65, You have a great weekend too!,12/29/1971 17:40
65,843," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?",7/10/2000 23:26
65,843, Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?,6/29/2006 11:58
65,65," I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs?",2/10/2020 8:53
65,65, Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying calledLet It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen,2/9/1974 21:19
65,843, HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards?,2/2/1975 2:17
66,66," I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character",9/21/1974 6:53
66,66, that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?,5/28/1999 0:56
66,66," There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.",2/5/1983 20:59
66,857, Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.,10/30/1970 9:53
66,66, I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set,7/26/1991 5:36
66,66," Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.",11/20/1979 8:02
66,857, Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves,12/3/1973 19:20
66,857," A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.",7/30/1993 9:04
66,66," Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist",4/14/1985 21:19
66,66, I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice.,3/26/2007 10:07
67,67, I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?,1/2/1989 10:34
67,1229, The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.,9/25/1998 16:49
67,1229, Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!,7/16/2003 19:00
67,67, Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!,9/30/2012 13:25
67,1229, I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha,8/23/1990 2:57
67,67, Have a good night,4/28/1991 17:15
67,67," Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can",12/1/2022 14:15
67,1229," Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.",2/12/1998 20:59
67,1229," Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter",9/1/1992 10:34
67,67," Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws.",9/10/2006 4:45
68,68," Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult",9/20/2013 9:24
68,68," Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.",1/16/1995 17:59
68,68," It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that",8/31/1976 16:18
68,51, You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.,11/19/1983 12:34
68,51, I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school,6/1/2001 6:11
68,51," Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation.",4/14/2020 18:51
68,51," Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie",1/22/2000 16:38
68,51," Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety.",12/24/2001 16:15
68,51, I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!,12/20/1982 0:59
68,68, I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?,11/25/2006 13:44
69,69, Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!,4/19/1980 2:19
69,1616," Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.",3/31/1997 7:07
69,69," yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!",12/26/1980 21:41
69,69," Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!",8/11/1989 6:52
69,69," Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember...",8/23/2020 4:36
69,69," Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.",1/10/1982 22:28
69,1616, Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to de-feminize things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/,4/14/1978 1:51
69,69," hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!",1/24/2013 15:18
69,69, Have a lovely day as well :),9/30/1983 3:03
69,1616, Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of Frozen the movie? I personally Looooved it!,5/30/1986 16:31
70,1723, I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?,12/3/2000 18:32
70,70," both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars",5/20/1994 15:52
70,1723," That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?",1/8/2017 5:47
70,70," That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?",10/11/2000 19:28
70,70, I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?,11/21/1979 10:52
70,70," Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?",7/4/1982 4:48
70,1723," I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.",3/27/1999 21:46
70,1723," Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown",5/27/2012 20:29
70,1723," I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.",8/27/1994 13:55
70,1723, Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!,7/31/1995 15:44
71,71, Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it.,2/7/1993 12:10
71,1231," Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney",10/25/1974 10:32
71,1231," I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.",12/30/2018 6:51
71,71," Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!",12/27/1980 21:46
71,71, It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time.,12/17/2010 0:43
71,1231," Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! ",4/20/2015 12:56
71,71, Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps.,5/11/2019 12:00
71,71, Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!,7/15/2018 19:27
71,71, That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!,2/22/2009 18:18
71,71," Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)",2/2/2022 15:59
72,72, Have a good evening!,4/26/1994 2:30
72,1646, you too,6/24/1988 0:59
72,1646," I have never heard of Fanfest,",7/7/1984 14:39
72,1646, Hey! What is FanFest? lol,1/26/1984 0:00
72,72," I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol",4/7/2000 14:24
72,72, Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?,5/11/1982 16:58
72,1646," No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military",12/22/1973 20:27
72,72, It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange. ,11/9/2007 5:16
72,72, it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12,7/12/1996 18:52
72,1646," after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.",2/17/1979 18:53
73,961, But would you categorize them as an art form?,12/18/1975 3:02
73,73, Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?,4/9/2009 5:03
73,73," I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form",11/30/2016 2:19
73,961," It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.",6/8/1976 3:31
73,73," Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well",2/27/1970 1:42
73,961, Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?,8/12/1982 2:22
73,961," I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?",7/14/1978 9:38
73,961," Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember.",8/3/2007 1:10
73,73," I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.",2/26/1979 8:02
73,961," Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha ",7/3/1982 23:33
74,74, maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe,11/10/2014 0:20
74,74, Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol,9/2/1991 20:31
74,74, Thank you for your time but I must go now,10/11/1976 17:58
74,1670, Have a good day! Thanks.,6/13/1975 0:39
74,74, bye,1/17/2007 7:44
74,1670, bye!,5/8/2013 8:31
74,74, Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?,4/5/1996 4:41
74,74," No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?",10/11/1977 14:33
74,1670," Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.",11/17/2019 20:24
74,1670," No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL",10/30/1976 5:24
75,1150," Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?",6/15/2002 3:35
75,75," Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal",8/16/2016 13:31
75,75," Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?",3/12/1991 12:50
75,75, LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha,3/23/1976 23:58
75,75," I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.",1/25/2002 0:57
75,1150," Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks",12/26/2002 11:04
75,1150," Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.",12/20/2009 19:19
75,75, Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL,7/31/2011 16:36
75,1150," I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.",5/28/1981 20:03
75,75," I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry",5/8/1973 13:00
76,76, Stephen Fry from Top Gear?,10/14/2006 1:58
76,76," I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?",6/28/1990 16:25
76,157," I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?",4/23/1991 7:58
76,157," Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol",4/16/2012 1:57
76,76," Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?",1/31/2011 9:22
76,76," No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money",3/21/1988 14:44
76,157," Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!",9/10/1992 17:47
76,157," Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun",1/24/2016 14:45
76,157," Hi, how are you?",7/7/1991 1:44
76,157, Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?,8/20/2021 19:30
77,61, A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?,2/28/2017 8:27
77,77," I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.",11/22/2002 15:08
77,77," I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.",9/7/2008 11:11
77,77," Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.",5/21/1977 5:55
77,61, Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!,2/18/2008 1:32
77,61, Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!,3/26/1988 23:19
77,61, I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!,3/7/1982 7:53
77,61," Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.",4/27/1971 21:09
77,61, I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it.,8/22/1985 12:59
77,77, That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.,10/28/1975 11:39
78,898, I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!,7/9/2022 16:38
78,78, That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.  ,1/9/1989 4:29
78,78, There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?,12/16/1998 19:01
78,78," Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.",8/7/1989 18:40
78,78, They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!,12/14/1981 9:45
78,78, I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy,11/13/2006 2:24
78,898, Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.,4/17/2001 6:59
78,898, Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a biohazard,8/15/1984 8:21
78,898, Agreed! Nice chatting with you!,3/27/1977 5:36
78,898," hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?",3/5/2003 10:07
79,79," Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?",7/31/2017 12:52
79,79, me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?,4/14/1998 10:55
79,1209, I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy. ,8/31/1998 3:21
79,79, I wonder how that would work today though.,8/8/1984 14:51
79,1209," Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. ",9/25/1999 14:57
79,79, yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot.,1/14/2009 21:59
79,79, Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year. ,1/29/1975 8:02
79,79, I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote,5/3/1995 8:18
79,79," Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!",7/5/2015 6:20
79,79, yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.,9/3/1978 7:22
80,763, That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?,11/30/1977 16:18
80,763, hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates,4/3/2015 5:16
80,80," Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. ",10/17/2000 20:00
80,80, did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012,10/19/2008 18:04
80,763," No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? ",11/24/1987 9:04
80,763," maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?",5/11/2018 12:44
80,763," No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?",11/9/2008 0:54
80,80, It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.,8/6/2003 13:24
80,763," Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  ",3/18/2022 23:53
80,80, I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you.,10/5/1995 14:42
81,81, Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten,9/30/2011 12:23
81,1862," It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational!",2/1/1977 13:40
81,81," Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius",7/2/2002 22:06
81,1862, There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like nurses run)!,8/27/1970 19:52
81,81," Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems?",11/15/2005 3:15
81,81, I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know The Raven was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?,10/23/1991 2:01
81,1862," Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid",10/12/2009 22:35
81,81, Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.,12/28/1991 4:05
81,81," I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,",11/28/2015 12:43
81,1862, That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!,4/23/1986 16:56
82,1541," That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero",9/13/2005 7:06
82,1541," Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.",5/24/2017 8:22
82,1541," I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.",3/12/1995 21:56
82,82," Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!",5/16/2019 7:34
82,82," Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?",2/10/2002 8:25
82,82," It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.",8/19/2001 14:35
82,1541," I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.",6/18/1983 12:33
82,82," Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.",12/15/2000 21:30
82,1541," I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, ",7/31/1975 9:14
82,1541," Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of computer that was though.",3/31/2010 13:04
83,285," I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech",6/7/2013 1:54
83,285, Do you like to use computers? ,5/16/2012 18:19
83,285, Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.,3/9/2006 5:24
83,285," Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. ",12/7/1987 6:34
83,285, Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.,9/1/2016 15:49
83,285," Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?",8/5/2002 4:33
83,83, I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!,6/25/2018 22:32
83,83," That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? ",7/7/2007 22:39
83,285, I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!,6/16/2009 13:05
83,83, I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft? ,6/16/2020 2:51
84,84, I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.,1/9/1994 4:59
84,84," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? ",7/5/1995 21:04
84,314, Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.,5/11/1995 2:31
84,314, I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram. ,5/18/2014 3:23
84,314, Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.,3/27/2019 10:36
84,84, I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers? ,2/8/1988 5:19
84,84, I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction.,12/12/1990 12:09
84,314, That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki? ,11/15/2004 11:17
84,314, Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early.,6/11/1987 21:18
84,314, Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!,3/5/2017 0:43
85,85, A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!,8/19/1989 10:38
85,85, Nice chatting with you too!,6/22/1974 21:18
85,1834, Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.,4/10/2022 16:05
85,85," Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?",10/9/2019 22:19
85,85, I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs. ,4/18/1973 8:02
85,1834, I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.,4/24/2007 3:27
85,1834," Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy.",4/5/2015 4:28
85,85," I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?",3/10/1981 16:46
85,1834, I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!,10/5/2022 19:14
85,85," that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.",1/22/1990 0:27
86,86, Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.,9/1/1976 11:09
86,1069," He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.",5/28/1972 18:30
86,86, Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal.,11/25/1987 19:17
86,1069," Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. ",10/2/2017 19:48
86,1069," That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?",12/26/2001 23:45
86,1069, I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world. ,4/2/2020 18:37
86,1069, That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from.,1/17/2015 6:50
86,86," the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. ",3/27/1979 0:29
86,86, Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.,5/19/1976 22:35
86,1069," Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.",10/14/2000 2:53
87,1595, Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.,7/14/1975 1:20
87,87," What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!",7/25/1987 14:34
87,1595, Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.,12/26/1998 7:40
87,87," Hello there, do you use Amazon?",11/27/2022 17:59
87,1595," Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website.",8/28/2016 4:52
87,87," Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. ",2/6/1988 21:26
87,1595," Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?",1/14/1978 2:33
87,87, No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?,2/1/1985 9:37
87,87," No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?",8/25/2005 20:38
87,87, Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves. ,10/20/1988 22:04
88,1009," Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.",5/26/1977 10:11
88,88," Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?",6/13/1981 8:11
88,88," No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.",7/10/2004 11:03
88,88," Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?",11/2/2021 6:43
88,88," No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.",2/14/1979 8:50
88,88," Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. ",2/10/2022 8:44
88,1009," most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?",5/22/1982 3:55
88,1009," No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!",4/30/2008 13:03
88,88," Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?",1/28/1986 23:33
88,88, Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well. ,11/23/1974 8:43
89,559," every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side.",1/27/1987 19:09
89,559, Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other. ,5/27/2015 11:19
89,559, Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?,4/29/1979 10:30
89,559," Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",7/24/2012 3:15
89,89," Hello friend, Do you like horses?",9/2/1991 0:44
89,559, I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?,4/14/2010 17:18
89,559," Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? ",5/8/2000 6:12
89,89, That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today.,3/6/1970 4:04
89,89," Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses.",1/6/1979 6:36
89,89, I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating.,3/24/2001 14:15
90,820," Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",8/21/1999 14:49
90,90, What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?,3/4/1975 9:24
90,820," Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.",3/10/1986 4:58
90,90," I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.",8/23/1998 12:12
90,90," Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.",2/9/1996 1:53
90,90, Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.,1/9/2009 13:10
90,820," No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?",12/5/2012 9:04
90,820, I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.,3/28/2001 2:42
90,90, I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.,4/22/1987 4:11
90,90, I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?,1/4/1984 16:59
91,91," Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow.",8/23/2017 8:45
91,91, Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?,11/12/1981 4:49
91,91," No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.",1/22/2010 9:10
91,1193, I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere.,12/22/2012 12:58
91,1193," That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.",8/29/1995 14:07
91,1193, Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?,5/5/1984 19:26
91,1193," Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do!",5/7/2018 9:09
91,91," I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. ",1/2/2001 20:10
91,91," Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet.",6/13/1993 10:38
91,1193," That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. ",9/23/1999 1:24
92,92," Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.",10/21/2011 8:30
92,346," Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he?",6/16/1999 8:58
92,346," Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.",4/16/2007 22:03
92,346," I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?",4/10/2000 7:32
92,92," Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea?",6/7/1977 14:20
92,346," Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard. What in the world could that mean?",11/25/1994 16:06
92,346," Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!",4/4/1984 6:00
92,92, Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!,6/5/1976 13:07
92,346," Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!",6/18/2010 14:12
92,346," I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!",5/16/1993 22:16
93,1366, Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!,10/19/1973 4:18
93,93," How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ",2/16/1970 16:45
93,1366, That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram! ,7/17/1991 12:47
93,1366," Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. ",11/13/2021 9:48
93,93," Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.",12/12/2010 12:57
93,1366," Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. ",11/10/1991 1:14
93,93, Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!,5/21/2020 0:23
93,1366, Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?,12/6/2009 18:12
93,93," Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!",10/20/1980 18:45
93,93, It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.,6/15/1984 13:02
94,1109," Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?",11/6/1980 1:52
94,1109, If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well!,9/30/2000 3:45
94,1109," I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!",5/19/1997 22:26
94,94, I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!,1/6/1982 20:47
94,94," Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.",3/2/1974 10:41
94,1109, Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!,6/27/1971 16:06
94,1109," Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies?",6/9/1985 6:00
94,1109, You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!,2/27/1993 16:53
94,1109," Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!",2/19/1988 21:51
94,94, Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark!,2/24/1998 12:14
95,596,   I didn't know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up!,3/10/1986 4:59
95,596, They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses.,2/9/2022 18:41
95,95," I know, isn't it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren't Lipizzaner horses beautiful!!",11/29/1986 2:48
95,95, Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!,12/27/1996 13:34
95,596," Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!",9/1/2011 0:37
95,596, I would love to see them in real life! I'm good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month!,3/22/1994 21:07
95,95," Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!",6/27/1975 10:05
95,95, They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night!,12/17/1975 9:20
95,596," Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there? ",5/12/2000 1:57
95,95," Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!",6/24/1972 15:06
96,96," That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. ",3/15/2017 13:41
96,528, They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer,3/25/1985 3:02
96,528," I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York!",8/30/2005 21:49
96,528," Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft",6/20/1986 0:21
96,96," Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! ",6/8/1991 22:52
96,528," An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!",8/18/2001 19:28
96,528, It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift.,12/5/1985 23:48
96,528, that is a lot!,2/10/2022 12:16
96,96," And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!",6/22/1981 6:38
96,528, We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!,1/2/2017 22:44
97,84," Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday!",10/15/1972 19:30
97,84, that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore?,1/6/1996 18:04
97,97," That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!",1/17/2006 18:38
97,97," that is good! Hey, do you like animals?",6/4/1994 4:01
97,84," I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend.",5/9/2006 12:21
97,84," Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named white Shark cafe. I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!",9/2/1975 0:48
97,97," Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body. ",9/9/1979 13:34
97,84," We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!",1/10/1992 6:06
97,84," That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer!",4/13/2006 16:35
97,97, Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!,3/4/2018 22:12
98,98, Good morning.,4/7/1993 23:20
98,98, good morning,2/13/2002 8:38
98,98, Do you keep up with the election?,8/28/1998 5:01
98,98," yeah, but moderately.  You?",10/1/1974 16:46
98,98," yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.",7/3/1995 19:49
98,98, the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election,2/21/2000 11:03
98,98, Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.,11/16/2013 22:52
98,258, I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor?,11/8/1997 2:11
98,258, I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853,1/18/2005 23:26
98,258, Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?,1/14/2000 7:24
99,1709, I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?,4/24/2002 16:00
99,1709, Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?,4/17/2008 2:10
99,99, I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?,1/15/1982 0:26
99,1709," I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name",2/13/1989 10:40
99,1709, Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.,10/19/1999 16:22
99,99," It is weird, but true",9/27/2019 10:02
99,1709, The Beatles song come together was written for a California governor.,1/8/2008 12:50
99,99, There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.,1/8/1978 12:02
99,1709, Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S,8/20/1992 17:20
99,99," I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you",3/17/2020 23:29
100,100, You too. I do not think its in effect though.,1/4/2011 14:04
100,100, hi are you a republican?,2/3/1972 15:36
100,100, No I am not. How about you?,7/1/2000 14:47
100,100," No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853.",7/20/1988 14:07
100,100," Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.",2/11/1980 0:05
100,100," I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election",8/23/2008 1:42
100,100," I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.",5/10/1999 13:45
100,100," For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!",6/10/1990 19:16
100,1448," Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.",11/29/1980 20:23
100,1448," Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!",6/9/2011 11:41
101,101," If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.",11/25/2008 4:44
101,101," For sure, and he would take Trump down.",1/14/1972 3:55
101,101," I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.",7/25/1971 15:56
101,101," Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.",7/29/2006 9:06
101,1720," Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time.",12/13/1970 3:35
101,1720, For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system,4/14/1980 17:11
101,101," Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.",9/7/1999 7:23
101,101," For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!",11/24/1976 18:29
101,101," yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.",10/25/1973 11:11
101,101," for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!",4/26/1989 10:07
102,102," Yeah same to you, good chat.",1/12/2006 23:19
102,102, bye!,5/4/1992 9:23
102,1240," Hello, do you follow politics much?",9/5/2013 6:20
102,1240," Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? ",1/22/1982 16:27
102,1240, Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat,2/24/2005 4:18
102,102," Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that",3/16/1997 16:05
102,102," Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?",4/14/2003 9:36
102,102," Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo",10/6/2005 0:26
102,102, Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?,3/9/2012 21:22
102,1240," Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess",5/13/2021 7:21
103,103," Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that",4/14/2007 2:19
103,201," Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though",4/6/2011 9:24
103,103, Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote,9/21/2011 1:12
103,201, Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?,10/7/1979 0:00
103,201, Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?,6/10/2019 1:14
103,201, Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969,1/6/2009 23:38
103,201, Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day,5/21/1981 0:58
103,201," But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day",5/24/1970 2:26
103,201, Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934,7/11/1970 10:54
103,201, Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw,9/15/1986 0:57
104,1136," In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment",8/5/1973 3:45
104,1136," Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII",4/12/1973 4:39
104,104, Must have been tough being the only guy.,7/17/1980 18:50
104,1136, The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?,12/7/1972 1:34
104,1136, Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times.,8/14/2020 14:15
104,1136," Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though",11/12/1970 18:06
104,1136, That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.,12/17/1988 4:58
104,104," I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,",7/31/2002 3:50
104,1136, Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know.,2/2/1999 8:34
104,1136," So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000",8/29/1993 17:12
105,105, That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.,10/29/1997 13:29
105,1303," It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont",10/29/1981 1:12
105,105," Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%",3/13/2019 22:49
105,1303," And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat",4/13/1979 23:32
105,1303, So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol,1/31/1976 5:07
105,105," We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these''",3/15/1975 21:07
105,1303, They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now.,5/11/2012 1:15
105,1303," They do, seems like the best option at times lol",2/1/2018 8:24
105,1303, It really does.  ,10/19/1973 21:03
105,105, I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day,5/30/1998 13:35
106,1412, It really would1,4/21/1984 18:46
106,1412," He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy",11/15/2022 1:06
106,1412," He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!",7/23/1997 8:56
106,1412," Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot",12/16/2003 17:27
106,106, What did you think of the last couple elections?,11/8/2010 6:38
106,1412, I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote.,6/5/2017 1:16
106,106, That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years,6/17/2005 6:05
106,106, the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot.,6/3/1976 5:15
106,1412," I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?",3/22/1984 21:57
106,106, i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.,6/16/1982 6:28
107,107, yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not,1/28/1972 13:23
107,107," it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.",6/27/1979 2:38
107,107, Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?,5/23/2022 16:54
107,1103," well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.",10/26/1998 3:58
107,1103, Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?,5/24/2016 12:55
107,107," no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ",11/5/1998 3:12
107,1103," Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2",10/6/2007 10:33
107,107," yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.",4/4/1973 8:53
107,1103," for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor",8/19/1996 23:06
107,1103," he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.",4/8/1972 11:18
108,872, He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol,10/19/1972 5:02
108,872," yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.",11/12/1980 14:12
108,872," For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. ",2/1/2015 13:31
108,872," people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.",8/2/1972 18:58
108,872, I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!,6/3/2001 0:20
108,872, No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party.,3/22/1973 13:38
108,108, I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.  ,9/18/1978 18:54
108,108, Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican.,1/14/1998 12:33
108,108, True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college.,7/17/2003 9:33
108,872, Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000.,1/19/1979 4:40
109,844, That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.  ,2/5/2008 0:50
109,844, Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.,3/8/1971 1:35
109,844, I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand.,3/15/2011 0:29
109,844, Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957.,8/16/1982 5:02
109,844," It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL",2/25/1972 22:43
109,109, Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy.,8/19/2022 2:57
109,109, Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse.,9/6/1990 18:47
109,844, Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%.,6/21/1995 10:46
109,109, Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data.,9/18/1975 1:57
109,844, Yeah that is definitely an odd stat.,1/8/1988 12:15
110,110, There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy,6/3/2013 4:27
110,110," Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections.",12/14/2002 8:33
110,1506, So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020.,12/19/2004 7:43
110,110, Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a none of these candidates voting option.,4/4/2012 18:37
110,1506," That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.",10/1/1990 19:28
110,1506, Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!,9/6/2016 22:18
110,110, Do you follow politics?,4/27/2018 0:06
110,110, I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising.,7/8/1999 21:26
110,1506, I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853.,9/22/1991 13:58
110,1506, That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party?,12/19/2020 16:29
111,111, That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then.,10/1/1982 14:32
111,232, Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates voting option for Presidential elections?,6/2/2007 15:11
111,232, I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting.,10/14/1991 22:24
111,111, Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.,9/26/2020 10:16
111,111, That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time.,10/22/1985 0:23
111,111, Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states.,7/2/2001 12:50
111,111, Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do.,12/10/1997 2:13
111,232," I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.",6/24/1981 19:17
111,111, Didn't know that.  I bet that would get old though flying like that every day.,1/27/1997 7:36
111,111, It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign.,10/11/1984 7:31
112,112, I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting.,7/5/2002 15:10
112,112, Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2?,2/7/2001 22:45
112,614, I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people.,2/28/1977 16:57
112,614," It's something else, that's for sure.",4/9/1996 5:37
112,614, In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today.,6/10/2008 14:41
112,614," Wow! Well, Texas elected their first female Governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. ",10/18/1974 2:32
112,614, Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!,8/11/1983 9:48
112,112, Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time. ,7/30/1990 21:41
112,614, Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often.,11/5/2009 5:03
112,614," Crazy, is that true? ",11/11/1988 5:37
113,113," Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?",6/8/2002 17:21
113,113, I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor? ,11/23/2004 20:06
113,1952, Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work. ,8/28/2008 20:17
113,113, Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA? ,1/27/2012 3:44
113,1952," I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909. ",3/6/2014 16:36
113,1952," I did, it must be one boring game! ",6/18/1977 0:06
113,1952, Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before. ,7/22/2012 0:26
113,1952, I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option? ,12/3/2002 3:52
113,113, Wow I didn't know that about Nevada. ,6/24/1972 20:48
113,113," Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there? ",3/2/2010 20:23
114,7, I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?,3/8/2017 4:53
114,7," Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote. ",1/13/2000 17:31
114,114," Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.",12/9/1980 12:45
114,114," Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? ",8/30/1971 20:14
114,114," Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. ",5/31/1982 11:46
114,7," Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest. ",7/22/2003 7:21
114,7, Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?,5/15/1997 4:40
114,7," No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer? ",5/15/1989 21:49
114,7, Do you watch many movies in the theaters?,6/30/1987 17:11
114,7, Yes I love watching movies! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg's jaws.,1/24/2005 2:33
115,115, Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977!,1/7/1975 13:07
115,1750," haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. ",7/31/1975 9:03
115,1750, I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout.,3/7/1973 4:57
115,1750, Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop,5/5/1991 12:43
115,1750," Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.",10/20/1981 15:32
115,1750, He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.,8/7/1993 1:14
115,115, Good thing they didn't! Disney's treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.,11/21/1996 3:23
115,1750," yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office",12/15/2017 8:44
115,1750, Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.,11/7/1983 7:46
115,115, That movie was great and creepy at the same time.  ,7/18/1978 13:07
116,116, Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws.,6/24/1972 23:31
116,648, Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed,10/23/1984 4:52
116,648, That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water.,12/24/1989 7:20
116,116," Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol ",6/14/2016 11:04
116,648," That would be great! If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.",3/21/2004 22:47
116,116," Mind blown!  I love these facts! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth",10/14/1986 16:25
116,648, What?! Thats funny. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.,11/13/1980 4:40
116,116, The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century,3/26/2011 18:08
116,116," Wow. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. ",10/11/1972 16:02
116,116, was good talking to you!,4/17/1990 9:36
117,365, Did you ever watch ET?,5/19/1974 16:11
117,117," Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!",8/25/1970 6:50
117,117, Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?,9/14/1980 18:16
117,117," No, I haven't see it.  Have you?",8/4/1997 8:38
117,117," I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.",12/29/2018 18:07
117,365," Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!",8/2/2018 19:42
117,117," Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.",3/23/1972 18:47
117,117," It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!",5/21/2008 21:24
117,117," Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.",2/16/1999 0:19
117,117," OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?",5/31/2010 22:51
118,525, I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?,4/20/1985 16:28
118,525," Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.",9/26/2004 0:00
118,118, I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.,10/24/2008 1:42
118,118, I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.,7/8/1992 6:56
118,525, Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.,5/7/1994 18:05
118,525," I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!",8/21/1985 17:40
118,118, Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.,3/3/1994 19:53
118,525, That's pitiful!,12/13/1978 4:14
118,118," Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.",6/23/1984 15:11
118,118," Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.  ",9/12/1980 13:42
119,1229," Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!",4/22/2007 7:28
119,119," Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg? ",4/14/1998 10:17
119,119, Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films. ,10/4/2022 15:32
119,119," Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie.",1/4/2002 15:36
119,1229," Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere.",12/13/2016 10:08
119,1229," Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed.",11/10/1985 18:16
119,119, Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies? ,2/9/2001 20:26
119,119," yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times.",11/14/1996 11:44
119,119," Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park.",2/12/1994 19:29
119,1229," Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws?",10/6/1978 19:44
120,481," That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol",3/26/1983 1:27
120,481," Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977?",10/11/1997 19:54
120,120, Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though.,6/12/2022 22:05
120,481, Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time.,3/3/1984 5:55
120,120, You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie.,2/18/1988 12:33
120,120," Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online?",2/22/2007 17:39
120,481, I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre.,9/1/1993 9:59
120,120, Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed?,7/9/1994 3:20
120,481," Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic ",3/11/1989 18:18
120,481," Yes you are right, we can't see it because most of the water is underneath us. ",12/12/2009 19:01
121,121, Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now. Like the lizards. ,3/4/2015 23:33
121,945," when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.",8/15/1995 12:49
121,121, Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie?,9/3/1999 6:29
121,945, In the past it may have been. ,6/6/2014 22:21
121,121," Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day.",1/24/2002 7:26
121,945," Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it? ",10/11/1987 1:16
121,945, I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack.,11/10/1991 6:02
121,945," Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies? ",4/3/2021 0:16
121,945, I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage.,11/30/2011 16:05
121,945, It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it. ,11/18/1974 23:25
122,122, I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days.,12/27/2003 2:03
122,122, It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad. ,7/6/1997 23:48
122,1765," I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird.",11/5/2009 18:47
122,122, I don't either. I saw it at a friends house. ,3/7/2003 20:30
122,122, I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it.,5/26/2010 5:49
122,1765," Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. ",10/29/2012 7:48
122,122, All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.,2/6/1975 1:49
122,1765," Yeah, that is pretty cool. Do you use Roku? ",9/15/1976 17:31
122,122," Yes, I love my ROKU.",4/15/1979 16:56
122,122, Do you recommend getting one of them? ,8/26/2007 22:14
123,556," I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels.",5/8/1970 22:32
123,556, Oh cool. Then maybe I will check that out. Are you a Tom Hanks fan? ,11/29/2014 5:56
123,123, I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying.,11/29/1986 9:49
123,123," I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!",2/22/1995 14:54
123,123, Nice chatting with you too.,9/19/2020 18:59
123,556, Do you know much about the Bible?,3/6/2007 19:45
123,123, some yes,10/18/1985 9:15
123,123, Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow.,8/7/2002 13:42
123,556, I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time,4/21/1979 21:16
123,123, Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!,8/17/2005 17:41
124,124, Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times,7/22/1991 7:01
124,124," Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection.",5/31/2013 3:05
124,1113," I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man.",11/13/1994 15:58
124,124, Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in.,2/10/2020 19:07
124,124, Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion,11/12/2010 11:05
124,124," Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq.",3/22/2014 19:42
124,1113," I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old.",10/8/1979 13:28
124,1113, Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!,3/26/1976 0:10
124,124," I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works!",8/8/1973 3:45
124,1113, I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like good riddance and wild goose chase.,7/27/1976 9:20
125,1305, Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language,2/11/2007 21:25
125,1305, Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts.,1/4/1981 13:35
125,125, I guess that would mean Lewis and Clark were exploring the Western United States while Shakespeare was performing plays in England!,2/14/1987 7:22
125,1305," Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.",2/13/1974 13:43
125,125," Yes, true.  His works can be found in a library, which in Greek language means book+shelf.",4/13/2020 1:14
125,125, I love going to libraries!  I'm a heavy user of them.  It's been fun chatting with you!,2/23/2004 23:08
125,1305, Same thing to you. Good day.,8/6/2009 17:27
125,125, You have a good day too!,12/20/1978 21:46
125,125, There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think?,7/31/1971 12:42
125,1305," That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card?",11/8/2007 10:28
126,1132," I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought.",6/18/1991 0:59
126,1132," I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time.",11/27/2021 22:28
126,1132, That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books.,12/8/2018 13:40
126,1132," Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone?",9/11/2002 9:02
126,126," I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?",4/29/2019 14:03
126,126, The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85!,11/8/2011 15:14
126,1132," Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including good riddance and laughing stock?",4/7/2010 5:21
126,1132," Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare.",6/25/1984 9:03
126,1132," I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!",9/2/2008 7:48
126,1132," Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!",10/7/2005 6:07
127,1181, That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice?,11/11/1976 6:56
127,127, That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages.,2/9/1978 10:47
127,127, That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963.,6/19/1996 4:43
127,127," Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies.",1/3/1972 16:45
127,127," That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.",1/25/2001 17:02
127,127, Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was.,4/5/2006 19:20
127,1181," Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century.",2/12/1993 12:15
127,1181, That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents.,2/26/2006 3:11
127,127," Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.",7/17/1994 6:25
127,127, That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon.,2/25/1974 0:40
128,128, Hi!  How much do you know about planets? ,2/16/2004 2:22
128,938," Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris.",9/29/2008 9:40
128,128," That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name.",3/26/1994 19:31
128,128, I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus.,7/26/1994 3:58
128,128," Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/",2/22/2022 17:23
128,128, You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/,8/29/1980 3:55
128,128," Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet.",8/18/1971 17:57
128,938, I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars.,7/11/1980 20:19
128,128, There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks.,10/24/1976 10:32
128,938, That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation.,1/3/1997 2:20
129,478, I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter.,1/7/2021 0:51
129,478, I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios,6/24/1984 19:55
129,478, Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,9/5/2007 12:56
129,478, Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors?,6/4/2019 1:07
129,478," Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.",2/9/2020 15:42
129,478, That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute.,5/7/1981 21:29
129,129, i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable.,11/29/2020 18:50
129,129, I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina.,6/4/2006 21:38
129,129," Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor.",9/9/1998 4:26
129,478, That's really good to know. The governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool.,2/9/2020 13:28
130,1646, Nice chat!  Have a great day!,10/12/2019 9:09
130,1646, hello do you like dance?,6/3/1996 3:32
130,130, I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer too?,4/7/2013 11:52
130,1646, Yes pretty awesome he even won a cha -cha championship once,8/28/1987 7:07
130,1646," Yes, same with Tupac, he was a ballet dancer too",1/20/2015 1:45
130,130," Yeah and he even was part of a nutcracker production, he was the mouse",5/13/2001 19:17
130,130," Nice. Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week",9/12/2003 16:15
130,1646, Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music,8/9/2021 7:27
130,130," Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart",10/31/2000 4:05
130,130, Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves,10/15/1978 13:04
131,686, Nice. Do you like soundtracks?,12/5/2016 0:02
131,686," Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet?",1/20/1997 5:45
131,131, the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum,12/30/1985 21:56
131,131, Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them.,3/31/1984 1:47
131,686," Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing",2/24/1972 14:43
131,686, I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat,10/29/2015 6:11
131,686, Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?,8/20/2012 2:52
131,686," I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?",3/14/1976 10:18
131,686, Me too. Did you know Bay's average rating for his movies is just 38% there?,6/6/2009 12:25
131,686, Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too,11/4/1977 4:49
132,132, Yeah it seems. It is owned by Warner Bros,4/14/1998 4:03
132,294, Yeah they seem to have their hand on everything,11/3/1995 23:17
132,132, Are you a fan of dance? ,11/24/2006 7:14
132,294, Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing.,4/25/1975 6:09
132,132, They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance.,4/22/1979 2:08
132,294, Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic.,8/7/2012 12:21
132,132," Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value. ",9/20/1990 4:45
132,294, Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?,6/5/2011 5:38
132,132," LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong.",8/21/2001 4:22
132,294," That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode.",1/1/2015 23:42
133,133, And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way.,11/10/2008 21:02
133,133," Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.",12/28/1997 15:41
133,133, So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked? ,12/10/1993 0:56
133,133, Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name.,11/4/2011 3:29
133,133, I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.,9/12/1993 9:30
133,133," Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.",9/21/2009 11:43
133,525," Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to O, Brother, Where Art Thou?. It went octuple platinum.",6/21/2005 11:24
133,133, Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!,11/18/2021 21:20
133,133," That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way.",4/18/1998 16:28
133,525," Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce.",3/27/2021 8:21
134,1428," It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.",3/26/2004 12:51
134,134, Step Up had a really fun soundtrack.,7/16/2009 6:35
134,134, But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes.,2/22/1984 7:16
134,134," Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a Fresh rating.",10/23/1992 7:10
134,1428, Good evening!  Do you know much about Maryland's governor?,4/21/1981 11:18
134,1428," Not too much,  so you?  Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?",3/14/2017 3:04
134,1428," I didn't know that.  Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.",12/15/1971 10:46
134,1428, Thats interesting.  the beatles songcome together was written for 1969 governor campaign.,5/3/1991 10:25
134,134," Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time!",12/16/1987 17:56
134,134, when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol ,11/28/2006 6:56
135,1180, Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say I'll be back!  ,7/6/1979 7:09
135,135, haha good one!   ,9/20/2004 6:58
135,1180, Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote?,4/5/2012 7:31
135,135, Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?,6/6/1982 11:36
135,1180," Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican.",11/7/1993 19:18
135,135," Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol ",3/27/1980 16:34
135,1180, It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.  ,11/28/1976 21:29
135,135," Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  ",2/10/1980 10:53
135,135," The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush.",7/31/1990 2:12
135,1180," Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?  The planet uranus rotates sideways instead of spinning. ",1/7/1992 17:48
136,1366, Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter.,10/11/1970 3:01
136,136, That is cool.  there is a planet that shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!!!  thats insane!,6/25/1995 8:03
136,1366, Wow.  There are some crazy planets out there.  Venus doesn't even have seasons because it doesn't tilt and rotates in a different direction than the rest of the planets that revolve around our sun.,5/10/2017 8:16
136,136," That is really interesting. I heard that astronauts can vote from space, lol. ",11/29/1983 22:22
136,136, Must have been an absentee ballot!  ,6/19/2021 3:55
136,1366," It's been fun chatting,  have a good one. ",5/7/1977 0:14
136,136, Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first.,3/18/2007 17:18
136,1366," You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.",2/19/2007 12:57
136,1366, If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.,6/10/1972 22:17
136,1366," Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating.",3/10/2006 4:51
137,598," I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?",12/5/1990 20:29
137,598, All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party!,11/13/2016 1:08
137,598," Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.",5/7/1980 23:30
137,598," Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?",8/31/2018 15:49
137,598," I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised.",1/9/1975 6:55
137,137, I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that.,11/1/1978 1:03
137,598, I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies.,4/15/1993 22:57
137,598," Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?",5/15/2004 4:05
137,137, I did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him.,12/21/1983 18:35
137,137," That's right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances.",2/22/1993 11:36
138,138, Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video.,12/13/1998 3:16
138,1491," Looked very cool, when he did it!  I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet.  Have you heard anything about that?",6/2/2019 13:02
138,138, I had heard he trained in the ballet. Did you know that the Air Jordan logo is him doing a ballet move?,8/2/1978 0:17
138,1491," Wow, I didn't know that!",11/21/2013 4:22
138,1491, A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!,7/7/1981 14:07
138,138," Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.",9/4/1996 16:31
138,1491," I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!",5/19/1979 15:26
138,138, hello,11/16/1972 20:17
138,138," Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves",9/1/1994 22:35
138,1491, That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that,3/27/1991 5:06
139,201, I didn't either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal.,8/6/1984 4:56
139,139, perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?,11/29/1971 11:42
139,201, Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker.,7/26/1994 3:01
139,201, I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people,8/2/1972 10:30
139,139," Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. ",12/27/2015 0:05
139,201," Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same",8/8/2022 11:07
139,201, Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,4/25/1983 18:53
139,139, That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol,3/22/1987 19:11
139,201, Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%,11/22/1978 10:01
139,201, Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes,9/11/2000 2:29
140,140, I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix.,8/13/2018 15:55
140,1554, I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high,3/7/1976 5:02
140,140," Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.",12/5/1992 21:47
140,1554, true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?,3/20/2002 2:43
140,1554, I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.,3/26/1978 20:22
140,140, Same here. Thought it was very interesting,2/5/1983 3:07
140,1554," No doubt.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum.",4/21/1973 22:39
140,1554, yep.pretty fascinating,2/7/2014 16:44
140,1554, Thanks for the chat.  It was informative.,1/19/1999 1:42
140,140, same. have a good day,5/19/2005 18:42
141,1029," Thanks, you too.",3/14/1989 15:47
141,1029, bye,7/14/2015 18:54
141,1029, How do you like planet earth?,1/6/2019 2:30
141,1029, I find the earth and the solar system very interesting!,4/21/2009 11:11
141,141, It is so interesting! I love learning about planets. Like Jupiters mon Ganymede!,8/11/1990 20:28
141,1029," Yes, I agree! Isn't the Ganymede Jupiters own moon?",9/24/2014 9:49
141,1029," yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing",11/13/1972 18:07
141,1029," Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia?",7/31/2000 11:30
141,1029," I didn't know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know?",6/20/1990 23:09
141,141, Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars!,6/22/2019 7:40
142,142, wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life,9/29/2015 4:46
142,142," Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!! Do you know anything about the solar asteroid belt?",8/3/2022 19:50
142,1377," I do not know too much, i just know there is crazy things that happen out there, how about you?",10/1/1973 17:50
142,142," True,  its has celestial bodies called Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta!",4/27/2015 19:58
142,1377," I need to tough up on my planet facts, you have so many! I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky",3/31/1989 6:40
142,142," Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!",7/2/2009 22:23
142,1377," Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/",6/19/2022 12:27
142,142," Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. ",12/8/2015 16:30
142,142," I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances. We just need some brave souls that are willing to take the chance like the first time we went to space!",3/20/2000 0:45
142,1377," Yes, very brave!! I hope we can do that sometime soon. Are there signs of water on Mars?",10/25/1995 20:20
143,1560, I think there have been theories of underground lakes and the potential of water. I will read up on it more. It was so nice chatting with you and getting good facts!,4/12/2002 8:38
143,1560," Really, I thought there was or at least they thought so!! Yes, enjoyed chatting too!",3/19/1991 12:46
143,143, Have a great night!,6/23/2014 3:09
143,1560, Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad.,9/19/2015 16:42
143,143," Yes, I read about that in the news. The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true...maybe it's sarcastic?",2/28/1977 18:59
143,143, Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess Step Up was a favorite for many.,11/3/1970 8:17
143,143," Seems like it. I never saw it, though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing. Singing, too?",8/24/2012 0:09
143,143," I think so, the Step Up soundtrack had high acclaim. ",2/24/1999 18:50
143,143, I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.,11/20/2019 22:08
143,1560, That's refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned. ,12/17/1999 19:33
144,144," Kids love to dance to soundtracks, too. I think they even have a few video games with dance and music",5/10/2016 12:31
144,1730," Yes, they do.  I didn't know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer.  I thought he just beat up bad guys. ",3/23/2005 13:55
144,1730, That's really cool! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer. He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also great.,11/16/2009 9:51
144,1730, I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights? ,7/17/2010 9:50
144,1730, That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel!,1/10/1973 16:01
144,1730, Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music.,1/29/2008 17:43
144,1730," I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?",10/19/1979 17:18
144,144," If they do, they are probably R rated.  Disney has changed for the worse.  I think it's great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.",1/21/2014 0:32
144,144," Speilberg is amazing! It wouldn't surprise me if he could dance well, too! I wonder if he'd ever play an instrument in another soundtrack?",7/20/2005 11:54
144,1730," Don't know... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different languages. Ilaian, German, etc. ",4/11/1985 5:05
145,1912, That's amazing! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes? It's owned by WB so I wonder if it's hard on Disney or other rivals?,3/30/1984 3:28
145,1912, I wonder if that biases their judgement for WB productions.  No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44% from RT.,5/13/2002 13:04
145,1912," If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, ",5/19/1998 9:20
145,1912, I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!,9/19/1970 19:05
145,145," Hey do you like Star Wars? I know that I like the first three movies, the next three are ok, and I really hate the new ones",2/17/2022 21:56
145,145," I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree. ",1/18/1975 14:41
145,1912, Haha well I'm glad we agree on that. What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016? I thought it was a total disaster haha,8/24/1986 9:34
145,145, I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash heap is nothing. No! I am your Father is the greatest scene of all time.,8/6/1987 13:33
145,145," Oh I agree with you. I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie, although it was only about two and a half hours of work, he hit it out of the park",2/12/1987 11:42
145,145, Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor? ,7/27/1992 3:55
146,146," Yes I have. Doesn't that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange.",11/16/2001 7:59
146,146, Hilarious. I think they are great though. I didn't know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though!,10/17/2010 15:24
146,1365," Yeah I know, he did a great job for the limited time, can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights, that's what made him a billionaire, so crazy I don't think they would do that ever again",6/30/1981 14:06
146,146," I think I can believe it. Good for him, what does the corporation need with something they didn't invent anyways?",4/18/1972 22:45
146,1365," No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild",12/1/2020 8:35
146,146," Yeah, so like the academy awards totally suck. Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think?",7/19/1974 0:31
146,146," No I think that they don't really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I'm glad that he won three times for best actor",4/14/2018 17:06
146,146," By the way, do you watch you tube? Much better than AA!",10/26/1977 15:28
146,146, Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago,7/4/2016 20:35
146,1365," Oh, I can believe it. Google could make it a success, Youtube couldn't succeed on it own. ",7/22/1989 3:35
147,1408," Yep I agree with you. Did you know that YouTube is the second biggest search engine, I assume that Google is the first",3/10/1990 11:47
147,147, I'm surprised it isn't the first to be honest! ,8/5/1975 6:37
147,147, Yeah I know that everyone uses YouTube do you ever watch the music video for Gangnam Style by the way. That is one of the highest viewed videos on youtube,12/30/1999 16:34
147,1408," No, but I have watched it. Good song, good short term fad too!",1/12/2011 8:00
147,147," Yep it was definitely a fad haha. So was Justin Bieber song Baby, I don't think it should be the most disliked video on YouTube, but it's definitely annoying",4/6/1985 14:08
147,147," Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?",3/17/2004 23:36
147,147, I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans.,8/5/2009 12:37
147,1408," That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though. ",5/31/2001 11:30
147,147, Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans,7/27/2007 1:10
147,147, Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid. ,11/5/1995 4:08
148,148, Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier,3/8/2009 11:07
148,148," No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  ",12/27/2010 13:25
148,148, Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.,11/23/2009 8:09
148,148," Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I'm sure they will do.  Hey do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid for doing all the darth vader lines? ",5/17/2012 13:52
148,1832, No. What is it?,10/14/2004 6:42
148,148," I guess he only got paid $7,500, but when I say only, it only took him two and a half hours to do them!",2/25/1977 20:20
148,1832, That's a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $65 billion,1/4/1976 10:23
148,1832," Holy cow, I wonder how much it was worth in 1998, probably less than half of that. ",10/19/1984 14:20
148,148," In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be in navajo",7/15/2016 18:01
148,148, That is awesome!  Did you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record title?,10/9/1986 2:43
149,149, No for what? Fox thought star wars would flop,8/17/1990 11:28
149,864, I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs. ,8/17/2012 10:19
149,864, Do you watch the academy awards? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio,7/17/2010 16:52
149,149, That is crazy!  I heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well. ,4/2/1980 21:24
149,864, The Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013.,1/5/1990 18:41
149,864," What? That is so stupid to me, why an awards show?  Do you know who is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?",8/10/2003 17:23
149,864, Daniel day Lewis I think.,8/28/1973 12:36
149,149," Good call!  He is a great actor though so I can see it, I wonder what roles he won for.  Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York. ",6/20/2002 8:45
149,149, Probably. Blazing saddles was nomonanom for 3 Oscars too. Well have a great night.,6/19/2004 2:20
149,149," Hello, do you like Star Wars?",4/27/1983 5:11
150,150, I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you?,12/6/1997 22:29
150,150, Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award,8/30/1971 8:38
150,150," Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks.",8/30/2016 20:33
150,150, Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo,8/8/1991 21:09
150,1150, Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision.,4/27/2016 12:15
150,1150," Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines",2/15/1987 21:01
150,1150, Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars,12/11/1977 19:04
150,150, Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work,4/6/1986 9:59
150,150," Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion",3/18/1985 2:51
150,150, That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?,11/3/1999 3:45
151,1777," No, I don't. How about you?",11/23/2008 21:48
151,151, I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times?,2/26/1988 7:30
151,151, I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney.,3/17/1985 18:26
151,1777, Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars,12/20/1971 7:55
151,1777, He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars. ,12/31/1984 5:03
151,151, That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names. ,12/29/2005 8:56
151,151," Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role.",3/23/2006 2:27
151,151, That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?,12/24/1974 3:04
151,1777, I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That's sad.,2/5/1973 4:59
151,151, That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :),6/14/1978 12:52
152,318, Hi there!  Are you a Star Wars fan?,5/25/2021 9:25
152,152," Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?",7/31/1975 11:36
152,152, Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best.,10/22/1982 6:49
152,152," It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!",6/1/2001 9:10
152,152, It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following.,3/10/1992 7:27
152,318," It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!",11/11/1970 19:05
152,318, The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend!,2/25/1979 0:45
152,152, And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!!,8/22/1991 15:28
152,152," I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.",12/19/2010 10:54
152,152," Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire",12/21/1978 14:21
153,1170, It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines?,3/1/1971 12:47
153,1170," I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so",2/20/2014 18:03
153,153," Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.",11/16/1972 3:44
153,153," I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?",10/26/1972 6:04
153,153," Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?",7/15/1995 5:07
153,1170, She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job,10/6/1974 1:44
153,153, She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her.,3/4/1976 7:03
153,1170," Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!",4/1/1996 17:53
153,153, Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!,2/9/1987 14:28
153,1170," Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined",8/29/1973 10:45
154,154," I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for.",12/26/1983 22:31
154,1107," Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times?",9/29/1975 20:09
154,1107, Who?  Harrison Ford?,3/10/1975 10:56
154,154," It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment",8/18/2010 8:30
154,154," It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!",10/3/2010 6:54
154,1107, You do the same!!,5/20/1989 23:34
154,1107, Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type. ,9/28/1990 9:07
154,154," I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.",7/3/1997 20:11
154,1107, So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions. ,9/2/1980 17:00
154,154, True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?,8/27/1975 10:15
155,155, Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does. ,3/7/1979 19:11
155,155, I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that.,4/2/2006 7:28
155,1990, With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents. ,3/14/1993 11:18
155,155, Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff.,3/9/1997 23:47
155,155, Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices?,7/15/2015 0:54
155,1990, The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment.,2/19/2014 15:17
155,155, I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other. ,8/16/1983 8:07
155,1990," When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?",1/29/2009 20:13
155,1990, That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society. ,12/30/1985 6:25
155,1990," Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?",1/29/2008 4:11
156,156, I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character. ,1/18/1981 15:44
156,1106, Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that.,7/24/1996 14:49
156,156, I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect. ,1/30/1983 20:30
156,1106," He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.",8/30/1984 8:22
156,1106, That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart. ,1/27/2019 8:37
156,156, I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.,9/20/2011 23:30
156,156, He seems to really be an animal lover too. ,5/29/1994 7:00
156,1106," Many people like to watch horror films, I don't like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century?",2/8/2009 14:58
156,1106," oh yes, I even watched the first Nosferatu movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old...",10/29/1971 21:47
156,1106," That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?",11/23/1971 8:16
157,157, I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;),9/10/1994 19:58
157,157," They are good for your health as well, guess why?",7/26/1998 2:01
157,1640, Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don't know ;),1/12/2004 21:59
157,157," Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?",4/16/2012 13:19
157,157," I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it's no longer scary for You, because You've seen it all ? ;)",7/12/1999 21:30
157,1640," I can't imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies?",2/19/1997 14:41
157,157," well sure, it's just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;)",3/7/1985 18:42
157,1640," The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others.",1/3/1982 8:14
157,157," I mean I wouldn't say it's stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ?",2/28/1979 23:23
157,1640," He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.",3/15/1971 23:49
158,158," ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ??",6/4/2021 3:44
158,158," His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues.",5/10/1971 8:29
158,158, There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there...,8/18/1982 0:18
158,1317, I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion.,4/27/2000 23:43
158,158," I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don't remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ?",3/2/1973 4:53
158,158," I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.",8/2/1985 9:04
158,1317," lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;)",6/26/1979 1:34
158,158," I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.",1/27/2022 18:14
158,1317," yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them...",10/5/1997 15:19
158,1317, I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.  I'm not sure I'd like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though.,9/1/1984 12:09
159,138, Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You 're saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues...,8/14/2022 6:47
159,138, We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do.,4/29/1992 6:52
159,159, it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...,6/21/1994 3:11
159,159," They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke",6/13/2008 13:17
159,159," That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this...",1/15/1993 2:08
159,138," It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy.",1/7/2021 12:00
159,159, I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;),1/13/1975 4:59
159,138," I won't even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though.",4/25/2003 16:13
159,138, Absolutely ;) no argument here ;),5/19/2018 16:22
159,138," If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you.",3/27/2007 11:22
160,160," Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)",5/5/1978 10:33
160,1631, Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK?,11/20/1977 4:23
160,1631, I don't know that much actually. He has a cat though. ,11/7/1974 9:54
160,1631, I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can't say I like cats though haha,8/17/1986 16:47
160,160, Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic? ,12/17/1995 17:29
160,1631, I am actually allergic to cats. And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is?,5/29/1985 16:05
160,1631," yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her. ",6/12/1995 8:18
160,160, Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre,6/16/2006 23:08
160,1631, Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup? ,3/9/2016 0:03
160,1631, I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha,3/4/1981 18:51
161,50," Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. ",1/20/1994 17:26
161,50, That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them,4/7/1981 20:51
161,161," Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there? ",9/12/2006 4:54
161,161, I'm not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they're nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha,10/27/2015 18:17
161,161," That's hilarious, he wasn't even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave? ",9/30/1989 10:43
161,161, Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?,11/29/2021 2:24
161,161," I haven't actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. ",2/9/1991 12:48
161,50, Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess. But I think he would be great for the role,10/3/2003 10:26
161,161," I think that may have already have been released, but maybe I am wrong. ",4/11/2012 7:44
161,50, It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words,11/15/2006 20:48
162,162," It's been a very long time, but yeah I saw it. Now that I think about it, he barely speaks in that film! ",1/9/1989 1:00
162,162, You're right. I do love that movie a lot though. It's a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down,6/11/2013 16:16
162,135," hi, do you like johnny depp?",1/3/1993 0:58
162,135," Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?",10/25/2002 3:07
162,162," He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it",6/26/2007 13:37
162,162, I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?,6/25/2017 5:19
162,162, I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though.,7/24/2011 17:34
162,162, Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage?,9/28/2008 9:46
162,162, He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow,12/8/1980 9:01
162,135, A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes.,6/12/1995 8:59
163,163, They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it,4/20/1998 3:50
163,1457," I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.",8/15/1972 3:43
163,163, Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada,2/8/2021 12:31
163,163, I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?,1/1/1978 14:10
163,1457, I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?,3/21/2003 21:54
163,1457, I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?,3/24/2002 10:58
163,1457, Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks?,10/21/2018 1:02
163,163," I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough. ",1/26/1982 20:18
163,163, Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them,4/29/1972 15:33
163,1457," Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. ",11/26/1971 23:47
164,164, Yes that makes sense. Did you know a man in france sold the eiffer tower twice?,1/23/1974 13:49
164,602," That man could probably sell the govt's land in Nevada for us! Well, I've had a swell time chatting!",10/12/1985 18:42
164,602," Same here, have a good one.",10/19/1971 14:51
164,602, Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia's position isn't actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising!,12/25/2004 19:09
164,164, Wow I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did,10/19/2021 3:59
164,164," It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!",7/29/1989 11:53
164,164," That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister",8/15/1987 17:13
164,602," Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!",1/24/1989 13:24
164,602," That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL",8/4/2010 7:15
164,602," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own?",1/30/2022 5:32
165,165," That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it",5/21/1973 2:52
165,636, That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha!,12/29/1970 1:33
165,636, Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France,1/27/1972 2:31
165,636, Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!,7/19/2012 9:04
165,636," No I've never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words",6/6/2016 12:46
165,165, That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me.,4/1/1999 3:43
165,636, Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him,6/20/1987 22:15
165,165," Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three!",11/12/1980 19:53
165,636," Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do",11/29/2003 19:40
165,165," That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he?",4/24/2003 22:06
166,166," Yes absolutely! It's crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man",2/28/2007 8:29
166,1499, Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards!,2/25/2000 8:58
166,1499, Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?,12/23/2000 11:32
166,166," I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!",8/22/2020 16:11
166,166," How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley",6/30/1992 10:34
166,166," I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!",10/23/1973 4:32
166,1499, It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie,11/26/2002 13:07
166,1499," Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later",12/22/1990 6:46
166,1499, I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins,5/5/1975 14:32
166,166," right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office",8/2/2006 16:59
167,290," Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie",2/3/2016 9:46
167,167, Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol,5/15/1977 11:03
167,290, Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too,11/6/1996 10:26
167,290," I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?",3/6/1988 8:46
167,167," I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie",4/6/1992 0:37
167,167," I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!",8/28/1970 12:58
167,167," Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop",5/5/1974 10:07
167,290," sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol",1/31/2013 8:49
167,167, Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office,8/15/1977 9:33
167,167," for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing",6/19/1973 22:47
168,1248," That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office",4/6/1977 0:15
168,168," Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think",9/12/2018 5:38
168,168," Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw",6/10/2012 21:51
168,168," That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!",5/6/1988 18:42
168,168, Have a good one,7/14/1998 4:10
168,168, Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?,1/3/1977 17:19
168,168," Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.",6/26/2004 17:39
168,1248, What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha.,10/8/1973 23:21
168,1248," King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.",11/30/2008 15:09
168,168, You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?,5/28/2022 8:07
169,169," I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.",1/12/1992 2:53
169,169, Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later.,6/17/1986 0:29
169,1776, I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?,6/22/1976 7:17
169,1776, That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one!,5/23/2000 14:53
169,169, I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him. ,1/15/1977 22:16
169,169, That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars?,10/10/2014 14:56
169,169," That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.",2/8/2020 20:54
169,169, I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!,4/14/1989 2:09
169,1776," Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter.",2/11/2017 17:29
169,169," They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.",9/10/2011 1:10
170,345, He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors.,12/2/1988 13:29
170,170, Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever.,4/12/1980 3:00
170,345, I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised.,8/6/1993 18:13
170,170," I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!",11/10/2017 7:49
170,345, I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet.,5/14/2020 9:23
170,170, I am going to google that now. Have a good day!,2/7/2008 23:20
170,345, Are you a soccer or tennis fan?,1/28/1997 9:16
170,170," Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team?",5/15/2002 20:22
170,170," No, what was that?",2/26/2018 20:15
170,345," Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year",7/26/2013 14:43
171,171, I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy,1/20/2017 10:46
171,171," Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous",5/5/1998 21:33
171,1887, That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol,12/8/2002 4:01
171,1887, I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined,10/6/1974 15:39
171,1887," Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime! ",3/28/1993 0:03
171,171," That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?",5/5/1983 10:48
171,1887," I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?",2/8/1992 22:30
171,171, No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events,8/20/2005 8:35
171,1887," it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil",3/8/1976 10:07
171,171," Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories",8/12/1970 0:27
172,1259," so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil",6/21/2002 6:50
172,172," That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL",2/1/1994 7:35
172,172," lol, that is a valid point but don't you think they could use turf? That is a little wrong i think ",4/11/1998 13:50
172,172," Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?",4/22/1976 2:51
172,172, I didn't what was that?,4/12/1981 12:38
172,1259," I was asking about the longest point in pro tennis, apparently it lasted for 29 minute straight, it was a 600 shot rally, that's incredible",12/10/2004 8:56
172,172," Wow, great chatting with you!",5/6/2019 22:34
172,1259, Hello,3/2/2004 17:46
172,1259, Hi. Do you play tennis?,7/23/2017 11:10
172,1259, I used to and love it.  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene the crocodile lacoste and only later adopted by polo players,12/18/1981 7:14
173,173, I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic,7/24/2016 6:00
173,173," Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open",7/5/1976 7:08
173,173, I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink,4/12/1973 9:11
173,173," Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.",5/4/1993 6:38
173,274, Do you know who played in that match?,12/21/1988 12:25
173,173," No, I sure don't.  I bet they were worn out though.",6/4/2019 2:20
173,274, Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players,8/30/1990 10:46
173,274," Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25",11/25/1982 15:38
173,274, That is a little late isn't it or do Canadians graduate at a later age?,5/29/2014 6:32
173,274," Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song hotline bling is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit why we can't live together.",9/28/2022 5:01
174,174, I absolutely love his music!,6/14/2006 6:39
174,1625," During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an Obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books  Charlotte's web' and  Winnie the pooh'.",3/13/1995 7:11
174,1625, I wonder why he would do that. He doesn't seem like he is into reading seeing as though he graduated high school so late,9/8/2018 22:42
174,174," Good question.  After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.",7/24/2003 21:44
174,1625, Didn't Drake do some acting when he was younger?,1/14/2020 22:52
174,174, Yes.  Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s.,4/21/2016 16:51
174,1625," They named a college after him too, didn't they?",9/17/2002 15:35
174,174, I'm not sure about that.,9/2/2018 22:03
174,174, I'm gonna go listen to his album on YouTube now. ,9/21/1971 15:07
174,174," Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.",5/29/1978 21:02
175,175," Hello, I'm doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?",2/2/1985 3:19
175,175, Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.,1/19/2021 12:38
175,1226," I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.",12/29/2007 19:32
175,1226, Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football,1/4/1996 5:48
175,1226, I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.,4/9/2003 6:10
175,1226, Seems like a huge expense lol,6/12/2014 12:55
175,1226," I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?",9/1/1970 21:47
175,1226," Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.",5/14/2008 2:36
175,1226," That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.",11/19/1994 18:47
175,175," Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school. ",5/2/1977 14:42
176,182," Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.",5/12/1982 22:27
176,176," Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive. ",10/25/1985 1:40
176,176," Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it.",1/4/1986 4:54
176,176, I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?,2/21/1995 9:29
176,176," I'm not sure, as I've never watched it, even though it was on for seven years.",10/20/2022 9:49
176,182, The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.,11/19/1984 14:59
176,176," That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.",6/22/1985 2:53
176,182," Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money",6/17/1988 18:59
176,176," I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.",7/8/2010 23:25
176,176," me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you ",6/20/2004 1:04

177,177," I have tried to play a few times, but that game is pretty tough.  Did you know you could use any object as a racket until 1978?  Wonder if anyone ever used anything strange. ",1/13/2005 6:29
177,177, Probably but not in serious competitions. A tennis player actually invented the polo! Who knew!,4/19/2013 16:48
177,177," Lol, that is pretty funny, and now they have the polo players on there, I bet the company wants people to think they invented them. ",9/23/1972 5:06

178,1288," Yeah, the US open. Seems like they should have been more prepared.",10/17/2020 2:01
178,178," Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea. ",8/3/2021 19:16
178,178, Agreed. I work in recreation facilities and would not have thought of calling in a helicopter for any of my isssues.,1/28/1979 14:46
178,1288, Right same here (if i did work in that area).  Do you know what the longest rally was in tennis history?,4/28/1996 23:45
178,1288, I have no idea. How long?,11/1/2008 20:56
178,178," It was a 643 shot rally that went on for almost 30 minutes!  That is insane, those people must have been tired after that one lol. ",11/1/1972 8:48

179,179, No. I wish that I did,3/12/1985 5:49
179,179," Same here. Whenever i watch people, it looks so easy to pick up and learn... until you actually try to learn and realize its alot harder than it looks hah. Taking the time to build up muscles in your fingers is hard work.",8/10/2010 13:41
180,180, Its a great musical instrument,7/11/1996 22:20
180,687, This is true. That statement also goes well with piano's. There's so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude? That must be a super lucky piano.,4/18/1974 3:24
180,180, Yes. That piano must be worth a bit of money,12/29/1999 5:20
180,687, I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano. ,2/22/2022 4:29

181,181, The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some!,3/17/1989 8:52
181,1778, It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics,12/31/2015 16:51
181,181, live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising!,10/19/1989 4:17
181,1778," They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun",8/31/1995 20:12
182,485, They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore.,3/28/2021 8:12
182,485," the price is not expensive, $30 to $74",10/8/2001 5:19

182,485, How much do you like jazz,11/11/1998 17:05
182,182," I dig it.    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States",10/7/2019 19:47
182,182," It  is fascinating, comes from ragtime and blues and it is called the Classical music of America",3/28/1983 8:10
182,485," Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, and is more modern.",11/16/1984 11:57
182,182, It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world,7/13/2010 7:14
182,485," It has spread so there is now a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.",10/16/1971 11:05
182,485, Great! I also love the dance-oriented swing big bands like the Kansas city jazz,4/17/1977 18:00
183,183," Many people, even Clint eastwood are lifelong jazz enthusiasts, and scored several films, including million dollar baby",12/3/1991 13:31

183,183, Hello - I did not know that. Do you like jazz music?,9/11/1984 12:01
183,183," It began in the early 1900's there and became really popular in the 1920's. I like all styles of music actually.  Rock music, pop music, country, I like it all. ",2/11/1979 3:52
183,240, That's pretty cool. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees to provide comfort while playing.,7/5/2010 14:13
183,240, That's interesting to know!  There's different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz.,3/13/1987 3:33

184,184, Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there.,4/17/1990 20:48
184,184, I bet so too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra.,11/20/2021 17:18
184,184, Interesting.  I don't think of jazz when I think of Pakistan. ,11/29/2017 20:33
184,184, Me either lol. Eddie Van Halen set his studio speakers on fire when he recorded the guitar solo for beat it.,12/19/1983 12:37
184,1505, Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks.,12/1/1991 10:41
184,184, That's cool I've heard of people using coins before.,12/4/1990 1:34
184,1505, It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you're strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick.,3/5/2011 13:55
184,184, I bet you're right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics.,12/18/1999 9:52
184,1505, Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff.,10/29/2013 9:01
185,185, That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top.,8/8/1995 23:36
185,1796, I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that's light compared to a regular piano.,9/22/2006 16:42
185,185, Wow that's much lighter compared to a regular one.,11/15/2017 2:13
185,185, Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record Hey Jude.,1/25/1993 16:28

185,185," Yes, I like the piano. I don't know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music.",10/12/1970 8:53
185,185," There is an aluminum grand piano that weight 356 pounds, Im guessing thats pretty light for a piano like that one",9/13/2019 21:00
185,185, True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm.,9/30/2012 2:01
185,185," Probably yeah, theres another cool fact about a piano, a group of climbers find one in the strangest of places",11/11/2015 22:34
186,1134, I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there?,9/16/2014 23:42
186,186," I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there",5/20/2018 10:16
186,1134," A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano",9/24/2014 12:46
186,1134," I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote",5/9/2002 20:53
186,186," Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show",1/29/1988 19:01
186,1134, He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar?,3/18/2012 0:31

186,1134," I like Eddie Van Halen I heard the studio got on fire with one of his solos, so much power in that guitar",4/24/2016 23:11
186,186, He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle. ,7/24/1973 21:34
186,1134," How the level of skill and the determination to become a guitarist, he also has a PHD in astrophysics, really intelligent man",10/31/2005 17:49
187,1184," True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar.",8/7/2000 15:29
187,187, I bet he can he can put that PHD in astrophysics and his mad skills as a guitarist to work I think his one of the greatest of all time,12/26/2019 8:25
187,1184, The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood.,6/20/1986 10:46
187,187," He won the Oscar right, I thought he nailed it, he was great on that movie, that movie made me cry",7/31/2020 17:41
187,187," Great guitar and piano playing too. Anyway, thanks for the chat!",12/27/1998 6:45

188,188, Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude,11/19/1970 8:33

193,959," This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar",6/30/1994 3:08
194,199," WOW! That's clever. I enjoy guitar music. Queen's guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics.",7/7/1972 23:07
194,194, he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart,5/8/1993 13:07
194,199, Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan. ,12/16/1993 14:36
194,199," I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals.",9/23/2012 18:26
194,199, I did not. It's been so long that I honestly can't remember what that sounded like. I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol. ,10/15/2021 2:32
194,199, have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano,3/8/1983 12:56
194,199," I had not heard that but it's actually quite touching that he could find a way. Speaking of piano, Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude.",7/24/2021 0:24
194,194, thats interesting ,11/28/1977 1:48
194,194, I thought so. I can't play piano but I enjoy the sound. If I had the room a player piano would be nice. ,1/28/1998 12:33
194,199, I like pianos I would like to learn how play one. they used to have steam piano and they were audible for miles,12/29/1984 18:19
195,195, That must have been extremely loud up close. ,12/4/2007 7:38
195,613," Hi, how are doing over there on this fine evening?",5/23/2000 21:36
195,195, I am good thanks. How are you?,2/18/1976 5:34
195,613, I'm doing groovy over here. Are you a fan of tennis? ,12/21/2003 23:54
195,613, Not so much. I heard that the longest tennis match in history went on for 11 hours. I definitely would not want to watch that.,10/28/2009 15:11
195,613, What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it. ,1/24/2002 2:23
195,613, I think I would be more interested in the helicopter that dried the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,9/20/2018 17:40
195,613, I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution. ,1/30/1975 9:31
195,613," And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced. Probaby grass cut really short but still.",8/27/1970 10:51
195,613," Yeah, there are three kinds of courts. I guess grass has its effect on the ball. Do you use Google much?",3/1/1976 23:40
196,1865," Oh yeah, more than I shoud. I know I'm not the only one. In 2013 Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.",7/23/2021 2:33
196,196," People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.",10/19/2006 5:09
196,1865," Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.",7/17/2017 15:30
196,196, We can't help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid. ,8/17/2011 2:52
196,1865, Google's unofficial slogal is Don't be evil but I sometimes think it is evil. They calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,11/12/2004 19:42
196,196," They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.",11/11/1974 5:26
196,196, And they did hire live goats to mow their lawns once. That is pretty kewl.,11/28/1994 16:16
196,196, I would become a goat there if it got me stock options. ,5/26/2007 21:33
196,1865," Haha. So speaking of Google, I just Googled Borg vs. McEnroe. It is about one of the greatest tennis games ever played. Would you watch it?",1/14/1989 9:15
196,1865, I would watch. I don't think I'd bet on the outcome though. Isn't there some movie about them two?,6/3/1972 0:26
197,197, Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies.,5/4/2006 6:15
197,197, It's probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That's enough personality for one film.,11/12/1972 5:13
197,197," Haha, hilarious. I will have to check it out!",3/22/2011 22:06
197,197, Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?,2/8/1985 4:17
197,252," No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me",5/12/2017 21:21
197,197, I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy.,1/18/2022 13:14
197,252," Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?",11/23/2008 8:43
197,252, I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast.,10/21/1991 2:06
197,197, That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since,10/20/1978 15:09
197,197, Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting.,6/16/1993 5:23
198,198, So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes,6/28/2020 14:26
198,198, lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol,1/30/2005 8:13
198,1146, Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance?,6/30/1988 19:57
198,198, I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I'll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol,10/27/1998 15:50
198,1146," Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn't learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I've done like 100 times)",9/12/2001 5:56
198,198, I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.,7/30/2003 6:56
198,1146," I can't even begin to understand how that makes sense. Then again, I guess computing was done a lot by people by hand back in the 60's",9/10/2019 6:37
198,1146, When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don't remember that.,1/25/2020 10:54
198,1146," I don't remember that either, but it makes sense. Did you know that Google as a company officially prefers dogs over cats?!",5/1/2006 19:20
198,1146, I didn't know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals.,1/26/1977 20:34
199,1901," Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though",11/18/1991 12:00
199,199, I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then.,10/8/1972 15:40
199,1901, I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol,3/17/1994 18:12
199,199, Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!,1/7/2007 11:46
199,1901," Hello, do you follow tennis?",2/1/2014 4:54
199,1901, Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.,9/9/1979 22:36
199,1901, Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?,5/7/2013 8:04
199,199, I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene the crocodile lacoste who was a famous player.,12/5/2007 22:31
199,199, Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,5/25/1979 11:37
199,1901, Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.,7/8/2000 4:04
200,200, I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.,12/3/1987 0:47
200,200," Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!",2/2/1983 3:06
200,1710, That's crazy long! ,2/1/2022 3:09
200,200, I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?,8/5/1985 11:00
200,1710, That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,12/2/1983 10:39
200,200, I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.,8/16/1988 16:42
200,1710, That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.,5/18/2012 13:28
200,1710, I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998.,1/3/2011 6:06
200,1710," I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.",11/30/2006 4:53
200,200, That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome.,4/14/2000 2:00
201,1635, I can't either. Do you like shoes?,10/13/1977 15:30
201,201, I love shoes!! I know that shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today's shoes!,2/7/2006 9:27
201,201, That's pretty amazing they perform better than the shoes of today!,11/22/1993 8:49
201,1635, I agree. I can't see how though. I find it amazing the array of choices like ones that can cost thousands of dollars a pair.,7/11/1987 21:05
201,201, It was good chatting with you!,1/11/2006 4:29
201,1635, Hello do you like tennis?,6/1/2002 16:06
201,1635, Yes. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or doubles.,7/7/2011 23:36
201,201," Yes,  thanks for the explaination.  Did you know that polo shirts were made originally for tennis players?",10/22/2006 23:31
201,201," Yes, It is more comfortable to wear while playing, and it also make the popular of the shirts.",3/16/2001 7:03
201,201, They used a helicopter to dry the grass in the 1969 us open lol,10/10/2020 12:32
202,202," In 19th century, modern tennis is originated in England as Lawn tennis.",1/13/2022 20:38
202,1123," Nice,  sounds fun!  The longest tennis match went on for 3 days!  can you imagine?",1/9/2010 19:15
202,202, When this match happened ?,7/25/2011 1:17
202,202, I think around 2015,11/16/1999 13:01
202,202, Thanks. The main component of tennis is racket until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use absolutely any object as racket.,5/23/2009 15:06
202,1123, Thats interesting!  ,8/6/2002 12:08
202,1123, Google was founded in 1998. It is an American multinational technology company that is specialized in internet-related services.,2/4/2015 5:33
202,202, Seems like a long time ago even though it wasnt.  ,7/22/2011 2:01
202,1123," It is the biggest search engine and cloud computing service. It also many application like gmail, youtube, etc...",12/28/2001 7:36
202,1123," Yes,  I recently read that a google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon lol",11/4/1982 3:44
203,900, Google is the most valuable brand in 2017. Google announced the new company called Calico.,10/29/2022 13:03
203,900," wow awesome.  Instead of hiring people to mow the lawn,  they hired goats.  ",2/4/1994 21:48
203,900, The company moved to mobile android system the Chrome OS is the light weight operating system.,11/24/1999 15:24
203,900, ok.  I recently read that they calculate the taffic by how fast android phones are moving. ,11/4/1992 8:51
203,203, It is very interesting thing. Technology are used to identify were are we. It affect the privacy of person.,6/16/1982 21:54
203,203, I agree.  Its been good chatting. ,3/17/1975 21:14
203,203, Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport.,12/5/2012 9:00
203,203," I've played it a couple time in high school gym class, I wasn't that good",6/6/2013 4:24
203,900, i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams,4/5/2003 20:31
203,203, I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing,6/23/1993 13:05
204,1845, yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene the crocodile lacoste. i love their colgne for men,5/13/1995 22:42
204,204," Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours",10/5/1971 19:51
204,1845, yeah if i recall it went over three days or so,6/6/1996 7:59
204,204," That's a long time, I don't think I've ever done anything for 3 days straight",9/13/2000 0:16
204,204, im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the roger federer of paddle tennis after learning how to play just days earlier.,5/27/2009 9:25
204,1845," Man that's crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts",5/28/1997 21:55
204,204, yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd?,6/7/2009 22:41
204,204," I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold",3/11/2002 23:11
204,204," yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol",6/22/1987 9:11
204,1845," lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th",1/17/1976 18:51
205,1604, i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins,11/24/2009 13:59
205,205," I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe",7/1/2006 9:57
205,205," not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis",6/16/1982 17:02
205,1604, I never knew she was ever ranked that low,11/3/1974 23:57
205,1604," well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen",8/10/1993 13:43
205,205," Wow, shes so good though, she won a grand slam while pregnant",9/9/1974 12:49
205,1604, I guess in my opinion her and her sister are kinda overated.,3/7/1996 4:24
205,205," I don't know, maybe",7/23/1979 15:52
205,205, Have you heard of the new First Man film starring Ryan Gosling?,5/10/2013 5:27
205,205," No, I have not.  Please tell me about it.",1/6/2004 4:49
206,206, It's a space movie.  He plays the character of Neil Armstrong.  It was released Friday.,7/19/1975 19:38
206,860, Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie?,8/25/2021 5:40
206,860, I haven't seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it.,7/30/1988 15:48
206,206, It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic?,9/5/1981 13:08
206,206, Let's talk about Earth.  It's the third planet from the sun.  ,11/22/1984 11:07
206,206," Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.  It's depressing to me.",8/29/1970 21:43
206,860, That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too.,1/8/1982 6:49
206,206," When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  ",11/3/2022 6:00
206,206, Wow.  I didn't know that.  71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions?,10/2/2021 3:42
206,206," Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.",1/10/1980 2:54
207,958, Yes.  Ice is right.  It's almost like the history of the earth is like watching a science fiction movie only in real life.,6/15/1989 12:10
207,207," I like science fiction.  I like to imagine things, like aliens in a different planet.",12/25/1989 6:08
207,207, Do you like Starship Troopers?  ,3/4/2020 1:17
207,207," Yes, because it is the only science fiction novel recommended by three branches of the military.  I wonder why they recommended it though - do you know?",5/5/2017 6:10
207,958, I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies. ,7/14/2006 19:43
207,207," By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us?",5/8/1989 21:25
207,207," That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! ",6/14/1976 12:54
207,958, Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise. ,8/5/2007 0:26
207,207, Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we're they wrong.,4/24/1994 21:43
207,958, They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee.,9/20/1996 0:52
208,208," James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice.",6/6/1991 13:36
208,208, I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think?,12/25/1970 8:58
208,920, I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?  ,8/31/1983 0:00
208,208, They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars.,1/3/1989 14:17
208,208, You would think!  He's a billionaire from the movie!,10/29/1978 6:23
208,920, Rich people are often cheap.,8/18/1973 19:03
208,920, That's sad...but so true.  I've seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on.,7/25/2011 10:15
208,920," I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.",2/6/2007 10:01
208,208, Dogs or cats?,3/18/1996 18:12
208,920," Hi! I have two cats, but want a dog. You?",8/7/2019 15:01
209,1337," I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though",9/9/1980 11:22
209,1337, Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company. ,10/14/2010 22:58
209,1337," lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!",5/13/2002 16:35
209,209, Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays.,4/22/2018 17:15
209,209," that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country",11/8/2018 15:37
209,1337, I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines?,1/29/2003 23:50
209,209," right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood?",10/17/2007 16:33
209,1337, Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too!,12/4/1998 3:22
209,1337," that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats",9/8/1973 8:20
209,209," My cats responding to pointing, and throwing.",6/19/1993 1:15
210,210," That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don't know about lol. Do you like horses at all?",9/5/1975 23:05
210,210, I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?,11/16/2007 21:33
210,210," They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn't ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast.",8/6/1973 14:13
210,1981, I wonder if riders trained horses to do that?,1/12/2020 19:38
210,210, I am sure they did. I just wouldn't ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless,5/25/2010 8:47
210,1981, That's funny and rather stupid at the same time.,6/16/1991 19:04
210,210," For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!",11/11/1991 2:20
210,210," My cats will run away, but sure!",12/8/2021 3:33
210,210, lol! bye now!,12/27/1983 9:19
210,210, Crazy that early humans used to have to battle giant sloths! Who would've thought?,6/9/1986 23:35
211,211," I know right! Humans have been around for a long time apparently I mean we lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!",10/5/1975 5:55
211,211," Yea that's really interesting. I never knew humans could regrow a rib bone that has been surgically shortened, either.",9/29/1981 13:28
211,1332, No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha,11/30/2021 16:29
211,211, That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to.,4/19/2001 19:38
211,1332, That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it,12/9/1992 6:34
211,1332, Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers!,7/9/1988 3:36
211,211," Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL?",11/6/2004 8:37
211,1332," No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further. ",4/23/1973 17:52
211,211, Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way?,5/11/2004 10:37
211,211," I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha",5/15/2005 5:16
212,212, Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time,6/9/2012 5:55
212,212," That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig.",12/30/2010 1:42
212,1548, It does sound awesome! I don't know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way,9/28/1979 15:48
212,212, Right? Haha And yea I've seen the Godfather but it's been a while.,5/4/1975 15:51
212,1548," Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don't know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently",5/8/1993 5:29
212,1548," Yea, I vaguely remember, that's awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized!",11/17/2007 18:02
212,1548, That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL,6/29/2018 15:28
212,212," Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!",3/6/2005 6:40
212,1548, The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL,9/30/2022 17:35
212,1548, Haha that is insane. How does anyone even figure out that there's that many animals?! Interesting that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead. I wonder what that's about?,1/31/2000 10:51
213,344," I know right. like will a fish get a patch of white on its forehead?the only animals that have that that I've ever seen our dogs, so I just don't know LOL",4/23/2006 1:14
213,344," Hi, Do you like to cook?",9/14/2007 7:53
213,213, I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot.,6/12/1990 8:22
213,213," Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot.",3/10/1989 19:35
213,344, Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.,8/13/1978 0:37
213,344," Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all.",1/27/1974 22:59
213,213, That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave.,7/16/1991 2:34
213,344," The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans.",5/15/2015 13:50
213,213, We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.,5/11/2022 4:52
213,344," Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat.",10/9/1998 12:54
214,1521, I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.,12/26/1980 14:18
214,214," Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?",12/16/1979 8:53
214,214, I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old,2/2/2002 17:54
214,1521," Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I",11/25/1984 5:14
214,1521, THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years,1/29/2016 1:04
214,1521, Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,5/28/2011 5:22
214,214, Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.,6/9/1989 7:37
214,1521," Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating.",10/25/2016 12:51
214,214, That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?,7/15/1981 8:38
214,1521," There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.",2/10/2003 2:54
215,215, thats neat. They have then thousand living species.,5/3/2012 8:11
215,215," That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about.",11/14/1977 11:14
215,187, o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents.,11/22/1980 21:26
215,187," That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long.",2/8/2020 8:00
215,187, They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly.,2/26/2001 14:38
215,215, This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird. They were actually a sub-family of pigeons.,1/24/2006 16:52
215,187, pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young.,6/5/2009 5:26
215,187, Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds.,5/17/1976 20:39
215,215, Hi do you like tennis?,10/3/2006 6:37
215,215, Oh yeah! I pick up a racket and hit the net when I can!,3/16/2022 22:25
216,1314, Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?,7/28/1983 20:19
216,216," Ha! That's weird! I didn't know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket?",2/2/2000 6:33
216,1314, Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,4/11/1975 21:18
216,1314," Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. ",5/18/1994 9:22
216,1314," Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!",2/8/2007 6:32
216,1314," She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal.",8/11/1987 16:28
216,1314, That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,6/27/1972 14:41
216,216," That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13!",5/18/1987 13:38
216,216, lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.,8/31/2003 15:23
216,1314," That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks! ",3/3/2013 2:22
217,1097, That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!,10/25/1987 19:33
217,217, Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally? ,6/21/2014 0:04
217,1097, Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol,1/29/1993 14:17
217,217," Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!",7/30/1975 12:40
217,1097, lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music?,6/5/2018 12:34
217,217," Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they're both so fast paced. Did you know the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second?",9/26/1989 4:29
217,217, Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you!,8/23/2010 13:03
217,217," Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!",10/25/2000 19:01
217,217, I'll have to look him up!  Have a great night!,1/17/2018 7:43
217,1097, What do you think of Serena Williams?,2/14/1971 0:17
218,218, I really like her! ,6/27/1985 1:18
218,954, Have you seen the Nike ads?,8/23/2022 14:42
218,218, I haven't but I hear they are really powerful messages in this age of people stepping forward about sexual harassment.,3/22/1979 4:55
218,218, It is all about there is no wrong way to be a woman.,5/6/2014 4:54
218,218," Yes, ans inequality among races and gender. I like Serena.",6/19/1978 18:51
218,954, I really think she is a great driving force and a good role model to girls.,12/30/1989 18:04
218,218," Yes, definitely! I agree. She is happy to have such a powerful platform to try and pave the way for upcoming generations. ",10/5/1979 12:05
218,218, Very true.  Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?,2/5/2012 19:38
218,954, That is interesting! Did you know in Tennis years ago you were allowed to use any object as your racket? Haha,4/13/2005 21:51
218,954," Really, like a shoe?",1/26/1974 8:52
219,1363, Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!,12/13/1999 4:35
219,219," Really, there is so much grunting in tennis.  The longest match was 11 hours long over 3 days!",3/20/1972 19:44
219,219," Wow, I could never last that long! Speaking of Serena Williams, I didn't know she went pro at age 13! That is amazing....and she is co owner of the Miami Dolphins...wow!",1/1/1970 7:18
219,219," She co-owns the dolphins and was a pro at 13!  Wow, she is really incredible.",3/19/2001 0:38
219,219, I think she is! Speaking of amazing...imagine this...the worlds fastest rapper can rap 14.1 syllables per second! ,11/12/2002 22:18
219,1363," That is crazy, can anyone even understand that?",9/23/1971 6:22
219,219," I am not sure but I would love to hear it! Talk about funny, McDonald's at one time paid rappers 5 bucks every time they said Big Mac in their songs hahahaa....crazy",11/28/1992 23:03
219,219, I bet they were dropping Big Mac lines like crazy!,3/25/2016 6:52
219,1363," I bet they were too! lol! There is even a rapper who is deaf! he raps in sign language, very interesting!",2/22/1997 11:10
219,1363," Wow, Id like to watch that.  Great Chat!  Have a great night!",9/1/2002 17:10
220,220, hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets,8/31/1994 6:41
220,220, Hi! Hope you're doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse!,7/26/1997 16:17
220,1207, i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens.,9/12/1987 7:52
220,220," Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out!",12/1/2002 14:27
220,1207," i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret.",8/15/1971 5:50
220,220," That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not!",2/26/1980 4:18
220,220, i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure.,9/30/2009 14:17
220,220," Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing!",4/23/1996 3:58
220,220, that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies.,12/20/2013 9:33
220,220," Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!",2/17/1999 4:56
221,221, that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache.,1/28/2005 8:13
221,221," You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made? ",6/15/1973 1:42
221,711, yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science. ,8/21/1975 9:43
221,711, That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him!,7/6/2013 19:29
221,221, i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science. ,4/10/2009 22:28
221,711, True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha!,11/21/1998 1:52
221,221, he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him ,5/8/1972 21:16
221,711," Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!",10/6/1994 13:28
221,711," Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!",8/21/1984 9:00
221,221, Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!,6/18/1995 5:16
222,738, he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one!,3/11/2008 20:01
222,738," So true. And speaking of Eminem, it's hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care!",4/25/2008 6:34
222,222, You too! have a good night!,2/3/2018 2:13
222,222, You have a good evening as well. I'm off to watch the Rugrats movie to see if I recognize Busta Rhymes' voice in it as the Reptar wagon. Ha! Take care!,6/7/1980 10:14
222,222, Disney Land & World released officlal Mickey Mouse ears - rainbow colors - for Pride Month recently. Disney??? When did they wake upd & get tolerant??,9/6/2016 0:02
222,738," Yeah that is interesting. I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too",9/28/2017 3:30
222,738, About Pride Month or something else?,5/20/1994 14:00
222,738," I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure",4/8/1979 16:51
222,738," Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to reconsider",7/27/1983 22:05
222,222," Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva LOL",10/5/1992 9:19
223,223," Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film?",7/9/2001 17:04
223,330," I really like The Little Mermaid and I also like The Lion King, what about you? I don't really like Wall-e myself",6/13/2021 5:50
223,330," Lion King was a fav of mine. Loved James Earl Jones, who voiced the father lion character. Little Mermaid had some great music like Under the Sea. Disney is a huge studio today",10/27/2013 1:31
223,223," Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer",12/9/2016 13:46
223,330, Haven't seen. Wonder what that computer looks like - Apple makes a lot of computers used by artists & filmmakers.,5/19/1987 4:53
223,223," Yep you're right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him",7/5/2009 15:20
223,330," Agree, but calling Trump a brother went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though.",4/30/1983 18:40
223,223," Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease",1/2/2015 0:11
223,223," Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel.",6/19/2002 10:54
223,330," Yes that's a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues",6/22/1987 9:44
224,1147," Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap?",1/22/2016 5:31
224,224," Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually",8/3/1990 18:33
224,1147, 'bout time. Some folks say Rap/hip-hop definitely has West African roots - and is based on religious worship. ,8/12/1987 0:20
224,224," Yeah I can see that. I would like to see a compliment battle actually, those are really popular in Korea, I think it's a much more positive thing than a diss battle that I usually see",12/1/1975 16:14
224,224," Great idea. Some rap lyrics don't seem to have anything to do w/praise, do they?",5/10/2014 13:00

225,225," Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.",7/28/1991 18:20
225,920, I bet that frequency is used a lot in horror films.,9/5/2003 1:01

227,1493, pretty recent. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?,5/27/1986 6:41

229,1349," I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender.",8/20/2021 4:41
229,229, I didn't know she did that.  She speaks fluent French and Italian.,6/25/1994 11:32
229,229," She's great. There is a rapper who is deaf, and rhymes in sign language.",9/17/1990 23:01
229,1349, That is interesting.  Tupac Shakur's music is in the library of congress of cultural significance,9/14/1978 3:10
229,229, Did you know that Serena Williams co-owns the Miami Dolphins?,1/3/1983 15:11
229,1349, I didn't know that.  In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world.,6/28/1979 0:38
229,229, It's hilarious that McDonalds pays rappers $5 for each time they mention big macs in songs. I'm surprised one hasn't just said big mac' the entire time.,5/11/1977 15:40
229,1349, lol true!  Big Mac sounds like it would be a good rapper name.  Eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist before he was a rapper.,4/18/2000 12:53
229,229," Donald Glover's name came from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. I would have loved to have seen how many he rejected, before settling on Childish Gambino.",6/29/1997 19:25
229,1349, I know right?  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called compliment battle  Never heard of that before.,6/28/1972 19:03
230,1057," It's fascinating to know that the term hip hop comes from the 16th century, and means to converse.",6/14/2020 14:54
230,230, I didn't know that.  In 2001 a Michigan judge delivered a ruling in the form of a rap when judging over a suit filed against Eminem.  I bet that was funny to hear in the court room.,2/27/1979 2:04
230,230, That is funny. It is asinine that grunting can be considered cheating in tennis. How insane is that?,5/11/1973 16:22
230,230, I agree.  It's always so quiet during tennis matches.,1/29/2012 6:17
230,1057, I would have liked to have seen the matches when they were permitted to use anything as a racket. I think they ended that in the 70's.,12/21/1993 15:14
230,1057, That would have been interesting.  Polo shirts were originally invented bor tennis and later adopted for polo players.,2/14/1983 18:12
230,230," I just admire Serena for speaking up for women's rights, even though it comes at a great personal cost to her. She truly is a warrior for women.",2/20/2001 11:03
230,1057, I agree.  In 1998 she shaid that both she and her sister Venus could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.  ,6/5/1997 21:33
230,1057, I have zero ideas how rankings work in tennis. I think it is appalling for a little girl to be told she was too black for tennis whites. That is the epitome of racism right there.,5/29/1985 12:44
230,230, You know it!  ,12/9/1992 19:23

231,1907, Wall e was given that name to remember walter disney,5/18/2004 11:11
231,231," How adorable. I never knew that. We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby. ",7/15/1989 12:52
231,1907, yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production,3/21/1999 9:28
231,231," Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist. ",7/31/1978 0:59
231,1907, for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team,10/19/2001 12:40
231,1907," Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves.",2/13/1985 22:52
231,231, bold moves  may be a  album with Kanye west would be boldest and unimaginable,10/25/1994 16:50
231,1907," Oh boy, yeah. Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh?",11/14/2018 19:31
232,1974, really ? I think something is wrong with that man,11/24/1994 21:22
232,1974," Yeah, odd thinking. He also did a skit about interrupting on awards show 2 years prior to really doing it. The skit was on SNL and he was mocking himself.  ",12/8/2020 19:25
232,232, still could not to resist to do it with taylor . Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu,5/13/2011 15:21
232,1974," Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually.",11/13/1981 9:14
232,232, pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows,11/29/2002 10:14
232,232, Thats some sound advice! His Gold Digger song was really fun to listen to but thats about it.,9/17/1979 10:58
232,1974, Do you know that eminem's dream is to become a comic book artist,4/28/2018 15:00
232,1974," No way, really? I like him but never knew that. I heard that Tupac has music in the library of congress as cultural significance,. That is pretty cool, I think.",5/25/1998 13:59
232,1974, Once a judge gave her ruling in form of Rap where eminem is charged ,5/15/1979 14:11
232,1974," HA, thats pretty clever! I guess that Eminem had a favorite character and it was Spiderman. Good thing he stayed with music and rapping.",7/11/1995 13:33
233,1366, good chatting with you,4/11/2012 13:02

233,1366, Lion King rocks! I think they are making a new one really soon. I liked Beauty and the Beast and even Moana was great,2/8/1983 0:22
233,233, I really enjoyed the soundtrack of Moana. Beauty and the Beast also had a pretty good one.,1/14/2009 18:46
233,233, For sure! Did you ever watch Big Hero 6?,9/4/1993 2:18
233,1366," I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you?",7/31/1972 6:46
233,233," I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer",3/11/1971 22:27
233,233, Talk about high tech! Bill Nye was a scientist consultant for Disney's flubber!,11/26/1987 13:52
233,233," no way! That is awesome, I never knew that. lol. Bill Nye is the man!",8/7/1986 17:12
234,1368, Pixar also named wall-e after walter elais disney.,4/16/2003 5:58
234,234," that is a nice shout out to walter disney. I like the other shout outs too, there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in disney things",10/25/2011 2:37
234,1368," Speaking of mickey mouse, Minnie mouse was short for Minerva mouse.",3/10/1972 0:47
234,234," no way, all these short names, I never knew that! I wonder where the name Minerva went",4/21/2010 13:45
234,234, Do you listen to rap music?,3/3/1983 20:21
234,1368," I used to love listening to Rap music, not so much anymore, but still enjoy it. How about you?",12/9/1982 6:58
234,1368, I do not listen to them too much as I prefer other types of music.,7/5/1985 19:33
234,234," I like Korean Rap, they have compliment rap battles lol",12/13/1981 16:20
234,1368," Ah, the infamous k-pop. I have listened to some of that here and there.",7/6/2020 23:47
234,234," Me too, even North Korea has a form of kpop. It was so nice chatting with you!",4/2/1981 8:20
235,1743, It was nice chatting with you too! Thank you for you time!,2/13/1979 13:18
235,235," Thank you also, enjoy your night!",3/23/1999 10:41
235,235, Hello. Do you like the Star Wars movies?,7/28/1984 16:51
235,235, I love them! some of my favorites. how about you?,1/4/1998 22:50
235,235, I love them too.  I've even read some of the books and played a few star wars video games.,5/8/2008 12:14
235,235, oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great,2/17/1983 4:41
235,235," Some of the older ones. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks.",2/11/1996 8:27
235,235, oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s,10/10/2015 5:46
235,1743," I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award.",6/18/1986 22:27
235,235, she did?? what for?,10/18/1988 16:25
236,1844," She did some editing work on some scenes.  She worked on obi wan's death, leia's good luck kiss, and the trench run.",10/3/1991 17:22
236,1844, thats awesome. Did you know Ewan McGregors brother goes by Obi-Two?,8/19/2008 2:03
236,236," No I didn't but that's neat!  I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?",10/5/1976 15:40
236,1844," I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome",9/30/2022 3:04
236,236," Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he'd make a lot more if he were doing that today.",11/21/1980 23:01
236,236, he probably would make no less than 100k a day! that voice is so iconic,3/13/2009 6:18
236,236, It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn't do him or Vader justice in my opinion.,12/3/1981 15:26
236,1844, you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil,12/31/1976 18:35
236,236," Okay, I got my new movies mixed up. I liked kylo ren too. What I didn't like is seeing Hans Solo die if that's the right movie. The one  I meant about vadar was the new movie about a young darth vadar.",6/3/1998 17:32
236,236, oh yea Han died in Force Awakens. did you know Star Wars is technically responsible for Titanic and Avatar existing?,6/19/1991 14:27
237,237, No I didn't. How is that?,8/6/2007 11:19
237,237," James Cameron decided to join the film industry after watching star wars, he drected those 2 films",5/6/1974 13:34
237,106, I guess Star Wars is inspiring in more ways than one!,10/22/1995 10:54
237,237, Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It's amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon,7/1/2007 2:14
237,237," Oh, really? That is really interesting.",11/20/2006 18:12
237,106," It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think",12/28/1987 20:35
237,106," I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long!",6/8/2018 6:32
237,106, I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future,2/13/2015 3:43
237,106," I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!",11/11/1977 0:33
237,237," What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet",1/24/1987 22:56
238,1936," It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?",11/27/2019 9:53
238,238," That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do",9/27/1974 7:22
238,238," It's very scary to think about, hopefully we don't.",3/26/2020 19:33
238,1936," What other interesting fact, is that if all of history was 24 hours, humans would only take up about 1 minute worth of the 24 hours, isn't that wild to think about?",7/25/2005 0:47
238,1936, It's very interesting. It's amazing how long the earth has sustained life.,8/12/1996 1:06
238,238, Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.,1/14/2007 20:34
238,238," Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?",9/16/1993 2:06
238,238, I know right! I always wanted to go treasure hunting and get some gold from like sunken ships or something haha. Do you like science fiction by the way?,5/11/2016 13:14
238,238, I think it's great to learn about. ,8/28/1990 17:27
238,238," Yes I think it's interesting, one cool thing to is that NASA has a list of space technology words that writers can use so that they are making accurate statements in the movie",3/23/1999 23:59
239,239, That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military.,8/31/2011 1:11
239,239," Yep you're right! Have you seen the movie? The movie is really violent but I liked it, it's from the director of Robocop. I can't believe it's on the military reading list though",9/16/2005 6:13
239,239," Yeah me either! A judge in 1950's tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character! ",9/30/1981 6:54
239,192," Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term robotic was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha",1/30/1994 6:06
239,192," I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)",5/10/2020 6:47
239,192," Hi, how are you?",12/21/2020 3:18
239,239," Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he's from Guatemala and that's where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy?",2/11/2018 0:21
239,239, I did not know that! I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas's wife won an emmy while he did not.,8/24/2018 13:54
239,192," Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. ",10/25/1970 22:01
239,192, I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?,5/4/1989 8:08
240,240," You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain. ",5/12/1989 16:58
240,240, Yeah! That does work out to a great hourly rate though. The total value of the star wars franchise is $65B!,1/6/1978 1:13
240,240," And that's after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made!",11/7/2003 7:58
240,1661, Yeah! Do you know what he sold to Disney for? How much???,9/15/1974 16:48
240,1661," Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas's wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan's death. ",3/28/2022 8:23
240,240, I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss...,11/29/1978 21:47
240,240, And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar. ,5/20/1991 15:23
240,240," I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise.",7/12/2010 15:03
240,240, Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day. ,11/27/2009 20:46
240,1661, I did like that one. I thought that had a good story and nice acting. There's a reason why they are the most successful film merchandising franchise!,7/1/1996 19:07
241,241, Definitely. I also like the diversity of the films. Did you know in the 1950's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because one of the characters was black? Crazy. ,10/4/1973 14:54
241,934, Very unfair. Isn't (s)he supposed to be just? Weighing the decisions of the land so that everyone is treated fairly?,7/2/1987 20:57
241,241," The 50's were a different time, unfortunately. One of the first sci-fi stories is thought to be from ancient Greece, over 1800 years ago, about plant-based aliens living on the moon.",4/25/2012 5:58
241,934, Who thinks of these stories? I guess it is more of a commentary on my lack of creativity.,5/24/2019 23:46
241,934, Haha. Isaac Asimov coined the term Robots in 1941. I'd have thought it was much older than that. ,1/15/2019 9:41
241,934, Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!,9/11/2010 23:27
241,934," hi, did you watch the movie titanic?",2/4/1999 22:51
241,241," Yes, I watched the movie several times and for me it was touching.",4/8/1989 11:25
241,241, Yes it always is. did you know the founder of Hershey was going to be in the ship but had to cancel due to work,5/11/2003 12:35
241,934," No, I didn't know that, are you aware if or not the titanic was found in real life?",11/23/1985 1:03
242,1603, Yeah and there are even picture of the iceberg that sunk the titanic,1/10/1983 19:27
242,1603," Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actor, do you have a favorite actor?",10/22/2002 23:57
242,1603, I do not think I have a favorite one but he was soo good in the titanic,3/14/2014 19:21
242,1603," If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list?",8/29/2005 6:53
242,242, travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you?,4/9/2016 15:04
242,1603," About the same travel the world, visit places that I have never visit before, no matter how far.",4/10/1993 19:55
242,242, yeah that would be incredible. d o you like dogs?,4/23/1996 22:25
242,1603," Yes, I like dogs, I have a german shepard, but I also will like to have a husky if I live in the mountains.",11/16/2015 5:13
242,1603, That is really nice. they can have one of the 12 types of blood,3/3/1989 10:54
242,1603," Do you have a dog, If yes what breed of dog and his name?",12/9/1988 19:23
243,243, I do not unfortunately for now. Maybe later. Dogs can also donate blood that is so cool,2/5/2010 11:04
243,1164," Wow, that is cool, do you know any of your personal friend's dog that donated blood?",8/6/1999 13:23
243,243," No, none that I know. In Istanbul they have vendin machines that dispense food and water for dogs",1/23/2007 17:10
243,243," Ok, do you like horse, If you do, have you rode a horse before?",9/20/2016 22:44
243,243, I have ridden a horse before and they are my favorite animals. How about you?,12/26/1983 13:22
243,1164," Yes, I rod a once, I was raised on a farm and all my friends had a horse except me.",10/6/1977 0:35
243,243, THey are such gentle creatures. Nice chatting with you.,3/10/1983 8:55
243,243, Do you watch the Red Sox? ,9/22/1992 6:39
243,243," I do, what do you think about Prices injury?",11/15/1990 23:55
243,1164," It sucks that he is injured, a friend of mine had the same problem from typing on the computer.",2/3/2010 5:05
244,244," Yeah I guess carpal tunnel is a pretty common injury, it seems like his problem is related to gaming",6/5/1998 2:53
244,244," Yeah, I guess that is better than Tommy John problems. ",10/14/1987 14:04
244,1262," Well the team manager must be really mad, after all David is one of the key pieces of the team, he said his been playing for a while now, since he was 12 so I wonder if playing games is really the cause",10/1/1977 10:26
244,244," Yeah, he is a great player. Did you know video games were orignally used by the military? ",7/10/2014 8:42
244,1262," No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently",6/8/1994 16:52
244,1262," I know, it was probably for some type of war game. ",7/31/1971 20:47
244,1262, What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ?,7/16/1977 1:48
244,1262, I play them every now and then. LOL,7/23/2011 10:31
244,1262," I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?",2/6/1974 17:37
244,244," No, I used to though. I didn't like the games that were coming out on it. ",6/5/1975 12:06
245,245," I see well I bought one and used to play fifa 14, that was the last game that came our for the PlayStation 2 model.",2/8/1997 0:51
245,245, I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games? ,3/11/1998 3:57
245,1592," I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games",10/14/1985 8:34
245,245," Yeah, I heard that. Apparently playstation 3s are being used to research blackholes. ",12/4/2017 21:35
245,1592," Wow it sounds like the consol has a lot of power, it must be cheaper than building a computer capable of doing that, the department of defense also used them to build a supercomputer, in fact 1760 units",1/5/2017 22:58
245,1592," yeah, apparently they used them to build a super computer, I wonder if they were actually playing grand theft auto!",11/11/2017 16:32
245,1592," I dont about that but something funny happened to the company, they issued and unlock code for the ps3 by accident, they were prosecuting people that did the same things before them.",12/28/1971 8:16
245,245," Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?",2/7/2021 3:29
245,245," I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?",10/30/2005 12:23
245,245," Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger. ",3/13/1994 11:27
246,246, Hello! How are you today?,5/17/2014 7:17
246,246," Hello, I'm great thanks for asking. Do you like video games?",7/31/2018 5:52
246,1835," I do! I've been playing for over 20 years now, how about you?",1/27/2006 5:48
246,246, I have been playing for about 25 years now. I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices.,7/16/1975 9:03
246,1835, Say that ten times fast haha. Did you know it is illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight?,4/28/2014 7:55
246,246," Haha. I did not know that, but maybe that's a good idea. ",8/7/1987 15:21
246,246, I agree. Do you have a playstation or xbox?,6/24/2005 21:44
246,1835, I have a PS4. What about you?,12/21/2014 14:50
246,246, I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out?,6/9/1984 22:59
246,246, I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation.,9/16/1990 12:49
247,247, I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it's cool the military uses playstation 3's to build a supercomputer.,1/2/2002 6:40
247,895, That is very cool. They are super powerful devices so it makes sense to me.,1/31/1995 13:10
247,895, Do you like to watch baseball at all?,12/7/1975 17:42
247,895, I love baseball. What about you?,3/26/2003 6:30
247,247, Same here. I didn't know it was more popular in Japan than it is here!,1/20/1998 12:41
247,895, Me either. It's a huge past time here in America. I'm excited for opening day.,1/31/1978 6:05
247,247, Who do you like to watch?,11/16/1990 14:41
247,247, I love the Cincinnati Reds. What about you?,12/15/1990 16:33
247,247," I'm not a fan of a team but like watching it in general! Anyways, Great chatting with you!",4/13/2013 0:32
247,247, I think the same. It was good talking to you too!,6/29/2018 5:10
248,1431, Have a great day!,7/16/2013 5:57
248,248, Hello. Do you play any video games?,11/27/1985 21:42
248,248, I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series.,9/10/2016 13:25
248,1431, I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?,7/27/2010 8:08
248,1431," Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.  ",5/19/2015 23:47
248,1431, I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well.,6/15/2022 9:10
248,1431," The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4.",12/28/2010 19:32
248,1431, I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes.,3/22/1977 19:11
248,248," Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden.",8/28/1996 21:57
248,1431, Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one?,5/20/1999 23:51
249,1480, I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio.,3/22/1982 18:39
249,1480, THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game.,6/20/2002 17:38
249,1480, Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?,6/3/1997 21:46
249,249, Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it.,5/15/1970 18:53
249,1480," Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL.",12/19/2019 17:49
249,1480, I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed?,2/16/2013 3:04
249,1480," Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out. ",12/30/2000 22:21
249,249, He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball.,6/14/1991 5:00
249,1480, Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.  Perhaps because of video games. He might try kick ball.,6/19/2015 22:26
249,249, Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.,4/16/2001 16:23
250,250, Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life.,10/9/1973 4:48
250,640, It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day. ,9/29/2008 10:04
250,640, Have a good day.,10/15/2020 20:43
250,250, hey there do you watch any shows on Netflix,8/23/1983 1:11
250,640," Yes I have a subscription, been watching The Office.  They have come out with their own originals too called Netflix Original.  What about you?",7/5/1976 20:17
250,250," oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds",7/11/1986 22:20
250,640," Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards.",2/6/2015 4:04
250,640, I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius!,6/22/2020 13:37
250,640, It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts.,7/18/2016 16:33
250,250," ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too!",11/3/1976 18:43
251,135," Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him.",6/8/1972 5:15
251,251," ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July",7/6/1972 16:51
251,251, Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him.,5/22/1998 11:50
251,135," yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha",1/11/1987 17:57
251,135," I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx.",2/14/1991 11:17
251,251," oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens",1/31/1990 4:15
251,251, Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together.,5/14/1997 0:12
251,135," lol, that is a weird movie though, Seinfeld is super rich though, richer than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined apparently ",3/20/1993 2:39
251,251, Well I am just glad I do not have any stock in MoviePass.  It fell to under a dollar after people found out Christopher Robin was not being shown last summer.,1/7/2015 17:58
251,251," oh wow ya I'm glad I didn't get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me",2/9/1974 6:40
252,472," Netflix is piling up debt to fund all these new series and shows, 21.9 billion at last count.  But they have made 125+ shows and series of new content.",4/30/1972 10:15
252,472," ah I didn't know that, they sure take up a lot of bandwidth, about 1/3 of all internet traffic",5/24/1977 12:56
252,472, I bet Blockbuster regrets not buying them for 50 million.  Now they are out of business or pretty close.,12/17/1990 12:20
252,252," ya, with Netflix now worth about 2 billion, that was definitely a mistake!",7/14/1989 13:49
252,472," Hello, are you a big Netflix person?",10/2/1980 5:43
252,472, I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content!,1/27/1978 11:11
252,252, I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?,1/29/1999 23:04
252,252, I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features.,11/30/2003 2:36
252,472," It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over.",9/19/2022 17:01
252,252, Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY!,1/3/2003 20:17
253,253, And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am!,7/26/1976 4:07
253,253," Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!",3/13/1997 4:08
253,253," I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith.",9/26/1975 4:48
253,992, True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content!,12/28/1975 2:11
253,253," That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut.",6/7/1982 9:30
253,253," I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage.",11/5/2004 10:45
253,992," I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences.",11/5/2022 1:05
253,992," Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! ",9/22/2009 6:40
253,253," Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous.",6/23/1996 23:15
253,992, Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact! ,11/26/1973 23:29
254,254," That's a whole lot! They're certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones.",8/7/1988 9:22
254,381," My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April.",1/31/1993 22:50
254,381," Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!",6/1/1986 7:34
254,381, I heard about that! I think that would be awesome - following them like the characters in the show!,8/1/1999 17:47
254,254," Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!",10/10/2018 21:12
254,254," Hello, do you watch Netflix?",12/12/1973 15:49
254,254," Hi there, I do sometimes, but don't have an account myself.  How about you?",4/21/1992 8:04
254,381," I do have an account. Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America?",6/16/1974 4:27
254,381," Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours. ",1/28/2011 2:28
254,254, I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.,6/20/2001 16:21
255,375," That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future. ",9/5/1997 2:44
255,375, Netflix is worth $2 billion right now.,6/26/2009 21:18
255,255," Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer. ",2/8/1992 17:56
255,255, I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings.,1/21/1997 12:35
255,255," Yeah old Reed didn't like those late fees, look what happened since then. ",8/22/1991 16:35
255,255, Do you like Tom Cruise?,8/2/1997 4:08
255,375," Yeah I do, I really like 80's Tom Cruise movies.  How about you?",7/18/1987 23:34
255,255, Me too. I love Top Gun.,12/30/1973 19:06
255,375," Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business. ",9/26/2001 20:10
255,375, Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse who is the inventory of the hoverboard.,10/14/2002 18:09
256,256, I heard that!  I think he should have just endorsed it and gone along with it.,1/9/2002 19:25
256,428, I agree. Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for a film.,3/2/2012 17:12
256,256," That is dedication, I have always admired him for his acting skills. ",2/7/1998 9:26
256,256, Me too. He has a $10 million dollar underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.,4/25/1996 15:03
256,428," That is the weird side of him, I remember when he went kind of nuts on the Ellen show years back. ",2/5/2008 20:22
256,428, It was great chatting.,7/21/2001 23:58
256,428, Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world.,3/17/2021 1:00
256,256, I did know that. I think I saw a movie about that on Netflix actually. Do you have Netflix,8/18/1986 4:13
256,256," Yes, i have Netflix. Netflix was founded in 1997.",7/20/2011 22:10
256,428, Yep it's crazy that they're going to spend it 2 billion dollars this year to make more new content. I do like their shows though,7/19/1995 8:14
257,225, Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc.,5/14/2012 17:00
257,257, Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it,6/10/2015 5:45
257,225, I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970.,1/13/2013 3:14
257,257, I think it was actually in the nineties I think you're thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though,3/14/2009 14:04
257,257, I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great.,6/22/1976 3:13
257,225, Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha,5/25/1983 11:20
257,257, tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind.,7/21/2008 13:11
257,225, It's crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn't really like that movie what did you think,5/16/2018 21:10
257,257, Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language.,4/4/1981 8:40
257,257," Yeah for sure. I also never knew that in the movie, The Last Samurai, Samurai is actually plural and refers to Tom Cruise and the whole clan",9/7/2010 11:06
258,258, I think the movie was released in 2003 and the movie was successfully crossed 45-68 crores usd.,12/28/2000 1:43
258,258," I always think the Tom Cruise is super rich, but Seinfeld has a net worth that is more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined which is insane",6/12/2009 7:42
258,1867, Tom hanks also great actor and his net work is $390 million.,7/31/2003 0:22
258,258, He has a great actor. Tom Cruise is kind of a weird guy though. He spent $10 on a bunker to protect himself from outer space aliens,12/8/1974 12:49
258,258, It's great but i don't know.,6/13/1995 13:13
258,258," Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I love that show, it has won a bunch of awards",11/4/2011 10:04
258,1867, I watch all 7 seasons. it's all are good.,7/7/1971 10:12
258,1867, Yeah I love them. And I didn't know that Arya is the fastest growing baby girl name in the United States period that is definitely due to Game of Thrones,1/14/1979 19:13
258,1867, good morning to you,2/9/1990 15:45
258,258, Good morning! Are a fan of The Simpsons? Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them. ,8/2/1982 9:46
259,1822," I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied",9/10/1991 3:26
259,1822," They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes. ",4/6/1993 20:06
259,259, with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central?,5/22/2021 14:49
259,1822," Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour. ",5/27/2002 1:21
259,259, oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company?,12/12/2019 15:09
259,1822, I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college. ,10/15/2016 6:58
259,1822," wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/",2/8/1997 10:38
259,259," I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so. ",10/25/2004 0:13
259,259," which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit",4/10/1972 0:56
259,1822," Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare. ",5/16/1981 11:37
260,1280," wow. I never cared for her books, did you?",6/9/1999 8:18
260,1280, No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards! Now that's cool. ,9/25/1972 6:40
260,1280, sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha,5/21/2012 7:28
260,260," Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn't sign it into law. If only the rest of the country would follow suit - and then pass it into law. ",10/14/1971 0:09
260,1280," yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit",1/4/1999 15:47
260,1280," Totally agree. It's ridiculous that we don't haver it in this country. Someday, I think. Hopefully. ",1/28/2008 3:25
260,1280, Some candidates are pushing for it! sadly those guys dont win office,12/11/1997 3:14
260,1280," Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels. ",7/16/1974 6:59
260,260, imagine that? haha duels in court would be hilarious ,6/30/2018 17:02
260,1280, Do you like Taylor Swift?,2/16/2005 21:51
261,1194, I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop. How about you?,3/10/1997 5:47
261,261," I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ",2/12/1974 2:55
261,1194, It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation!,10/27/1995 19:44
261,1194," I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her",1/19/2005 0:09
261,1194," Well, they called her a snake.  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes?",9/10/2007 12:04
261,261," No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals",3/11/2011 14:50
261,261," I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones?",1/25/1992 13:47
261,261," I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them",8/10/1989 0:19
261,1194," No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom?",2/11/2002 4:29
261,1194," Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes",2/22/1991 0:55
262,42," I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors?",3/31/1974 20:34
262,262," I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park",7/3/1975 5:01
262,262," When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself!",11/21/1972 2:54
262,262," Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment.",1/21/1983 6:38
262,42," I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.  While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming, I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one?",7/25/1991 3:48
262,42," I bet at least a few of them did, a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002, the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers",8/4/1985 8:47
262,262," Well, Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s.  Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the Reputation concert tour or has that wrapped up?",9/19/1972 8:31
262,42," I guess its all wrapped up by now, I think this article is a bit old, I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah.",7/15/2003 21:31
262,42," I glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud.  While I not much of a fan of her current music, she is a talented artist.  She also is quite a philanthropist.  Did you know she donated all proceeds from Wildest Dream song to African wildlife conservation?",2/7/1991 5:47
262,42," No, I didn't know about that, seems like she has a great great, I will follow her example from now on, anyways it's been cool to chat, thanks for all the facts and knowledge",5/23/1972 16:31
263,263," Well, its time to start cycling to work.  Nice chatting with you.",10/26/1983 4:56
263,263," That will do some favors to the enviroment for sure, nice chatting, have a nice day. ",9/5/1989 8:21
263,263, Do you like snakes?,3/16/2013 17:49
263,263," they are kind of gross to me, but do you like them?",1/31/1993 12:48
263,580," Yeah there history is strange. Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol. ",1/9/1992 7:31
263,580," really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar",10/4/1976 18:04
263,263," You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there.",12/20/1983 18:36
263,580," i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion",7/31/1982 3:51
263,580, Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys.,12/5/2018 5:51
263,580, maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case,2/28/1977 12:17
264,882, Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is? ,7/17/1970 4:24
264,882," I do, I am a big fan of her music!",1/27/1998 1:57
264,264, she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy's. ,12/27/2019 11:42
264,882," she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself",4/6/2010 1:08
264,264, Yes she is and to be so young it's great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice.,7/29/1974 12:40
264,882," yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity",11/4/2002 13:33
264,264, Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don't last forever. ,12/19/2020 5:11
264,264," that is true, she knows her stuff, she took her music off spotify so it was not free, she is kind of money minded",6/8/2013 22:18
264,882," Well that's good. Apparently she accidentally released 8 seconds of white noise and topped Canadian itunes charts, lol.",4/9/1993 10:14
264,264," that is insane, just imagine being that popular, most people never even see that much success",11/23/1984 13:28
265,1720, Right! Her walking backward to avoid picture taking is a ;little weird though. ,10/11/1997 19:56
265,1720," i guess i sort of get that, it must be annoying being public so often",1/11/2021 8:04
265,1720, I can't even imagine. Nice chatting with you!,9/20/2022 5:21
265,1720," Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?",9/14/1977 5:50
265,1720, Mostly other. Certainly not Fox. ,1/19/1997 22:55
265,265, Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends?,6/30/2014 6:14
265,265, I had heard something about it. Weren't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans?,3/29/2017 20:48
265,1720," Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control",3/31/2011 16:16
265,265, That's terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly. ,11/25/2021 1:54
265,265, All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present.,11/9/1999 15:10
266,266, We should have known it's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon. ,7/16/2021 19:13
266,266, I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined.,8/26/1996 21:07
266,232, That's sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that. ,10/25/2009 8:50
266,232, I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon.,10/28/2001 14:47
266,266, I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd. ,9/5/1984 5:25
266,232, It seems like a strange coincidence? ,4/16/2022 10:49
266,266," Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853. ",4/8/1996 8:53
266,232, Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party.,4/11/1987 22:50
266,266, You may be correct. I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928!,7/7/1985 18:35
266,266," Wow! I didn't know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential. I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change, only starting in 2000. I wonder if they used any other colors before then?",7/31/2013 15:57
267,267, That is a good question. I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time period than that. Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wasn't associated with Republicans. ,12/5/2005 11:35
267,267," Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment",10/13/1992 14:04
267,1766," Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII. ",8/27/2002 17:28
267,267," I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. ",11/7/2004 21:00
267,267, I agree. What a horrible blight on our history.,8/22/1984 18:41
267,1766, Did you know that the Beatles song Come Together was written for Timothy Leary? ,4/2/2009 16:49
267,1766," No I did not, but it wouldn't surprise me since Leary's research was about the use of psychedelic drugs.",7/3/1990 12:41
267,1766," Yeah, I remember that, he was pretty out there, right? ",9/20/1989 6:36
267,1766," Yeah, he wrote about every drug under the sun haha. Although, a lot of recent evidence has proven some of his theories correct",9/17/1979 20:47
267,267, Like which ones? I'm not familiar with a lot of them. ,8/17/2006 17:51
268,1512," I think like ecstasy, mushrooms, and LSD, pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans.",12/29/1990 10:09
268,268," OMG, I read about that. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota's governor declared martial law? ",2/27/1980 3:02
268,268," That's crazy, do you know for what exactly?",8/29/1977 14:25
268,268, I'm not sure. But I know that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. ,11/2/1978 23:06
268,1512," Yeah, and it's crazy that Texas used to be a blue state until the 1980s, then it turned very red haha",6/5/1989 3:41
268,268," Interesting, like the ground turned red? Or you mean politics? ",12/16/1990 0:39
268,1512," No, like in politics. It used to be mostly democratic. More interestingly, the blue and red colors tow denote the two parties weren't legitimately used until 2000. ",11/25/1993 18:31
268,1512," Oh, so like a long time ago Democrats were pro slavery I think. Wasn't Honest Abe a republican? ",4/27/1985 9:38
268,268," Yeah, he was. The parties have flip flopped so much throughout US history. But on a lighter note, every president who has had a beard has been Republican, which is really crazy.",4/23/2021 22:24
268,268," I'm not sure if that is true, sadly I don't know a lot about politics, so I can't call that out if it is wrong. ",9/2/2005 7:13
269,1970, I'm somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed.,12/9/2000 1:02
269,269," Nah, I think it is at its best now. Most entertainment in years. ",9/21/1984 22:12
269,1970, Haha that's so true,9/13/2016 18:47
269,1970," You know there hasn't been a US president who hasn't been a republican or democrat since 1853, who was it? ",2/19/1979 13:24
269,269, I think they were in the Whig Party. But I don't the president. Tyler maybe?,9/28/1973 8:24
269,269, Do you own a pet snake?,4/27/2013 21:41
269,269, No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at.,4/5/1986 13:19
269,1970, They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes,5/31/1970 13:42
269,1970, What is your favorite type of lizard?,3/24/2000 19:52
269,1970, Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too,1/2/1991 6:21
270,321, Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile?,3/7/1981 12:38
270,321," Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they?",8/5/2006 11:07
270,321, Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own.,12/8/1983 6:15
270,321," They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course",2/16/1987 20:25
270,321, Do you like Taylor Swift?,1/16/2010 7:09
270,270," I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable",9/30/1992 6:52
270,321," Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi.",12/16/1983 20:37
270,270, She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too,8/8/1996 17:48
270,270, Do you know about the Tennessee state?,10/17/2001 20:07
270,270, Not too much. How about you?,4/16/1999 1:44
271,139," Yes, I know more than most would about the state. There are some big snakes there.",7/30/2009 1:50
271,139, What kind of snakes are common to Tennessee? Rattlers? Bull snakes?,5/28/1986 11:43
271,271, I think it's them rattlers!,9/23/1980 8:30
271,139," I had a bull snake in my yard last year, a big one too.",5/18/1976 1:49
271,271, What happened?,5/3/2011 1:29
271,271, I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard,2/17/1991 5:07
271,271, Was it a big one?,12/2/2007 5:21
271,271, It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was.,11/24/1985 23:59
271,139, Did you ever about them snake whistling people?,9/20/1986 9:11
271,139, I don't understand the question.,11/13/1972 10:48
272,272, Hi!  Do you watch the news?,3/29/1986 19:15
272,272, Yes I love watching the news. How about you?,11/9/2022 17:32
272,1333," I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get.",2/20/2014 7:52
272,272," Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on.",5/1/1995 20:01
272,272, Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings.,4/8/1996 8:34
272,272, Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.,11/4/1975 23:22
272,1333, Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that.,12/14/2004 22:25
272,1333, I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two.,9/14/1988 17:47
272,1333, Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody.,2/28/2021 1:11
272,1333, I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused.,9/13/2016 16:52
273,690, Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest?,6/23/1973 6:56
273,273, I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of.,8/24/1982 13:43
273,273, That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo,8/11/2001 10:47
273,273, No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either.,12/31/1977 15:53
273,690, Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out,8/30/2020 9:23
273,690," Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.",9/7/1987 23:49
273,273, He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh.,6/9/1970 15:52
273,690, Okay now I understand. He'd make a good mascot for the Demos.,6/28/2006 20:48
273,273, Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000?,1/4/1984 13:18
273,690, No I had no idea. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican?,1/5/1985 9:50
274,274," I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?",6/19/1981 14:21
274,1508, I can't think of any. I can't imagine someone getting elected today who even has a mustache.,8/20/1978 20:13
274,1508, Very true.  Haha.  Great chat!,7/6/2020 8:23
274,274, Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day!,12/19/1997 21:03
274,274," I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom.",3/8/1979 0:51
274,1508, That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests.,5/24/2014 10:08
274,1508, I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there.,4/18/2014 9:56
274,274," Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it!",2/15/1972 4:35
274,1508, I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards?,5/26/2004 22:24
274,274, That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont. ,7/16/1974 6:35
275,1869," That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay.",11/1/2004 12:45
275,1869, flying snakes? My worst nightmare!!,6/15/2022 7:56
275,275," I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all",9/13/1972 10:34
275,1869, True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?,3/17/1988 12:44
275,1869," I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar.",1/1/1986 0:08
275,275, She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to?,12/8/2000 2:22
275,275," Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists.",6/3/1984 14:11
275,275, And she owns a private jet!,3/27/2021 16:11
275,1869, I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart.,12/26/1991 23:10
275,275, That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want.,11/9/1976 11:58
276,1090," Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists.",3/16/2012 21:59
276,1090, Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken?,8/12/1979 10:50
276,276, Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more?,4/30/1996 23:20
276,276, I would think. Do you listen to Linkin park at all? they played 324 concerts in 2001.,4/9/2015 5:41
276,1090," Unfortunately, I have never listened to Linkin park. However, I have listened to The Ramones and they played a total of 2,263 concerts.",8/31/2000 7:42
276,1090, Wow! I was always a big Pink Floyd fan myself. They played in an empty roman amphitheater once. ,9/24/2012 14:49
276,1090, Were they recording a music video? Or did they just do it for fun? A ancient roman amphitheater sounds amazing,5/14/2022 6:54
276,276, I think they did a video there. Thats why there was no audience! The ramones did a lot of concerts. How long did they tour?,3/26/2020 23:32
276,276, I believe they toured for 20 years!. Anyway I think I will check out Linkin park. Thank you for the chat.,6/12/1986 16:17
276,1090, Do you watch the news?,5/15/2020 23:36
277,119, A few times a day.  ,1/3/2004 22:48
277,277," Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.",1/24/2011 9:30
277,277, They are biased and pro republicans. It is okay though.  Free speech is always good.,2/28/1975 4:55
277,277, Yeah your right. Fox was created by republican media strategist and a former president. ,10/15/2016 14:30
277,277, Richard Allies and former President Nixon created the fox news.,2/18/2012 17:40
277,277, The Two Richards that's right..haha!,7/30/2012 10:22
277,277," Yes,it was funny.  Do you know that Foxnews tried to sue the Simpsons?",4/23/2008 9:10
277,119, I heard they were trying to silence a parody of anti-democratic party agenda.,7/2/1981 14:51
277,119," Yes, you are right.  They want it to stop the Simpsons from parodying its anti democratic party agenda.",4/14/1998 22:00
277,277, They also discussed creating a channel that would only play the Simpsons.,1/2/1993 16:41
278,519," Yes, I heard about it.",9/21/1983 21:27
278,519, Not sure what they hoped to accomplish since the Simpson's were never going to stop clowning them. ,5/14/2004 20:22
278,519," They own the Simpsons, right?  Why were they against them since the simpsons have been generating money for them for years?",1/14/1992 22:15
278,519, Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?,5/26/2009 21:02
278,278, No I do not but I'm aware of the fact.,9/21/2022 0:06
278,278, Ok. On a different note did you know that when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor he did not live in Sacramento but instead commuted everyday by jet for three hours?,5/4/2018 16:09
278,278, I did not know that.  Do you know that the republican party is also referred to as GOP.  Arnold is a republican.,8/12/1986 6:13
278,519," Yup! Speaking of governors, did you know that Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only one to opposed Japanese American interment camps during WW2.",3/30/2001 21:24
278,278, I heard about it.  Good for him.  Those Japanese people were American.,10/19/1993 12:34
278,519," They were, so sad. Texas elected it's first female governor. ",8/24/2011 19:45
279,279, She was the second female governor in the US.,5/21/2011 5:58
279,674," Your right, nice chatting with you. ",2/14/1981 4:41
279,674," Hello, do you ever watch Fox News?",9/11/1973 7:08
279,279, I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular.,10/21/1988 1:08
279,279, Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons.,3/25/2014 4:12
279,674," That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel?",1/14/1991 22:48
279,674, Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News.,7/27/2008 8:11
279,279," Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm.",5/22/1994 6:35
279,279, Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.,3/29/2019 21:24
279,674," I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe.",9/10/1974 11:48
280,280," Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased.",4/22/1987 0:29
280,1337, I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news?,6/28/2019 20:01
280,280, They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon.,2/9/1985 6:06
280,1337," The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative.",9/7/1971 9:33
280,1337, That is very old. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853?,8/22/2018 9:22
280,1337," The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in.",3/11/1974 12:22
280,1337, I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.,11/20/1991 23:38
280,1337, I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  ,4/26/1977 13:00
280,1337, I guess so lol. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,11/12/2007 18:58
280,280, That's quite a while. I guess Trump might be starting a new dynasty. Will his daughter run? Who knows.,1/15/1999 16:32
281,281, Haha possibly. Who knows what will happen next.,6/25/1972 18:20
281,281," I would like to see some change in gov't. Sometimes old ideas have value. The only president to propose a guaranteed minimum income was a republican, Nixon.. I think that people are worried now and would like some security.",4/20/1982 8:36
281,281, Me too. It was good talking to you.,12/10/1974 13:20
281,281, Are you familiar with Native American books?,6/19/1983 2:43
281,281, I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans.,11/4/1983 15:43
281,281, That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy?,8/21/2003 23:50
281,281, Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history.,1/10/2015 21:35
281,705, True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation.,1/13/1999 3:52
281,281," A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written.",8/28/2022 21:10
281,705, Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.  ,2/2/1977 19:47
282,282, Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers.,12/5/2019 13:09
282,282, Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before.,1/9/2000 6:11
282,282, I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago,10/14/1996 13:27
282,282, Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character. ,10/18/2016 17:42
282,803," Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.",11/28/2000 23:39
282,803, I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals.,4/29/1994 7:15
282,282, I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the best of the worst opening sentences that people used to enter into a contest.,5/25/1982 19:15
282,803, lol  That would be interesting.  Didn't Sir Winston Churchill win a nobel prize for literature?,5/1/2021 1:54
282,282," That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development.",12/9/1999 3:28
282,803, You would think that would have been written about a long time ago.  Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?,12/29/2008 18:59
283,283, People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field.,7/10/2002 19:58
283,1884," Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.  I'm so used to seeing them stereotyped wearing black and white.",7/15/1983 17:42
283,283, Me too.  You know that every human society has worn clothes.,9/2/1992 14:12
283,283," I would hope so.  lol  I guess it depends on your body type, etc.",2/26/1981 16:06
283,1884," I suppose if the weather is perfect, a grass skirt might be enough, but it is still clothing.  Clothing is often gender specific.  Nice talking.",9/28/2010 14:00
283,1884," Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though.",5/20/2022 19:19
283,283, I don't really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology.,6/17/1989 16:29
283,283," That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read.",6/15/1988 8:16
283,283, And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development.,7/6/1986 11:19
283,283," That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare.",10/28/1981 20:03
284,1512, Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it.,5/13/1970 10:19
284,284," I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace",8/26/1998 14:06
284,284, Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!,4/25/1979 19:19
284,1512," Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that?",8/14/2016 19:19
284,284," Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel.",3/29/2018 10:24
284,1512," I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read.",11/24/1988 21:04
284,1512, Do you think that literature should be censored?,10/23/1982 14:21
284,284, Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature,2/7/2004 0:00
284,1512, But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers.,2/16/1974 15:30
284,1512, i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole.,3/31/2000 3:18
285,251," Have you heard of Tommy Orange's debut novel, There There?",12/18/1987 20:01
285,251," i havenr, whats is it like?",1/7/1989 5:52
285,285, It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It's a fictional story with elements of truth.,1/1/1987 7:15
285,285, I think that might be an interesting read.,4/18/2007 18:38
285,251," The story follows around different members of a large cast of Native Americans who live in Oakland, CA. I'm not sure if I would like it because I like books that focus on one character.",7/26/1986 1:00
285,251, I can take several focuses as long as I can put together what is going on.,4/5/2013 17:26
285,285," That's good! Some of the people speak directly to us and others use the third person, so there are diverse approaches. ",12/4/1977 14:39
285,251," It has been good chatting tonight, but my dinner is ready, and I must go.  I have a great night.",10/7/2019 0:29
285,285, Have a good night.,2/13/1976 10:26
285,251, I've been reading a lot of interesting stories these past few days.,11/2/1995 0:32
286,1221, Really? what have you been reading lately?,6/12/2000 15:13
286,286," A few different fiction stories, very interesting. One was Tommy Orange's debut novel.",6/27/1976 4:27
286,286," I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right?",8/13/2010 2:42
286,286, Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them.,6/2/1988 14:19
286,286," Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell",6/19/2021 12:41
286,1221," Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar?",1/11/2022 6:48
286,1221," I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though, ",11/23/1979 2:26
286,286," For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You?",5/22/2005 19:34
286,1221," I felt sorry about him as well, his mother is in jail so what kind of life can he even have, did you hear about the overweight joung man, ",2/7/2007 3:41
286,286," Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book.",6/8/1981 7:24
287,287," I agree, so do you like fiction? ",1/17/1991 12:21
287,287," I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in.",4/27/1993 2:08
287,702, I see well did you ever play the Super Smash Bros video game? there is actaully a long fiction piece about the game,12/3/1973 5:41
287,702," Yeah, I've played that before, I'm more of a reader though lol. I actually read two of Tommy Orange's books, he had a lot of characters!",3/6/2008 18:32
287,702," I guess thats a great book, I heard good things about it havent really read it, ",2/9/2007 3:31
287,287," What are you more in to - literature, clothing or gaming?",5/15/2004 3:01
287,702," I like all three of them lol, clothing is also one of my favorite subjects and I also like technology",9/10/1991 0:39
287,287," I hear ya, I'm really into clothing too. Switching it up w textiles and materials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in 1986?",9/20/1979 3:29
287,287," I didnt, I would buy an Apple tshirt for sure, I wonder why they dont have that clothing line anymore",4/2/1997 7:36
287,287," Yeah same. Also, this was interesting, from 1912 to 1952 architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events. How cool",1/9/2019 0:02
288,288," Really cool indeed, they should be events even now, I wonder why they took them out!",6/11/1994 14:59
288,1337, Are you a fan of fictions? ,1/1/1973 22:37
288,288, I am a fan somewhat!  I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino.,5/10/1975 9:11
288,1337, I'm not a huge fan to be honest. ,5/11/1977 14:57
288,288, Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then.,10/22/2006 9:10
288,1337, Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.,12/16/1999 4:09
288,1337, I didn't know that.  There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,12/25/2002 20:56
288,288, Interesting. Who is the best? ,11/5/1989 4:20
288,288, I don't know.  We'll have to go look on wikipedia.  lol  I know someone who was the best one year though in literature and that was in 1953 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.,11/26/2010 13:44
288,288, That's pretty cool. It wasn't for peace? ,2/15/1999 6:03
289,1312, Nope.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I wonder how they judged that?,2/18/1977 13:46
289,289," LOL, by who could read the fastest? I have no idea. ",9/10/1994 16:16
289,1312, Hmmm.....that I don't know.  I think it was some girl named ...Anne?,2/20/2015 13:50
289,289, Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986? ,5/1/1986 3:26
289,1312, I didn't know that.  I wonder if any of the pieces are worth money now as collectibles?,1/23/2003 10:15
289,1312, I'm not sure. It sounds like a horrible idea though. They should stick to phones. ,3/11/2011 19:04
289,1312, lol  Yes.  Did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color and they only wore black and white for special occasions?,4/28/1992 8:49
289,289, I can believe it. A lot of those photos I thought were for Sundays.,11/29/2019 12:01
289,1312, I always seem to remember school portraying them to wear black and white.  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says Made in China.  I'm not familiar with that brand.  They sound shady to me.,12/30/2008 12:11
289,289," Yeah, that doesn't seem legit. Well, nice chatting with you. ",10/31/2007 16:15
290,290, It was fun and nice chatting with you as well!,6/30/2005 2:49
290,290, Take it easy!,11/18/2012 13:55
290,290, Dogs or cats!?,10/21/1971 23:17
290,1929, Dogs!  100%,2/12/2001 19:53
290,1929, I KNEW I LIKED YOU! Google likes dogs too!,9/22/2013 9:32
290,1929," Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that. ",9/26/2005 9:45
290,290," what, me too. I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?",11/20/2019 19:43
290,290, I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog?,8/24/2015 15:52
290,290," I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?",5/13/2002 5:21
290,290," her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt. ",10/7/1984 7:22
291,1589," aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat",12/10/2016 3:29
291,1589," lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute. ",10/4/1989 12:03
291,291," ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets!",11/17/1992 6:02
291,291, Oh wow.  I hope they aren't neglected in any way! ,3/13/2010 3:16
291,291, I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian,12/11/1975 4:11
291,1589, Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!  ,11/26/2006 23:07
291,1589," I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals",7/5/2021 1:51
291,291," Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart. ",1/15/2019 13:27
291,291," that is so sad and so wrong. I think I remember there was a US person at the olympics that took dogs to save from being killed, it made me feel happy",11/29/1971 12:43
291,1589, Thats amazing!  Did you know dogs have  eureka moments where they feel happy solving a problem to get a reward?,4/10/2018 5:12
292,917," What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!",7/5/2010 13:32
292,292, Lol Same to Rocky!  Have a good one. ,8/3/2019 13:49
292,917, will do! bye!,4/8/1990 9:53
292,292, That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her.,8/9/2006 5:38
292,292," I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.  ",6/17/2008 19:39
292,917, I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them.,4/29/1980 19:06
292,917, It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word.,10/19/2015 9:09
292,917," On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog.",8/22/2021 9:57
292,917, I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person.,7/11/2018 3:08
292,917," Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one.",2/8/1989 21:05
293,1572," I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.  ",9/27/2012 15:46
293,1572, I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well.,10/30/2022 12:59
293,1572, There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses.,2/7/1973 20:10
293,293, I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one.,8/5/2006 5:56
293,293," I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased.",1/22/1988 22:38
293,1572," It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world.",7/14/1986 2:38
293,293," Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big.",7/17/2018 7:22
293,1572, I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me!,3/28/2017 1:53
293,293," Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise.",1/2/1971 14:43
293,293, In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well.,11/22/2014 11:09
294,1622," Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian.",5/28/1972 2:20
294,1622, For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know.,5/11/2013 5:53
294,294, Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people,3/7/1990 0:40
294,294," She's also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there.",4/15/1971 15:31
294,294, Very true.  Pets are pretty easy to please.  ,8/5/1996 19:10
294,294, That's probably why they're so popular worldwide!,2/7/2003 8:17
294,1622, Do you own a dog? ,11/30/2014 11:11
294,1622," I do, did you know that dogs were the first species to be domesticated?",3/29/2016 14:19
294,294," No, I didn't. I bet that is why they call them man's best friend. ",4/16/1989 20:56
294,294," I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans.",5/3/2001 0:32
295,1629, Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have. ,7/21/1999 3:49
295,295, I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives?,3/21/2005 4:16
295,1629," LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that? ",2/13/2006 2:37
295,1629, I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that's such a neat idea. ,8/17/1986 12:58
295,1629," No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been? ",6/29/1978 11:14
295,1629, I have many years ago. ,1/14/1992 17:44
295,295, Interesting. How was it? Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing? ,12/7/2003 22:55
295,295," It was a beautiful place. I was stationed there for a few months so I didn't get to see too much. I didn't know that. I always thought that dogs were color blind, but they're not they just can't see as many different colors as humans. ",12/16/1984 18:29
295,295," Yeah, that's what I've heard. The first cloned pet was a cat, did you know that? ",5/20/2016 15:23
295,1629," I didn't know that, would you call that a copy cat? haha",1/13/1995 12:56
296,296," Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. ",10/27/1977 20:18
296,901," That's crazy, I heard that Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena. ",8/12/1978 18:23
296,296," Yeah, he was a big conservationist. What number president was he?",1/3/1989 1:19
296,901, I believe he was the 26th. Did you know that in Japan there's more pets than there are children under 15?,3/7/1979 21:04
296,901," No, I didn't know that. They have a population growth problem it appears. ",12/1/2019 23:08
296,296," It seems that way. I've heard that it's illegal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their guardian. Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?",4/12/2019 15:33
296,901," Interesting. I know people in Boulder, I'll have to ask them that. Well nice chatting with you. ",9/17/1995 3:43
296,901, Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types?,10/15/1987 15:57
296,901," Hello, wow no I didn't. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.",6/27/2022 8:30
296,901, Good idea!  Dogs and elephants are the only animals instinctively understanding pointing.  I wonder where that leaves monkeys?,6/13/1978 15:11
297,1656," Good question.  Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans",4/29/2021 17:04
297,297," When they first cloned a cat, they named it copy cat.  Haha",10/12/1980 11:19
297,1656," Haha, that's good stuff there.  It is not legal to own pets in boulder, colorado, but you may be their guardian.",10/23/1996 18:51
297,1656," I wonder what the difference is?  Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets.  I didn't know this, but he had a bear (teddy bear).",2/8/1973 13:05
297,297," Wow, that's an interesting fact.  Check this out. In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15",10/11/1982 2:21
297,1656," wow, that's a lot of pets. Do they have 1 child laws too?",6/15/2012 6:22
297,1656, I've heard that.  Are pets also used in their meals?,10/6/2018 22:37
297,1656, I don't know.  The emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers.  He must have a lot of influence in various realms.,5/19/2021 3:18
297,297," Interesting, Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.",3/9/1998 2:37
297,297," And scientist john von neumann could by the age of 6, divide two 8 digit numbers in his head and converse in ancient greek. I wonder how that happens.",7/27/1986 3:59
298,445," Good gracious, what a brainiac.  The world wide web was invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland for the cern, a european state-funded research organization.",3/20/1992 5:47
298,445," I don't know how they did it, but scientists at Harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria",9/13/2003 4:18
298,298," That's nuts.  Many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.",10/2/1998 1:25
298,298, Scientist wasn't a term until the 19th century,6/25/2017 23:17
298,445," Really?  On another note, Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company.",6/1/1990 9:36
298,445, Does that mean they donate more to dogs?,10/8/1974 6:39
298,298," I'm not sure on that.  Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. ",2/7/2008 10:20
298,298," I don't know how, but there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living wild in Asia.  I didn't even know you could have one as a pet.  Sounds Dangerous!",8/25/1994 20:42
298,445, Fiction works comes from the imagination.,9/13/1990 20:18
298,445, Yes. I like fiction. There is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.,8/23/2007 17:21
299,299," Fun, Julius caesar actually wrote fan fiction of hercules.",10/7/1991 7:09
299,524, That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?,12/20/2014 2:06
299,524," Great, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction at all.",7/15/1980 11:26
299,524, I heard that. He thinks it's copyright infingement.,10/15/1993 10:47
299,299," Yes he does, Snakes are legless and carnivores.",5/16/2015 6:34
299,299," Ah. Yeah, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.",12/26/1985 16:28
299,524," Scary, New zealand doesn't have any snakes.",4/12/1978 1:58
299,299, That sounds great. There are legless lizards... almost as frightening as snakes.,5/3/2008 22:01
299,524," Yes, some of them have eyelids and ears!",7/30/2017 14:31
299,299, That's creepy. Makes me want to listen to music. Do you like rap?,10/8/1991 18:04
300,300," Yes, Tupac's music is in the library of congress.",6/17/1987 1:35
300,300," Wow. You know, Korean rappers invented compliment battle? ",8/26/2001 15:00
300,300," Interesting, rap is normally delivered over a beat.",2/13/2009 9:14
300,1600, Yes. It's original meaning was to lightly strike.  Now it describes quick speech.,7/17/2010 6:55
300,300," Yes, eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.",12/20/1987 5:08
300,300, Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.,6/25/1986 3:53
300,1600," Funny, the earliest rap was in the west african tradiation.",12/11/1996 0:53
300,1600, Oh. Seems reasonable I guess. Did you know that flow is a component of rap?,8/3/1990 22:44
300,300," Yes, flow and delivery.",9/9/2016 13:06
300,300, Good morning.  Do you like snakes?,4/6/2005 12:08
301,1893, Not really!  lol  I guess I do as long as they leave me alone.,3/28/2012 5:09
301,301, Same here.  Personally I'd like to live in New Zealand. I hear they don't have any snakes there.,1/26/1971 10:17
301,301, Nice!  I didn't know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs.,11/16/1971 19:05
301,301, Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births?,12/30/1973 2:41
301,301, Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth.,9/18/1993 10:08
301,1893, Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly.,9/11/1974 14:46
301,301," Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????",2/26/1995 2:09
301,301, i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself.,1/1/1983 2:07
301,301, I know right?  I'm going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn't want to be him.,5/2/2021 8:14
301,1893, Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes.,10/29/2018 14:39
302,302, I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones.,8/4/1974 1:07
302,1146, I totally believe that. i've seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there.,6/28/1984 8:00
302,302," Those salt water crocs. I wouldn't want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol",6/19/1986 0:46
302,302," Wow, that is actually a good question! I don't know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards.",11/12/1998 16:44
302,1146, That's interesting!  Do you happen to read any fiction at all?,7/4/1972 7:24
302,302," I used to.  I like the older fiction.  Speaking of, cyborgs are a lot older than we think.  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of one in one of his works.",10/28/2012 18:15
302,302, I didn't know that.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941.,3/13/1973 8:40
302,302, I didn't know that!  So he just accidentally made it up?,7/1/1982 4:38
302,1146, I guess so.  lol  Do you know what a drabble is?,3/26/2010 2:15
302,302, i honestly have no idea.,2/22/1997 5:20
303,303," Hi, how are you?",2/3/2017 2:39
303,303," Hi, I'm Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author's break through.",12/11/2015 17:53
303,303, I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out.,6/4/2022 13:00
303,303, That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad.,7/20/1974 8:19
303,303," Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?",3/29/2018 1:43
303,303," I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps.",11/19/2008 23:05
303,303," lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives",2/25/2004 8:54
303,342," I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that I was never a good little girl. Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way.",9/9/1987 21:35
303,342, There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,9/8/2004 13:19
303,303," That is interesting. I wonder if Camille's (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn't reduce her or her beauty to an archetype.",12/23/1999 9:47
304,304, Couldn't it be both? Couldn't her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately?,4/24/2008 20:03
304,304," Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress.",2/4/1980 18:52
304,304, Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty.,9/2/1974 12:23
304,304," True, of course some people think that the author goes to far by making all her female characters unlikable. They think that this undermines women by portraying them this way.",9/26/1991 23:42
304,304, I always question how the author should portray the protaginist in her own books... What's appropriate for the author is not for the reader. ,11/12/2011 0:26
304,1352, So true that the author and reader can differ on interpretations. I am glad that the author doesn't fetishize violence though. Many authors do that. She likes to show how it can be deadly to be male too.,4/4/1989 3:20
304,1352, That's a really good point and a nuance most miss. I believe great authors can use sexism and sex as a great distinguisher yet subtle at the same time. ,6/23/1975 4:49
304,1352," True, it is interesting how Flynn tries to be psychologically accurate above all. ",10/4/1971 6:19
304,1352," Going inside the mind of a ficticious person, created in your mind, must be difficult.",3/14/2009 3:34
304,1352, It's true. Have you ever read drabbles? they are only 100 words long. It is interesting to think how you could go into someone's mind in 100 words. It must be different then a long novel like sharp objects.,9/2/2020 19:53
305,999, Nice chatting with you.,6/15/2008 20:32
305,305," Hi, how are you?",2/10/2015 3:14
305,999," Great! Hope you're doing well! Are you a fan of fiction by chance? If so, there's a wiki you should check out that ranks characters in fiction by their powers and abilities!",8/21/1975 7:48
305,999, I do like comics. I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it.,6/20/1992 16:20
305,999," He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination!",7/15/1986 6:45
305,999, Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me!,10/10/1997 7:55
305,999, So true! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar's Hercules fan fiction sometimes. Or even Oedipus. I bet it's amazing.,8/30/2003 23:50
305,999, Just don't show George martin any... He's not a fan of fan fiction...,2/15/2002 12:15
305,999," Ha! Yeah I heard he claimed it's copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writers. I mean, he's not wrong, but a little over the top I'd say!",7/25/2018 15:54
305,999, I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process.,1/3/2014 17:25
306,306, Agreed! It's almost as ignorant as the judge who tried to ban a science fiction  comic all because it featured a black character back in 1950! The audacity of some people!,9/14/1972 15:01
306,1673, And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Stay in your lane your honor!,5/16/2003 16:02
306,306," Ha! While trying a suit filed against Eminem! I heard about that. Speaking of Eminem, crazy he wanted to be a comic book artist growing up. What might have been had he pursued that instead if rap!",10/24/2002 22:40
306,306, yeah. I think he chose wisely. I am not sure how successful he would have been at compliment rap though.,3/23/1983 0:47
306,306, Ha! Can't believe That's even a thing. But I suppose it's popular enough in Korea so it must be at least intriguing to see!,1/1/2006 18:58
306,1673," Intriguing, like Busta Rhymes voicing the reptar wagon in Rugrats?",3/8/1972 23:56
306,1673, Did he really? I'll have to go back and watch that movie now just to see if I recognize his voice! Ha! Reptar was a lizard right? Better that than a snake - or even a flying snake which there happens to be a genus of that can actually launch themselves at their prey. Imagine coming across one of those. Yikes!,10/19/1979 14:59
306,1673, Nope! I would run so fast! I am not a snake fan and then throw in a flying snake.... NOPE!,12/22/2012 4:36
306,1673, Same here. It's crazy that the fear of snakes is hard wired in both the brains of humans and monkeys! ,2/18/1978 6:42
306,306," I know. Poor monkeys have no idea, they just run. My 7 year old asked about getting a snake and I shut that down quickly!",10/7/1974 16:55
307,307," I don't blame you. I wouldn't want a snake or even one of those legless lizards that look like snakes even though they basically aren't. If it looks like a snake, I don't want it!",1/25/1987 15:18
307,1155, Nice chatting with you!,5/22/2012 16:57
307,307," Hello, do you like movies?",11/6/2021 1:24
307,307, I do. Do you like movies?,8/10/2015 11:36
307,1155, I do quite a bit. DO you know who hold the record for the most box hits?,10/27/1992 6:54
307,307, Denzel Washington?,4/10/1974 19:08
307,1155, It id actually Tom Hanks with $8.5 billion worldwide,12/14/1984 5:47
307,1155, WOW! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar.,8/10/2014 21:58
307,1155, I love Pixar too. Did you know Disney wanted to shut down their studio because sleeping beauty was a bust,3/24/1982 17:11
307,1155, That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad...,11/21/2000 7:20
308,411," I know, but good thing they did not shut down the studio",1/28/1976 18:42
308,308, Can you imagine taking your valentines to silence of the lambs?,3/10/2011 17:22
308,308," No, that would be horrible. Do you know which was one of the most expensive office flops?",9/1/2005 22:25
308,308," No, which one?",10/20/1972 18:15
308,411, It was Treasure Planet,8/9/1996 12:04
308,411, I had no clue?,12/23/2014 22:01
308,411," Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?",12/28/1996 17:16
308,308," yes, I do. Do you?",2/22/2018 21:51
308,308, Yes me too. Do you know which movie Bill Murray thinks is the best comedy?,9/14/1990 8:41
308,411, stripes?,11/21/2003 11:38
309,309, Actually Kung Fu Hustle,11/13/1987 2:51
309,309, WOW! I would have thought it would have been a good movie and not that one. I wonder if he was being sarcastic.,2/5/2007 21:40
309,367, I am wondering about it too. He called it the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy. Nice chat :),12/18/2019 21:25
309,367, Hello do you like movies?,5/1/1999 6:25
309,309," Yes, I do.  How about you?",9/21/2022 4:26
309,309, awesome!  Yes I love movies. Tom hanks is the highest box office star!,3/26/1985 13:37
309,367," I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office?",5/14/2020 8:50
309,367," Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff",10/4/2003 18:51
309,367," I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you?",4/6/2019 10:17
309,367," Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol",6/4/1988 2:36
310,310, Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ?,2/7/1973 17:13
310,310," Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras! ",4/17/1973 21:03
310,1124," I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie.",12/3/2022 13:01
310,1124, Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time!,7/11/1999 10:39
310,310," Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you?",3/12/2012 14:00
310,310, What is that?,2/3/1981 18:51
310,1124," Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I'm not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one.",5/30/1993 18:29
310,310," Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy?",1/29/1981 2:14
310,1124," Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!",10/25/1990 0:47
310,310," Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.  I dont know about that,  it was a great movie,  but not amazing lol what do you think?",12/6/1989 12:29
311,403," Me either, he must have had a few when he said that!  What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock from the sun beat out Seinfeld, Fraser,and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe.",12/11/2003 23:29
311,403," Yeah 3rd rock was funny,  but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends. lol ",6/6/2001 4:18
311,311," I agree, Seinfeld and Friends are classics.  I smell a bribe!",6/4/1974 3:52
311,403, Right!  lol Its weird that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows.  ,10/27/2011 18:35
311,311," Yeah, that is kind of odd!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.  ",11/12/2018 12:24
311,403," Great chatting, thanks. ",7/6/1991 17:46
311,403, Did know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?,5/13/1981 21:41
311,403," I didnt know that, I love him as an actor, he is so talented I guess that makes sense",5/19/2002 21:19
311,311, Disney should have used Tom in treasure planet it was the most expensive box office flop of all time. HAHA,9/25/1989 13:36
311,403," I bet the movie would have had a bigger box office with him in the movie, did you watch Trojan Wars?",8/30/1995 6:44
312,312," No, I didn't. I read that it earned over $309,000,000 in box office. Someone is rich.",5/26/2011 22:48
312,312," No, only $309 dollars, it was a failure in fact, it was one of the most expensive box office flops all time",6/17/2018 2:36
312,312, Oh! Thanks for that. I read it wrong.,12/30/1978 15:52
312,312," Yeah, the budget was of $15 million dollars, did you ever watch the movie The Silence of the Lambs?",7/31/1996 7:06
312,312," Yes, that is a very scary movie.",6/20/2017 11:24
312,436, It came out on Valentines day and it had a good box office. That was in the year 1991,1/1/2009 1:11
312,436," Yes, I think I read $270 million in box office.",1/30/1999 9:45
312,312," Yeah, that was a total success so do you like comedy films as well",6/21/1999 19:44
312,436, I love comedy. It's my favorite.,4/17/2008 7:41
312,312, Do you like Bill Murray? he seems to like Kung Fu hustle a lot. ,1/25/2012 1:42
313,838, I do like him but I don't know kung fu hustle.,3/24/1991 6:38
313,313," He says is the supreme achievement of modern comedy, well I dont agree with that, I didnt like that movie really",6/21/2015 12:30
313,838, I totally agree with you.,11/22/2013 15:41
313,838, Do you like the channel Comedy Central?,1/19/1989 2:01
313,313, I have watched a few shows on there. My son loves it.,8/18/1979 4:19
313,838, I love it as well but it makes me mad that they've cancelled over 100 shows since its creation,5/19/2008 20:58
313,838, I would think that what is funny changes over time.,2/13/2021 4:34
313,838, Yeah I guess so but many of those shows were good! anyways its been nice chatting with you today,4/18/2002 16:59
313,313, Nice chatting with you too.,2/28/2017 15:10
313,313, good morning.,8/11/1975 7:43
314,1736, Hi there!  Do you like comedies?,8/31/2011 13:29
314,314, Yeah I love a good comedy.,9/2/1978 5:46
314,314, Me too!  Did you see Bill Murray's Kung Fu Hustle?,5/11/1974 19:15
314,1736, I think I may have seen it. I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though.,10/2/2018 3:17
314,314, I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.  ,6/5/1979 17:02
314,314, I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies.,9/23/2009 5:24
314,1736, I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.,6/28/2005 13:54
314,1736, Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny.,3/8/2011 23:08
314,1736," Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.",4/5/1972 20:51
314,314, considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising.,4/12/2003 1:07
315,332," Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",1/30/1977 19:57
315,332, Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.,2/21/2000 20:29
315,332, Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is?,3/26/2000 11:00
315,315, Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money.,2/13/2002 23:27
315,332, Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure?,7/27/2010 9:10
315,315," It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty.",4/16/2002 10:34
315,332, I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been Treasure Planet which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time!,3/11/1991 7:47
315,332, I dont think I even saw that one.,10/15/2004 22:42
315,332," I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991.",1/23/1981 15:14
315,315, That was a good movie. Still a classic. Have  a good one.,11/4/1979 15:10
316,807," Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?",12/18/1986 22:28
316,316," No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods.",1/11/2021 6:36
316,807," Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods.",2/17/2005 9:24
316,807," I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly.",3/4/1974 10:38
316,807," True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches!",3/30/2008 22:28
316,316, I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to!,2/17/2013 19:53
316,807," Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me.",1/20/2010 4:04
316,807," That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve.",8/29/1991 2:02
316,807," I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers.",10/29/2011 6:02
316,316, Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted.,6/9/1974 3:10
317,1434," That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs.",6/3/1995 9:32
317,1434," Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way.",2/9/1985 11:45
317,1434, I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers.,12/23/1999 20:57
317,317," That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker?",9/19/1971 10:35
317,1434," I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958.",3/4/1978 9:37
317,1434," That kind of makes sense, since there's so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance. It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro.",12/17/1986 13:48
317,317," True, especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol.",3/5/1978 23:01
317,1434," Yes, it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time, along with Minecraft and Wii Sports,",5/2/2010 16:22
317,317," I can't believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov, the government owned the rights to it too.",10/27/1992 4:13
317,317," I guess that's a consequence of working for the Soviets. Meanwhile, the NHS in the UK actually advocates using the game for people suffering from PTSD.",1/8/1975 9:09
318,318," I could see that, it helps you escape what you are feeling and what not. Could help those suffering from trauma too.",8/27/1975 6:14
318,318," Yes, and research suggests that playing Tetris provides a quick fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking.",2/25/1982 22:30
318,344," For sure, a lot of stimulation. I am going to get going though, good talking with you, have a great weekend!",1/29/2003 11:26
318,344, Hi there. Do you like to play video games?,9/2/2004 14:22
318,318, I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all. ,11/2/2011 12:38
318,318, I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time.,2/3/2009 14:00
318,344, That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either.,12/5/1974 18:40
318,344," Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous.",5/15/1992 21:33
318,344," Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that.",3/20/1976 10:02
318,344, Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings.,7/12/2022 22:26
319,319," Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer.",2/3/1980 12:08
319,1185, You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.,10/30/2005 13:02
319,319," Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers. ",4/5/2014 2:20
319,1185," No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games?",3/6/1999 3:21
319,319," No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?",11/17/2011 16:54
319,319," That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive!",6/1/1991 20:03
319,319," Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance.",1/6/2013 4:04
319,319," When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha.",9/27/2010 16:22
319,319, I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile.,6/2/1979 17:52
319,1185, One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson's dance. I didn't know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented.,7/20/1998 10:06
320,84," That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done.",6/3/2002 14:02
320,84, Right. Bruce Lee was another great dancer. He won a Cha Cha championship.,3/23/1986 12:21
320,84, Did he really? Where did he do that? In the USA? Sounds like he is a multi-talented guy.,12/4/2003 20:01
320,84, That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing. Have a good day!,4/18/1972 2:07
320,84, Do you like birds?  I love watching them!,4/24/1975 13:03
320,84," I do, too! So many of them are beautiful, and even the ones that aren't are still incredibly unique. They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet!",5/25/2013 4:49
320,320, I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!,12/30/1985 15:37
320,320," Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests?",4/16/2011 1:35
320,320," That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey!",12/7/1980 6:48
320,320, Wow. I wonder if they're in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that?,12/9/1980 1:56
321,321, That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting.,8/26/2021 19:08
321,497, That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?,10/25/1999 23:45
321,497, That's pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance?,4/4/1987 7:31
321,497," Only if I've had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you?",3/31/1982 0:06
321,497, I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!,4/19/1989 8:02
321,497, That's pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer. He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958!,3/14/1996 3:27
321,497, Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves.,1/20/2014 17:08
321,321, Most definitely. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music? I guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age!,10/31/1979 8:13
321,497, I didn't know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive!,6/26/1986 6:15
321,497," Definitely! Though I can imagine why, standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes!",6/23/1970 20:54
322,322, Ouch!  That's all I'll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.,3/14/1980 22:22
322,322," Hey, have you ever played Tetris?",11/21/1988 12:39
322,322," I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!",9/10/1992 15:21
322,322," You, too! I may go play some tetris, but that whole phenomenon of blocks falling in my sleep if I play too long freaks me out!",7/20/2005 6:17
322,216, LOL Have a great night!,8/2/2008 17:41
322,322, Hello! What do you enjoy doing for entertainment?,2/3/2003 13:06
322,216, I really love to cook. Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for. Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris.,2/5/1988 9:58
322,216," Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says it's a bit like an acrobatic dance lol",11/1/1991 6:37
322,216," Great way to make a word picture, yes! I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers.",10/13/2000 14:14
322,216," haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos...",11/25/2003 4:39
323,1783," Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.!",10/18/2022 6:41
323,323," That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves",4/23/1978 0:17
323,323," Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question.",10/22/1986 22:58
323,323," True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958! I didnt know there was such a thing.",9/23/1988 2:25
323,323," The Cha Cha winner! How cool is that, Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete all the way around. I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol",2/24/2016 10:35
323,323," Yes, I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to shake shake shake, shake your booty haha they crack up everytime. They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds?",6/11/2020 0:30
323,323," How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too.",5/27/1994 18:23
323,1783," Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them.",8/10/1980 10:47
323,323," Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol",6/19/2010 11:20
323,323," haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting. Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping.. I wish I could fly! Vacations would be way cheaper!",5/10/1982 23:39
324,479," Gosh, that's a good point and they would be a lot more affordable. I am addicted to playing tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying. Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet, quit smoking or drinking. I use it for flying.",12/19/2004 22:37
324,479," Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created! ",5/14/2014 8:27
324,324," Yes, mine too. It is one of three of the greatest games of all time. Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two. The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD,also.",4/19/2015 10:19
324,324, Interesting! Do you know where it was created?,4/6/1979 23:02
324,324," Yes, it was created in Russia by a man who almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996. I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played. I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit.",1/31/1995 10:29
324,324," Wow, It was truly a great invention and it traveled such a far way... from Russia!",11/26/2009 23:50
324,324," Gosh, yes it did. Over every ocean too. The franchise sold more than 495 million copies not counting all the downloads in todays time.",8/6/1996 11:08
324,324," I learned so much today, Thank you. It was fun chatting with you! Hugs and much Love to you! Take care!",8/1/1993 0:43
324,324, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),6/26/2017 21:17
324,479, Me too.  Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence?,8/1/1987 15:53
325,803," am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol",10/29/2018 10:29
325,803," Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians.",2/19/1983 3:00
325,803, Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ?,3/22/1977 8:17
325,803, Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown.,10/12/2002 19:08
325,325, Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ?,8/14/2008 22:33
325,325," Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series.",1/22/2013 6:05
325,803," Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it !",11/23/2017 16:58
325,803," They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros.",11/24/1992 8:18
325,803, Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;),1/7/2017 22:03
325,803," Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland?",8/8/1974 10:34
326,23," Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :)",12/24/2013 10:34
326,326," You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable!",7/30/2009 9:29
326,326, well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol,3/2/1998 15:31
326,326," ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series.",8/14/1990 18:22
326,326, Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches !,2/14/1992 20:25
326,326, Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament?,8/21/1971 11:19
326,326," In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure !",9/28/2003 9:45
326,326," Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball?",11/22/1996 14:57
326,326," they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do...",9/14/1989 10:08
326,326," Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team.",1/21/1970 14:05
327,1122, Yeah.... that among some other reasons doomed our Polish team in World Cup... sad really...,6/30/1990 23:00
327,1122," Well, I would root for the Polish team.  I have great respect for your country.",9/18/1977 18:32
327,1122," as my for Yours brother ;)  what a kind thing to say, thank You ! :)",3/29/2008 17:07
327,1122, Thank you.  It was nice to talk with you.,12/17/1990 4:20
327,1122, Would you much of a baseball fan?,3/11/1999 8:08
327,1122, A little.  I just read something about the Boston Red Sox.  They has some hard core fans.,6/22/1990 10:35
327,1122, I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can't stop.,5/27/2003 1:26
327,327, Yeah. Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits. ,4/5/2015 10:27
327,1122," That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now?",2/9/2022 23:14
327,1122, I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting.,9/6/2013 18:23
328,68, I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team.,2/3/1988 15:14
328,68, That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That's good for your wife.  What country are you from?,8/1/2009 19:42
328,328," England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field.",2/23/2022 14:13
328,328," Well, a very belated welcome.  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn't realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.  ",3/24/1982 15:39
328,328," I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn't that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets.",3/31/2018 20:34
328,328," Yes, I had the same thought.  They are such rivals.  It's wild that baseball managers can actually play in the game.  I have never seen that.",7/20/2019 23:39
328,68," I guess it's in the rules, that's why they wear the uniform.  I'd love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day.",2/10/2009 0:08
328,328, Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.  Babe Ruth didn't look like an athlete so why not?,10/3/2002 5:26
328,68, So who did win the world series this year?  Was it Boston or another team?,11/11/1980 20:15
328,328," The Sox.  They played the LA Dodgers.  I'm actually a Royals fan and it was a bad year.  As an aside, I had no idea Babe Ruth blew a World Series by getting caught stealing in 1926.  Say it ain't so Babe!",8/27/2011 2:22
329,329," He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet.  New York should be able to forgive him",10/29/1970 13:08
329,519, I'm sure they have.  It's also hard to believe that the Cubs won back-to-back World Series games.  They have been mediocre for years.,3/11/1995 17:36
329,519," Guess all the curses are going away, there must be a statute of limitations on them.",8/26/2008 6:56
329,519," Ha!  Yes, the Curse of the Bambino apparently was rescinded.  The Sox won last...",1/18/2021 15:35
329,519," Nice talking with you, Go Royals!",7/6/2011 18:50
329,519, Do you watch baseball much?,2/14/1998 18:44
329,519, Yea I watch it during the world series when the AL champion faces off against the NL champion,9/17/1975 22:35
329,519," Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!",8/26/2019 7:01
329,329," Yea, they've been pretty good, kinda crazy the NY Giants refused to play them in the 1904 world series",12/3/1976 19:26
329,519," wow, I did not know that. Did you know the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since 1997",8/13/2022 8:34
330,1666," No, I guess Ben Afflecks birthday is bad luck for the Red Sox",9/30/1977 1:04
330,330, I guess so lol! Do you ever collect baseball cards?,1/6/2002 21:03
330,330, Yea but I never found 3 million dollars worth of cards in an attic before,12/23/2015 11:19
330,1666," Me too lol, talk about retiring early, wow! I wonder what cards he found in there. Maybe a babe ruth?",9/22/2012 6:57
330,1666, Possibly. It's crazy Ruth ended game 7 trying to steal home in the 1926 World Series,4/23/1970 7:41
330,330," wow, talk about ruining it for your team! Was he a yankee at the time or a red sox, I can't remember",2/7/2007 5:33
330,1666, Had to be a yankee since Ruth was playing in the 1926 world series,2/1/1996 0:42
330,1666," true, lol duh! Do you know why baseball managers wear uniforms?",12/30/1974 15:37
330,1666," Because the manager can technically play in the game, I know Pete Rose did a few times as manager",7/31/2013 18:12
330,1666," wow, that makes sense! I played semi pro and my manager jumped in a couple times, he was like 50 at the time!",4/18/1997 1:42
331,331, That's pretty crazy. Do you know up until 2005 the MLB schedules were done by a married couple?,1/6/1981 19:50
331,331," What do you mean, they went to the games until then or they created the schedules?",5/27/2015 20:33
331,331, They would make the schedule for all 2430 mlb games,12/26/1994 1:17
331,472, wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes  them now. Good chatting with you!,7/20/1997 21:43
331,472," Nice chatting with you too, I think I'm gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic",6/15/2002 7:39
331,472," Me too lol, or my grandpas, bye!",5/8/1994 21:04
331,472, Do you like dogs?,4/11/1999 3:41
331,331," Yes, I do.  What's your favorite breed?",9/14/1992 9:33
331,331, I'm more of a cat person. I was surprised to read there are 12 different dog blood types and that they can donate blood to eachother. Pretty cool. ,9/18/1996 10:06
331,331," That is cool. Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans",8/8/2017 23:08
332,332, That's interesting. Google's code of conduct mentions that they are a dog company!,4/9/1980 18:22
332,332," Haha, yeah.  Me too!",4/21/1992 22:25
332,218, Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.,5/10/1994 6:44
332,332, That's neat.  Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,9/4/1977 1:33
332,332," Wow, that's awesome. The dog was the first species to be domesticated.",5/4/2010 11:09
332,332, A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging,11/12/1991 14:40
332,218, Interesting! Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.,5/6/1977 14:15
332,332," Bill nye the science guy is the executive director of the planetary society, an astronomy organization founded by the great carl sagan.",7/25/2012 16:34
332,332, That's neat! Saadat shahr is a small rural community in iran nicknamed 'Astronomy Town' because of the residents' passion for stargazing.,4/17/2008 19:29
332,332, That's cool.  Didn't realize that.,12/15/1978 13:02
333,111," Yeah, the town clubbed together to pay for an observatory and on special occasions all the lights are cut to improve the view of the night sky.",12/17/1970 22:28
333,111, The fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship,2/25/2011 21:04
333,111, That's a shame. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.,12/29/1980 12:16
333,111," In 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize, and it was in literature, not peace.",11/28/1975 4:49
333,111, I didn't know that. Literature was an olympic event from 1912 until 1952!,11/18/1999 14:14
333,111," Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 until 1952.",4/13/1978 15:30
333,111," I learned a lot, Thanks for chatting! ",4/24/1978 5:18
333,333, Do you like Baseball?,6/10/1985 8:05
333,333," I do, I watch mainly during the world series times though",3/2/1984 8:30
333,333," Same here, I rooted for LA since I am from Cali.  But Boston is good too.",6/4/1980 3:06
334,334, I always rooted for Atlanta growing up.  They were a lot more dominant then.,3/14/1994 6:51
334,1110, I rooted for the A's.  That was crazy when the A's played the SF Giants and we had the Earthquake here.  We won and got that Commisioners Trophy!,11/10/1984 2:18
334,334," Wow, an earthquake during a game?  ",8/8/1995 14:27
334,1110, Yep.  The big one where a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed and the Marina District caught on fire.  The game was suspended for a few days but I think A's won it 4 of 4 out of 7 games possible.,11/27/1990 2:38
334,1110," Wow.  Thats crazy.  Im from Florida, so we have hurricanes, but we have quite a bit more warning.  lol",7/24/2021 13:05
334,334, Did you know the baseball coaches wear uniforms because they can actually play if needed lol.,12/26/2013 13:45
334,1110," Yeah, I wonder if they ever needed to step in, or it is just a tradition.",5/29/1970 13:15
334,1110, I think it is in the rule book.  It is called America's pastime but I dont know....seems like there are more NFL and NBA fans at least out here.,7/19/1970 12:57
334,1110, It does seem that way around here too.  Baseball is actually really popular in Japan.,12/28/1990 10:14
334,334, I heard that often...what is weird is why Kickball is called Soccer-Baseball in canada?,7/30/2005 20:31
335,849," It kinda makes since you kick it and operate like baseball, but seems clunky as a name, in my opinion",12/10/1996 7:41
335,849, I guess a leg subs for the bat lol.,6/19/1988 12:56
335,849, Yeah.  Did you know that the albuquerque isotopes are named after the team in the Simpsons?,8/30/1982 9:45
335,335," Smart, use a team already branded by one of the longest running shows in history.  ",10/19/2001 15:53
335,335, It would help sell merch.  people would want some because of the show.  ,4/23/2001 9:04
335,335," I don't think anyone will copy the Red Sox name, they have had it since 1901!",2/12/1986 5:54
335,335, Thats a long time.  I heard they started wearing red socks after the team the red stockings dropped red from their uniform.,12/28/2021 5:37
335,849, I might have to watch a little baseball this season now lol.. take care,4/23/2001 3:11
335,335, You too!  Good chat!,7/11/1988 2:36
335,849," Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams?",2/23/1975 19:03
336,336," I like baseball, but I don't really have a favorite team. Do you?",2/24/2001 22:39
336,1609," Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment.",3/10/1999 21:09
336,1609, Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox?,2/8/1999 22:02
336,336," Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any? ",11/23/1986 11:21
336,336, Indeed. Do you like the mlb?,8/28/2017 9:41
336,336," Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926.",12/3/1987 5:13
336,336," Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball",8/25/1991 5:25
336,1609," I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?",6/25/1983 22:27
336,336, I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl,11/7/2020 23:07
336,336," Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic!",8/15/2005 15:14
337,337, I guess attics are treasure troves,9/25/1992 1:16
337,337," For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises.",8/22/1978 1:05
337,337, I still haven't seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players?,7/25/2008 13:32
337,1822," Don't think so, but some of those managers aren't in great shape to be playing on the fields, if anything, they should just forfeit the game to save the managers from embarrassment. ",2/7/1998 10:37
337,337," True. i was surprised that if a player catches a ball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases",9/18/1979 12:37
337,1822," Yeah, I have yet to see that happen on tv nor have seen anyone attempt to do that. In Japan, baseball is also considered one of its national past time by how popular it is there.",3/1/1982 6:23
337,1822, I personally don't find watching baseball games to be entertaining although I do enjoy baseball. Games here are fundamental different in atmosphere as asia,6/27/2001 21:20
337,1822," Yeah, when you have much more physical games like football and basketball, baseball and even golf can be quite boring. Even the broadcasting of the World Series is boring to me unless the marine corps did something like they did in 1992 world series where they carried the Canada Flag into the stadium and it was upside down!",2/27/2003 1:06
337,1822, I wonder if it would be more exciting if the dodgers finally win a world series champion. they have more losses than any other team,10/10/1983 11:30
337,1822, It sure has been a while since the Dodgers won. Have a good day,11/24/2004 12:30
338,338," Hi, how are you?",8/11/2000 13:22
338,338, Hi! Good!,3/3/2021 13:40
338,1144, Do you enjoy baseball?,11/8/1972 17:51
338,338," I do like baseball, but I don't really follow it. How about you?",4/17/1973 19:15
338,1144, I love it. Watch a lot of games every year and can't wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run.,5/14/1993 17:34
338,338," Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol",6/30/2013 11:24
338,1144, Chicago Cubs. I'm from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley!,12/22/1995 20:21
338,1144," O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership?",5/18/1997 14:20
338,1144, I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises,5/13/2013 3:45
338,338, Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games!,12/11/2014 16:01
339,1836," That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year",1/4/2004 16:04
339,1836," Really! That is a lot, crazy! I didn't know that in Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball, interesting!",11/15/1981 19:08
339,1836, A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s. ,12/6/2015 20:34
339,339," Whoa, what a lucky find that was! Did you know the Chicago Cubs were the 1st to win back to back world series....but haven't won since....but I bet you know that!",5/26/1977 6:55
339,339, I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it's not your fault... You've been great!,6/24/1975 9:58
339,1836," Ohh, haha sorry....So in 1992 world series the US Marine corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down! nuts!",8/21/2000 12:36
339,1836, WHAT? That's a lot disrespectful. Crazy...,5/4/1999 9:44
339,339, Right! I don't know if that was a mistake or not....,4/2/1983 6:30
339,1836, I hope it was... At least it wasn't on national TV...,7/16/2021 6:47
339,1836, I hope not too! Gotta love the world series!,8/15/1974 13:06
340,340, Nice chatting with you.,11/17/2003 3:15
340,368, Great chatting with you too! Have a good one!,9/3/1983 14:06
340,340, You too,5/17/2004 21:59
340,340," Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks?",12/5/2012 14:39
340,340, Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy.,9/23/1973 15:17
340,368," I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course!",10/24/2004 6:48
340,340," True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states!",8/26/1996 8:10
340,340," Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money.",5/22/2015 9:32
340,368, I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area,2/25/1991 3:17
340,340, You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar.,7/18/2003 4:55
341,341, Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player!,11/14/2016 5:22
341,1421," Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in.",2/26/2019 0:38
341,341, Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet,5/4/1982 13:57
341,341," Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000.",12/16/1982 5:36
341,341," Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?",4/22/1988 1:37
341,341," Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime. ",1/8/1992 12:40
341,1421," Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs!",6/6/2013 8:25
341,341," Yeah, golf uses points called strokes though. Unlike baseball, less is more in golf.",11/27/2004 3:02
341,341," Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat.",5/19/1975 6:45
341,341, Softball uses a bat as well.,1/21/1993 13:19
342,5, True.    I wonder if they called it that when they used an actual soft ball.,4/18/1999 9:25
342,5, I wonder if the fact that the game used to use a soft ball but now uses a hard ball has any influence on the records.,6/6/1981 22:41
342,5," It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport.",2/5/1972 11:41
342,342," That is pretty important, but it's usually played outside nowadays. Baseball started outdoor and remained outdoor.",6/8/1985 18:04
342,342," Probably for the best, although I wouldn't want to be outside for a 31 inning game!     Thanks for the chat!",3/21/1994 21:48
342,5, How's it going? Do you like sports?,6/3/1980 5:37
342,342, Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!,11/14/1991 0:43
342,5, Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.,11/24/2016 4:02
342,342, No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.,9/17/1986 11:20
342,5," Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course.",12/6/2012 0:15
343,343, Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.,4/26/1987 10:43
343,988, It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.,6/3/1994 8:18
343,343," I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?",12/5/1972 7:23
343,988, He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.,6/2/2013 9:11
343,343, He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!  ,7/21/2017 9:05
343,988, Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird.,7/17/1980 7:59
343,343, It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?,3/19/1999 15:23
343,343," They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though.",7/20/2009 9:27
343,988, I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.  ,5/19/2008 14:58
343,988," A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!",4/15/1989 19:27
344,383," That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.",9/15/1973 4:05
344,344," Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.",4/12/1999 2:31
344,344, No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.,6/4/1973 9:06
344,344," Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.",6/17/1998 19:28
344,383," I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?",11/8/1982 7:42
344,344, Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.,7/11/2020 17:21
344,383, Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?  It can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once.,9/25/1971 17:18
344,383, I am a baseball fan. I used to collect cards but I really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars.,2/26/1980 4:29
344,383, After hearing about that man I wish I had collected them.  The ones he found though were from the 1900s.  They had been stashed away since the 1940s. ,1/26/2015 12:44
344,344," I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s.",6/7/2003 16:58
345,345, I don't know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it's america's national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places.,7/21/2020 14:04
345,345, I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well.,9/30/2005 12:56
345,345, I've heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america.,7/21/1995 9:50
345,1166, That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs.,6/8/2013 20:44
345,1166," It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed?",5/29/1997 13:36
345,1166, In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well. Now I don't think most managers would be able to last in the game.,1/23/1984 14:30
345,345," True, some of them look a bit out of practice.  What do you think of softball?  I didn't know it was invented by the ymca.",6/20/1973 9:30
345,345," I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball.",12/6/1976 4:28
345,345, i like playing too.  What i learned recently was that it was originally invented as an indoor game though. I never knew that before!,11/25/1981 4:31
345,1166," I can't imagine it as an indoor game, that seems more like wiffleball to me.",12/13/2002 19:29
346,1794," It does seem odd.  You know, it's supposed to be a faster game than regular baseball and yet the longest softball game in history went for 31 innings.  That is a long game!",12/17/2015 18:12
346,1794," Any league I've played in always had rules to prevent that from happening! I couldn't imagine being involved for 31 innings, that's almost 3 baseball games.",3/16/2006 4:43
346,346, I imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.  Softball really doesn't get as much respect as baseball even with that super long game.  Professional players only make around 5 or 6 thousand dollars a year.,11/2/1994 23:41
346,1794," It's really hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US. With the popularity of the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL, they dominate the sports scene.",6/21/1992 22:48
346,1794, They definitely do at that.  It's sad to think about it though because the game has been around since 1887.,10/11/1981 9:32
346,1794, At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up.,4/23/1994 20:07
346,346, True. They invented volleyball too.,6/24/1984 5:36
346,346, hi how are you? do you like sports?,10/27/1997 3:20
346,1794," I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports",12/12/1972 9:04
346,346, do you like golf? i have never played golf.,7/10/1970 23:37
347,1220, I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible.,2/11/1974 10:33
347,1220, I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played?,2/27/2009 9:20
347,1220, I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.,4/29/1995 5:54
347,1220," Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff?",5/25/1992 0:21
347,347, Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.,1/2/1974 18:02
347,347, I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.,6/18/1990 8:12
347,1220," The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day.",2/3/1975 0:06
347,347," That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal.",10/8/1977 8:38
347,347," This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain.",1/10/2005 8:49
347,1220," That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby.",12/30/2015 1:46
348,1248, I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer?,1/27/2015 2:13
348,348, Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl.,4/23/1997 13:53
348,1248, No this baseball player was back in the 1920s.,9/18/2002 8:43
348,348, The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall.,11/3/1988 16:48
348,348," You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer.",5/4/1993 5:12
348,348," That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far. Anyway, great chat!",4/23/1973 15:51
348,1248, Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!,6/30/2004 11:57
348,348, You too! Have a nice weekend!,9/21/1984 13:18
348,348, you have a nice weekend as well. ,5/16/2015 5:24
348,348, Thanks!,1/28/1979 19:35
349,349, Bye!!!,3/22/1994 3:48
349,349, Do you watch the show Fixer Upper?,3/14/1973 15:39
349,99," Hello, I do. What about you?",2/17/1977 14:25
349,99, I have yes. They are having another baby,6/3/2006 11:47
349,349, That's pretty cool. Do you like attending concerts?,4/26/2004 19:42
349,349, I do. I would love to go to a show at an old roman amphitheater,3/24/1988 16:22
349,349, That would be very cool to see. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts back in 2001?,3/17/2010 0:27
349,349, Thats a lot of shows. They were very popular when they first hit the scene,10/4/2020 18:59
349,99, I agree. I love Linkin Park. What about you?,9/1/1998 11:30
349,349, I do as well. Sad about chester,1/14/1980 14:56
350,350, I agree. Such a waste of talent to go out like that.,8/19/2009 2:56
350,116, Just like the waste during a 2002 concert. Creed was sued because it was so bad,5/5/1992 6:42
350,350, That's funny they were sued. I bet it was very bad.,2/5/2014 3:33
350,350, Are there any artist that you would like to see live?,3/26/1998 9:55
350,350, I would love to see Pink Floyd. What about you?,4/23/2016 11:07
350,116, Eminem is on my bucket list. He made kanye rewrite his part in a song after hearing eminems verse,1/21/2009 7:27
350,350, It would be very cool to see Eminem. The Ramones played 2263 concerts in 20 years.,11/18/1978 21:21
350,116, That must of taken a toll on them. 20 years non stop,4/25/1980 5:59
350,116, I bet. Do you like Drake?,7/1/1975 20:43
350,116, He is ok. Makes good club music,3/6/1974 8:42
351,1707, I agree. Not music I would listen to on a daily basis.,3/8/1972 8:43
351,351, Did you know he didnt graduate high school until 25?,12/24/2001 15:26
351,1707," I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.",8/9/2004 12:43
351,1707," Hello, do you like Drake as a singer?",12/16/2017 2:08
351,1707," Hey there, yes he is okay. Do you know his real name?",12/31/1974 13:14
351,1707, Yes it is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is a Canadian,8/31/1986 0:13
351,1707, Yes he is. He graduate high school at 25,9/27/1991 9:05
351,351, Better late than never I guess. He also seems to be a lot into kids books like winnie the phooh and charlotte's web,11/12/1983 2:53
351,1707, Yeah I wonder who it was for though. Did you know the beat from hotline bling is sampled?,11/28/1999 13:56
351,1707, Oh yeah heard that it was sampled from Why we can't live together of TImmy THomas,6/3/2021 2:19
352,513," Yeah pretty cool, that song was out before Drake was born back in 1972",7/9/2010 16:13
352,513, Yeah exactly. Once he visited Drake University in the middle of the night when the students did not expect it,9/10/2014 3:09
352,513, Wow that must have been awesome for them. Do you go to concerts much?,4/12/1995 21:22
352,513," I do from time to time. In 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts alone, mind blowing",1/27/2018 4:40
352,352, When did they rest? Wow that is pretty amazing. THe Ramon toured for 20 years too,10/10/2012 11:02
352,513," Right, and they played a staggering 2263 concerts during that time",6/4/2002 8:56
352,513," WOw, those guys honestly. In Craotia there is an ancient theater that is still used for concerts",10/13/1980 20:43
352,513, Hmm sounds like the one PInk FLoyd used in Pompeii for a concert without an audience,11/1/2004 3:46
352,513," What a waste, I would have liked to be there for sure. Creed concerts was really bad though that they got sued",6/29/1989 16:36
352,513, Wow must have been really bad then. DO you ever shop at target?,10/29/1971 5:13
353,353, Yes quite a bit. They will match Amazon prices so it makes it a good place to shop,2/18/1994 0:12
353,353, Nice I did not know that. There is no Target in Vermont though,4/19/2017 7:34
353,1451, SO I guess they have to stick with Amazon. And they do not carry tobacco products since 19,7/16/2005 3:20
353,1451, Hmm so I guess not a good spot for smokers either,7/21/2014 19:14
353,1451, do you go to concerts?,10/1/2002 7:05
353,353," I go when I can, how about you?",3/29/1983 3:54
353,353, Me too. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?,9/17/1996 23:21
353,353, Wow that is amazing. How did they have time to rest?,7/11/1984 22:21
353,1451, Exactly. The ramones also toured for 20 years straight,10/4/2018 12:54
353,353, WOw that is amazing. Did you know ABBA turned down an offer to have a reunion?,5/4/1980 3:43
354,354," Yeah they played 2263 concerts during that time. They did, why?",7/28/1977 21:04
354,1037," Wow amazing. Yes, they turned down a $1 billion offer",9/11/2012 9:55
354,1037, WOw. A Creed concert was really bad that people sued them once,7/5/2004 19:55
354,1037, That is too bad. DO you like Drake?,2/21/2022 6:05
354,1037, I like him somewhat. Do you know when he graduated high school?,7/26/1986 15:44
354,1037," Hmm I am not sure actually, was it recent?",6/11/2007 5:34
354,354," Yes pretty recent, it was in 2012 when he was 25",12/26/1971 14:57
354,1037," Yeah better late than never I guess for him, he was busy otherwise",2/8/1986 9:36
354,354, True . DO you know his real name or full name?,12/5/1998 16:00
354,1037, Yes his name is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is Canadian,8/9/2004 7:21
355,355, Yeah. Did you know the beat for Hotline Bling is sampled?,7/22/2005 6:17
355,1838," Did not know that, from which song?",4/15/2020 8:52
355,355, It is the song WHy can;t we live together?,11/10/2017 20:52
355,355, Nice. Did you know he was in Degrassi?,4/4/1977 12:16
355,355," Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you",7/1/2009 22:57
355,355," Same here, have a good one.",7/22/2007 10:59
355,1838," Hello there, do you attend many concerts these days?",3/21/2000 16:01
355,1838," Nope. More of a TV watcher. But know a little about the fabulously successful rapper, Drake Graham, or Drake, from Canada. Heard of him?",12/2/2011 3:24
355,355," Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school?",8/18/1998 11:53
355,1838," They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade?",1/28/1970 15:29
356,1761," Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough. ",1/8/1997 11:24
356,356," Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He's also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid!",5/31/2007 23:07
356,356," No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well!",9/7/2017 13:46
356,1761," Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album.",4/15/1987 22:36
356,1761, That is very impressive.  Did you know he once sampled a Timmy Thomas hit?,2/13/1970 3:27
356,1761," No. As I mentioned, I'm more of a TV watcher. Although I'm not into reality TV much, one show I'll miss that's recently concluded after 5 seasons on HGTV is Fixer Upper. Ever see it?",7/10/2018 1:03
356,1761," No thats not one that I have seen before, is it pretty good?",2/20/2001 10:35
356,1761," It was, actually. Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving.",4/13/2021 6:28
356,1761," That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can. ",4/26/1988 7:00
356,1761," You'll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There's a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew?",12/23/1993 16:55
357,764," Well I can respect them making that decision, I'm sure it's best for their family. ",9/10/2021 17:16
357,357," Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there's a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today.",5/16/1999 12:00
357,357," Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well. ",1/23/2013 8:40
357,357," If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they're written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there?",6/27/1980 8:30
357,764," Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks!",8/19/2000 10:17
357,357," I know Target well because I witnessed their growth from one location in the Roseville Shopping Center in the suburban Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN to Target becoming the 8th-largest US retail department store today. Ever heard about Target's history?",11/10/2018 10:08
357,764," No, I can't say I know a whole lot about that.  But, it's been nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!",9/25/2000 15:16
357,764," I am sure that you know that Black Panther is a Marvel Comics character, right?",11/14/2005 10:39
357,764, The richest superhero. Worth $500 billion.,8/31/2000 9:15
357,764, That's the one!  The origins of the script for the movie date back to the 4th century.,5/20/2002 19:05
358,875, The character was not named after the black panther party.,9/9/2000 23:15
358,875, No.  LOL.  Caught me off guard with that.  The old script was written in Nigeria.,12/29/1997 16:12
358,875, Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther.,7/18/1979 0:06
358,875, The film was sure a block buster.  Apparently Denzel Washington helped him get his education.,3/1/1974 23:30
358,358, Supporting his training at Oxford.,7/19/1998 7:14
358,875," I see.  To change the subject, did you know that over 80 of the earth's forest have been destroyed in the history of our planet?",8/27/2004 22:19
358,875, I believe it. We need the land for farming and people want the lumber.,6/7/2019 18:36
358,358," Yes.  I heard that when the Europeans discovered North America, a squirrel could go from coast to coast without touching the ground. Now we expect to have no helium left on earth is less than 82 years.",10/19/1981 11:16
358,875, I wonder if the aliens will need the helium when they finally settle on our planet. The UN now has an ambassador for extraterrestrials.,11/7/1987 18:33
358,358, Unless there really is warp speed I think it will take aliens too long to get here.  I did hear about that ambassador being appointed in 2010.,6/24/1980 8:30
359,158, The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water.,3/28/1972 1:31
359,158," Could be.  But if they don't have any they won't know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice.",2/19/1972 18:20
359,359, Do you read non-fiction? It's fascinating stuff.,11/4/2000 11:44
359,359," I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible.",10/21/2020 2:12
359,359," Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it.",7/9/1985 8:56
359,158, It is hard to write about things one has not experienced.  That is why Grisham's books are about the law.  George W Bush reading 14 biographies of Lincoln is a person trying hard to do well.,8/10/2019 16:34
359,359, He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school. ,12/29/1982 7:11
359,359, I agree.  Education should continue through one's life.  Who would have thought that one of only 8 people to have both a fiction and non-fiction best seller would be a country singer?,11/10/2001 18:24
359,359," A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!",3/27/2010 1:38
359,359," Me too, nice chat.",12/24/1981 6:11
360,360," Hello there, did you see the Black Panther film that was recently in theaters?",6/15/1980 1:05
360,228," Yea, I think Chawick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa",11/24/2012 19:00
360,228, I have yet to see the movie but I heard that he did a really good job as well. ,10/24/2021 13:05
360,360, Ryan Coogler did an awesome job directing Black Panther and Michael B Jordan was good too,8/20/1974 3:31
360,228, I heard the same thing.  I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well. ,10/18/1999 13:31
360,228," Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined",10/7/1980 19:18
360,360, That is crazy! I never knew there was one that had more money than those guys. ,12/1/1995 21:17
360,228," Yea, in the comics Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars",1/20/2022 17:13
360,228, Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century?,7/25/1985 3:29
360,360," Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region",7/5/1971 21:50
361,984," I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references. ",1/1/1982 21:55
361,984, Yea but it's unfortunate that they censored the phrase praise hanuman from the indian release of Black Panther,4/22/1986 19:47
361,984," That sounds really stupid to me, that overly pc stuff has gotten a bit too much for me. ",12/23/2004 11:52
361,361, The Indians weren't happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting,6/18/2013 14:53
361,984, Yeah and I don't blame them for feeling that way to be honest. ,3/15/1990 4:59
361,361," Yea people can be sensitive over trivial stuff instead of important things, like 80% of natural forests being destroyed",3/28/1975 10:10
361,984," Exactly, that is so alarming and people are more concerned with silly stuff. ",7/21/1973 15:10
361,361, Yea like the UN appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestrials ,4/21/1981 6:29
361,361," That too, I wonder how much the salary is for that job?",9/29/1971 19:29
361,984," Too much, I'm pretty worried the earth will be helium free by the end of the century",6/7/2002 9:59
362,447," Yeah I wonder what all the party balloon companies will do to survive.  Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day!",3/18/1982 15:17
362,362, Hello. Its pretty cold today. It makes me wonder whether more of the earth's polar regions are covered with ice today. ,8/1/2009 2:42
362,362, I know it is freezing... in Chicago it is near -24. So cold!,4/12/1989 18:08
362,362," Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion!",6/21/1971 22:57
362,447, That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month...,10/10/2015 19:50
362,447, Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party. ,4/4/2012 10:36
362,362," Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/",5/3/1984 21:14
362,447," That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?",10/20/1976 3:43
362,362, I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day!,10/23/1976 11:05
362,362," Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!!",5/4/2015 20:55
363,363, How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more!,11/14/1992 16:41
363,506," Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative!",3/15/1992 15:58
363,363, Thanks for the insight. I had no idea!,3/22/2009 3:19
363,506," I'm just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I', no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost.",1/4/2004 14:18
363,506, I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious.,10/27/1996 13:48
363,363, Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible. Did you know that the bible is the biggest selling non-fiction book ever printed? That's pretty impressive!,10/21/2022 9:04
363,363, I did. George W bush read 41 biographies of lincoln. That's crazy! I do not think Lincoln knew that much about himself.,9/1/2016 18:06
363,363, That's funny!! And probably true!! He also read 186 historical nonfiction books!! That's a lot of knowledge!,4/12/1977 12:34
363,506," Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@",3/13/2016 20:47
363,506, I hear ya!! Jack London lived as a poor down and out pauper and still managed to write a book about exposing the gap between the rich and the poor. So there's always hope!! Keep at your reading... and you'll get better!,9/12/1988 13:18
364,1935, I hope! I have written a lot so I hope it all comes together!,4/4/2004 5:29
364,364," I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going. Have a great day. Goodbye!",1/30/2005 3:26
364,1935, You too!,6/7/1998 12:09
364,364," Hello, what kind of genre do you prefer in books?",10/20/1980 21:49
364,364," I prefer non fiction.  Although in fiction, I like mystery and drama.  What authors do you like?",3/25/1978 21:02
364,1935, I do not have a favorite author but I love the Harry Potter series.,8/13/2000 19:57
364,1935," I enjoyed the movie, Black Panther which was based on a Marvel Comics character.",6/29/1972 9:49
364,364, I love all the movies of Harry Potter too! I love Black Panther. WAKANDA FOREVER!,2/17/1977 2:39
364,364, The director of Black Panther also co-wrote it.  He must have earned some bucks.,7/6/1992 16:24
364,1935, I bet he earns a lot of money! That was a popular movie.,10/29/1973 6:05
365,365, His name is Ryan Coogler.,2/19/2018 14:09
365,1167, Ryan Coogler? It made me think of cougar,5/14/1984 13:55
365,1167, One woman got a role in the movie and began her acting career at age 88. That's old,10/11/1998 0:03
365,365, I agree. Unless she has that energy.,3/29/1974 11:04
365,365," Marvel started a studio to do the film.  They borrowed money and put their other characters up as collateral.  If the studio had failed, Merril Lynch would have owned Captain America and others.",11/21/2000 9:04
365,365, I started liking Marvel after Spider Verse. That is crazy.,2/16/1972 6:12
365,365," I grew up on DC comics, but Marvel has cut their own niche.  Denzel Washington helped Chadwick Boseman financially to study at Oxford 20 years ago.  That produced a great result.",6/4/1972 7:01
365,1167, What is your favorite DC comic?,1/13/2018 0:09
365,1167, I prefer Superman but Justice League is a close second.  He can turn back time by circling the earth.  The earth is the densest of the 4 terrestrial planets.,8/21/2018 12:58
365,365, Have you watched Bumblebee? ,6/17/1993 8:57
366,366, I don't know what that is.  Enlighten me.,9/10/1989 17:57
366,366, Have you heard of Transformers?,8/26/1982 22:32
366,366, Of course.  They would certainly be in the genre of Sci-fi if they were in a book.,4/8/1979 17:07
366,366, Bumble bee is that one yellow robot. That movie is all about him.,5/9/1980 15:27
366,366, I see.  Guess I will go now.  ,5/25/1995 1:43
366,736," Good morning, are you a fan of standup comedy?",10/23/2003 2:42
366,366, good morning. I am a little bit of a fan. Are you a fan?,11/8/1998 20:16
366,366," Yes, I've been trying to go to a lot more shows lately. I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny.",12/7/2010 3:52
366,736, That's cool.  I like comedy movies and tv shows.  Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?,9/22/1995 18:58
366,366, I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you?,5/20/2016 12:16
367,367," I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997.",4/16/1974 22:51
367,1357," That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV.",7/8/2009 6:39
367,1357, I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997.,9/7/2000 7:44
367,367, It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV.,9/11/1998 9:42
367,1357, Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central?,1/5/2003 12:38
367,1357," I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more.",12/23/1994 9:52
367,1357, Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989.,1/14/2014 5:29
367,1357, That's a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh's show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week.,7/31/1999 17:01
367,1357, Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i've never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one?,10/25/1994 19:50
367,367, They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well.,1/5/1989 21:19
368,368, So have you ever seen ken jeong perform?,1/10/2010 9:46
368,368, I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV.,1/20/1993 1:09
368,1365," Yeah, i haven't seen him either.  I heard he used to be a doctor of some kind.",7/30/2011 22:48
368,1365," Yes he was, it's a pretty interesting career transition from being a doctor to being an actor.",10/17/2010 21:52
368,1365, Especially to a stand up comedian/actor.  I wonder what made him do it.,11/9/2021 22:37
368,1365," He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!",5/8/2016 4:19
368,368, Have you ever had a seizure? I can't believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong's comedy show!,3/15/1983 11:56
368,1365, I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane,2/21/1990 12:54
368,1365, I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person! ,3/1/1992 10:56
368,1365, Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived,12/17/2016 8:16
369,369, That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing!,4/23/1975 20:39
369,369, That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones,3/21/1990 5:08
369,1312, I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy!,9/9/1979 20:40
369,369, I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage.,9/21/1997 12:59
369,369," So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??",7/30/1992 3:53
369,1312, no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows? ,2/15/2012 15:11
369,1312, Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now. ,5/3/1974 4:41
369,369, I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997,7/26/2013 4:25
369,369, I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are.,7/19/1987 10:57
369,369, I am a huge super hero nerd lol... I love the avengers marvel or dc comics idc I like it all lol,11/24/2007 13:41
370,1898, I don't know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book?,4/8/2021 0:52
370,370, Yeah Marvel published it in order to trademark the names of the heroes and villians,7/7/2014 12:47
370,370, I had no idea what dc comics stands for? ,4/13/1979 15:05
370,370, the dc stands for detective comics,12/31/2018 13:58
370,1898, Oh! I get that. Did you know that the Michigan State U library has the largest publicly available comic book collection!? ,3/24/1972 12:08
370,1898, I did not know that... I know that there are some that sell for a pretty penny,11/29/2013 5:09
370,370, So good talking to you tonight!!,5/23/1972 9:23
370,370, Hi! Do you watch any comedy?,2/12/2011 10:33
370,1898, Sometimes. What about you?,8/7/2019 17:58
370,1898," Yeah, though I have never seen any one perform live. Ken Jeong, the comedian is actually a licensed physician and even saved someone who had a seizure during his shows!",6/15/2010 3:53
371,371, Oh wow he is a real doctor? I thought that was just a bit for tv. ,5/10/2015 5:31
371,1172," He actually went to medical school and did residency to become licensed, but I'm guessing he makes way more as a famous comedian than as a physician, what do you think?",2/22/2017 12:24
371,371, That is crazy to think we live in a society where being famous can pay more than people whos job it is to save lives. ,1/27/1990 14:28
371,1172," Yeah, like I remember reading that the actor who plays Dr. House gets paid more than $700K per episode! I'm thinking doctor's make about that in a year or something.",5/8/1978 3:40
371,1172, Wow that is just crazy amounts of money. But look at the budget for movies like avengers. Billions of dollars. ,1/13/1977 23:10
371,371," Considering that Infinity War was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras, they probably needed that billion dollars.",4/9/2018 19:52
371,371, Probably. Have to admit it though it made for one heck of a movie. ,3/28/2003 20:55
371,1172," Yeah! Was it because of the script or the all-star cast which included Robert Downey, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christ Pratt?",7/26/2011 13:38
371,371, I think the script. They have taken actors that were only sort of known and really put them on the map with these amazing scripts. ,10/29/1987 13:05
371,1172," Yeah, I agree but what I'm wondering is what the movie has to do with increase in shawarma sales, do you have any idea, did I miss something from the movie?",7/16/1977 2:05
372,372, It has caused that? That is awesome! There is a scene at the end of the battle in new york where they all go for shawarma and are chilling around this table. It is iconic in the avengers universe. ,12/27/1995 8:37
372,372," Oh! I really did miss it, thanks for clarifying! Crazy to think how the voice actor who plays Jarvis has never seen any of the films! Wouldn't he be invited to the screening and stuff?",2/17/1971 5:13
372,1606, You would think. Isn't he the guy that plays vision now?,1/2/1975 2:31
372,372," Oh really? I don't know, I'd have to read up on the books to know. Did you have read the comic books before watching the movies?",6/14/1985 13:10
372,372, No I've never been much of a comic book reader. It sounds like there are some interesting storylines that could be turned into movies though. ,7/11/1998 1:27
372,1606," Yeah, me neither but it sure opens your mind to endless creativity like the universe takes place in earth 199999 years ago and there's a multiverse too!",3/20/1970 20:48
372,1606, Stan lee was a visionary. He will be so missed. I can't imagine not seeing his cameos in the coming movies. ,3/3/2009 15:48
372,1606, Yeah exactly and who's going to end phone conversations with excelsior like he did.,5/29/2000 16:26
372,372," Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong's",11/5/1977 13:56
372,372, Not really but I have heard of the show The Hangover. Some comics are really brutal and I don't like humor that hurts people.,9/30/2016 5:45
373,373, He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University.,1/24/1992 21:27
373,373, That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story.,11/28/1978 10:14
373,373," Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler.",1/5/1985 2:34
373,373," Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though.",11/15/1973 23:47
373,373," It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action.",8/13/2002 9:22
373,1387, I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes.,12/4/1974 4:47
373,1387, I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him.,5/6/2004 2:59
373,373," I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one. ",4/13/1999 22:21
373,373, Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic.,10/6/2019 12:29
373,373, That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.'The empire strikes back'  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies.,12/22/1979 12:26
374,553, YOU SHOULD DO THAT.  DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL MURRAY THINKS KUNG FU HUSTLE IS THE SUPREME ACHIVEMENT IN COMEDY?,12/7/1995 1:25
374,553," I don't know Kung Foo Hustle. Bill Murray is funny, though. I remember him on Saturday Night Live. Now that was funny. Especially Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase.",10/14/1977 19:23
374,553, Bill Murray is an all time great.  I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black.,9/9/2019 11:59
374,374, The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today's comedians.,2/13/2013 10:45
374,374," I didn't know that.  Speaking of comedy and movies, The Avengers movie Infinity War was the first movie shot completely with digital imax cameras ",8/18/2020 20:22
374,553," That's another one I haven't seen. That's is interesting, though. I like the raven's names Hugin and Munin.",12/29/1991 12:18
374,553," I am a huge comic book fan.  Lou Ferrifno, who played the Hulk in the original 1670's tv show has voiced him dor everything up until Avengers Age of Ultron",10/1/2002 20:24
374,553, There were a lot of big starts doing the voices in the Avengers.  I like the Hulk. I always felt sorry for his character.,9/29/2018 19:58
374,553," Yes, he is kind of sad.  Well have a Merry Christmas.",10/15/2007 5:56
374,553, Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?,5/17/1973 7:17
375,375," K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000.",7/29/1979 16:18
375,375, I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010.,8/27/1974 12:47
375,375," The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song hit your heart across the border using large military loud speakers.",5/9/2013 4:47
375,413, I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band?,11/26/1990 16:40
375,375," Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised.",5/16/2016 17:50
375,375," Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week!",6/17/2013 4:54
375,375, Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia.,12/26/1982 16:18
375,375," I think it is cool that it's still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy!",1/27/1986 1:34
375,413, Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised.,6/29/2000 13:57
375,413, Even Tupac dance ballet in high school and performed in the production of the nutcracker.,12/6/1975 15:33
376,376, Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible.,11/29/1977 17:54
376,1179, I think it's crazy how babies can do that. I can't believe Bruce Lee was a dancer and was even in a dance championship in 1958!,6/8/2004 2:15
376,1179," It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity.",5/3/1976 15:30
376,1179," That is an awesome type of art! I think birds are a type of art as well, especially hummingbirds that steal spider webs for their own nests.",4/20/1979 1:17
376,376, Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species.,4/14/2022 5:25
376,1179," That is a lot of species! In most birds, their skeleton weighs less than their feathers!",9/21/1997 10:25
376,376, So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed.,7/2/1992 21:24
376,1179, They even go without sleeping during the migration!,1/8/1996 1:10
376,376, Yeah. They no need of visa and other formalities.,8/29/1976 0:49
376,1179, They really don't huh? Have a good day!,11/1/1986 10:29
377,752," Hi, how are you?",10/20/1990 15:15
377,377, Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.,2/6/2021 20:59
377,377," That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu.",12/1/1985 18:41
377,752," Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker.",6/28/2010 9:35
377,377," Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow!",11/29/2008 8:55
377,377, I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat.,12/6/1995 11:10
377,752," Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?",11/18/2010 0:03
377,377, That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on.,12/24/1997 17:56
377,377, You're probably right!,2/21/2015 12:27
377,377, Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?,11/13/1989 18:35
378,378," Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons.",6/2/2007 22:41
378,90, That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping!,10/8/1979 6:44
378,378," I wouldn't make a good bird!  Couldn't do that, at all.",5/12/2004 21:59
378,90, Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon.,6/13/2019 13:38
378,90," Lol, didn't know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms!",9/21/2019 23:17
378,90, I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming.,8/20/1999 23:29
378,90," If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I've watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.  It's sad.",8/14/1982 5:02
378,378, It is sad. They are such a great indicator species of our environment. Everything from the smallest 2 inch hummingbird to the 9 foot ostrich.,4/16/1975 23:39
378,378," On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?",12/3/2002 16:43
378,378, I have and I was shocked to find out that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band.,8/6/1997 5:41
379,40," Wow, didn't know that about Jackie. Well, it's been nice chatting this morning.  Have a good Friday.",4/21/1975 10:25
379,40, Do you like dogs?,3/25/1992 12:16
379,379," I do, Im a dog person, what about you?",5/6/2001 2:42
379,40, I like them though I don't have one. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that can naturally understand pointing.,3/7/2019 4:16
379,379, They are? I guess both are really smart dogs can also see color so thats something. ,10/6/2000 9:57
379,40," Interesting. Always thought they were color blind. Google also prefers dogs to cats, so much that it is in their code of conduct.",11/12/2008 7:47
379,379," And that's why I love Google, that and also the fact that Google has saved my life many times lol",7/29/2000 11:08
379,379, I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.,3/19/1985 8:23
379,40, I guess those vending machines make a lot of doggies happy and also they help keep the streets clean. Its a win win situation I guess,5/30/2010 8:08
379,379, yeah I think you're right. Another good cause is doggy blood drives. However not sure how the dogs feel about that since they can't consent. Haha.,5/8/2003 22:30
380,380," There are 12 different types of bloods in dogs, how interesting is that",2/13/2006 6:51
380,380, Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?,8/17/1987 20:29
380,1674," I like small dogs, big dogs are high maintenance and scare others, what about you?",6/13/2009 5:09
380,380," Yeah I love a little dog, especially one in a little sweater or a shirt! I've even seen one in a polo shirt. The polo shirt was actually invented for tennis, not polo!",9/18/2018 20:24
380,1674," Really always thought it was a polo things, shirts are part of our culture and I guess polo shirts are a classic now",5/28/2000 21:59
380,1674," Yeah, they were invented for tennis player Rene the crocodile Lacoste. Another shirt I like is the Hawaiian shirt. Have yet to see one on a dog. That's the official business attire in Hawaii.",12/19/1992 14:33
380,380," Oh so Lacoste was the inventor, thats really interesting, did you hear about Bill Mays funeral?",6/28/1982 22:21
380,1674," No, I haven't hear about it.",3/4/2016 14:44
380,1674, Apparently the pallbearers wore Blue shirts in his funeral and also khaki pants. ,10/16/1982 15:56
380,380," That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.",2/12/1984 12:08
381,570, I do wear them specially in the winter or when it rains I like to wear sport shoes better but boots can be comfy. ,4/11/1992 7:45
381,570," Yeah, I like them too. I have cozy sweater looking ones for the house. It's getting hot where I am already but we were blessed with another cool day. I'm going to go enjoy the evening, have a good one!",6/12/1990 16:07
381,381," Hello there, are you a dog or a cat person?",7/24/1971 18:25
381,570, I would have to say I am a cat person,6/28/2014 14:52
381,381," I think I am a dog person, but I don't mind cats.  Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?",10/4/2010 14:22
381,381, That is cool.  I heard they also have doggie blood drives too.,2/12/1998 11:15
381,381, Yeah that is super cool!  Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think?,9/23/2019 10:30
381,381," Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color",10/9/1993 12:34
381,570," They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts. ",1/15/1997 3:14
381,381, They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats.,2/10/2016 21:26
382,1217," That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company. ",12/31/1995 3:17
382,1217," Yeah.  I dont know why, but that is how they identify.",12/29/2017 8:25
382,382," Did you know that in Istanbul, they have a vending machine for stray dogs?",9/13/2016 18:52
382,1217, Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat!,8/3/1999 1:38
382,1217," Yeah I think that is really cool, and I know other countries around the world have big stray dog problems. ",5/2/1977 15:50
382,382, I think even one place in Russia dogs are trained on using the subway.,3/9/2000 11:37
382,382, That is incredible.  Did you know the dog was the first species to be domesticated?,5/17/2004 15:40
382,1217," Wow, I didn't know that.  I would have thought it was cats.",7/10/1997 23:03
382,382, Yeah I thought the same thing!,1/2/2018 2:11
382,382, I wonder why dogs seem to chew on shoes so much.,5/27/1980 12:01
383,383," Same here, I know I have had plenty of shoes torn up in my lifetime by dogs!",8/14/1995 13:45
383,1742, Did you know boots are a type of footwear and not a specific shoe?,4/8/2013 12:47
383,383," No, I didn't know that.  It was nice talking to you today, I hope you have a day!",5/18/1988 5:00
383,383, Hello! Do you own any dogs?,6/8/2016 9:15
383,383, I do!  I have one and have had one all my life since I was a kid.,12/6/1979 5:55
383,1742, Oh nice! Me too! Google even prefers dogs to cats lol.,9/2/2020 19:54
383,1742, Nice!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!,7/19/1975 1:33
383,383," Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see!",2/5/1979 17:43
383,383, I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue.,5/22/2008 1:37
383,1742, That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,1/16/1990 17:00
384,681, Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad.,5/18/1978 2:27
384,384, It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy!,3/2/2020 8:14
384,681, Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different.,1/8/2021 4:09
384,681, RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players.,6/21/1977 12:31
384,681, I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons.,7/22/2009 19:12
384,384, That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha.,3/15/1996 19:39
384,681, Yes!  When we're they created?  I think they have been around since the 1800's?,3/12/1985 10:24
384,681, They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!,7/2/2000 13:05
384,384, Nice.  I'm thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it.,6/27/1975 4:06
384,681, That would have been a sight to see! The first person ever to be photographed was actually getting his boots cleaned.,10/22/1980 21:07
385,385," I think I've read about that before and have seen the picture.  I think it was in Paris, France.",7/2/2005 16:13
385,1539," It was, and took place in 1838.",3/6/2021 22:24
385,1539, You should google it.  It's pretty neat.  They are really tiny and didn't know they were in the picture.,6/29/2007 11:11
385,1539, Will do! Have a good one!,10/30/2019 0:06
385,385, Hi do you like to wear shirts?  I do!  I wear them every day.,12/28/1977 7:27
385,1539, I do.  I would be comfortable in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is official business attire.,3/22/2009 21:43
385,385, Wouldn't that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants.,12/28/2014 12:53
385,1539," Yeah, the shirt covers such a broad variety of garments that cover the upper body.  A shirt can also be worn as a necktie.",12/17/1990 2:19
385,385, True.  I've used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol,2/20/2012 22:02
385,385, Is it proper to wear shirts and boots that match?,1/16/1998 6:58
386,386, I would guess so? lol  Do you own a pair of Ugg boots?,6/7/2006 4:03
386,749, I use to back when I was stationed in California and took up surfing.  They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean.,3/19/2007 18:25
386,749, Nice.  I was going to ask if you lived by the ocean. I've never had any even though I live by Lake Michigan.  The Nokia company originally started making rubber boots in the 1800's and they still make them to this day.,1/2/1989 4:22
386,749, I use to live near Lake Michigan.  I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt.  What do you think? ,7/5/2002 19:11
386,749," That's awesome you've been able to see all those places.  The way I see it if you have the chance to where you can wear both at the same time, then go for it.  Life is about have fun right? lol",10/8/1973 15:40
386,749, I suppose.  Talking about having fun.  Did you know that farmers use to put custom boots on their turkeys.  That's just weird! lol,10/30/2012 16:52
386,386, lol That's funny.  I wonder if they did it so they wouldn't get clawed?  My friend had chickens growing up and they had a rooster that was super mean and would go out of it's way to try to claw you.,1/9/1994 11:54
386,386, Need to see if that rooster could take out a dog!  Some roosters have pretty long spikes on their feet.,2/28/1971 3:44
386,749," Oh yeah.  That sucker was mean let me tell you.  I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind!",4/23/1979 18:10
386,749, We could call the bout a  Cock-a-Poodle-Do.  That was bad! lol.  I know dogs aren't color blind but they don't see as many colors as humans do.,7/4/2005 3:25
387,387, LOL That's funny!  Google prefers dogs over cats!  The wrote in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.  It's been fun chatting with you!,1/1/2001 6:22
387,387," Yeah, google is weird that way.  I am a cat person.  Nice talking with you.  Have a nice day!",5/27/1970 22:45
387,1776, Dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.  You have a nice day too!  Thanks for the chat!,2/6/1975 17:16
387,1776, I read that somewhere once.  lol,8/7/2021 19:41
387,387, Cool!  Have a good day!,7/29/1997 3:37
387,387," Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon.",7/28/1970 6:23
387,387," I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY..",6/19/2001 19:42
387,387, I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate.,4/13/1976 9:26
387,1776, Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down. ,3/20/2001 23:08
387,1776," Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting.",4/13/2005 5:52
388,388, I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art!,11/24/1988 4:05
388,1103," Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool.",8/22/1977 16:38
388,388," It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even!",4/26/1997 15:58
388,1103, It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed.,4/22/1973 23:05
388,1103, Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel?,8/5/2001 13:22
388,388, That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute.,6/21/1997 15:23
388,1103," Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though.",2/6/2014 14:16
388,388," Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot.",8/8/1996 7:52
388,388," The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason.",11/8/1980 7:40
388,1103, I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something.,8/31/2008 7:56
389,1486," Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess.",11/23/1977 15:26
389,389, And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition.,8/14/1970 0:12
389,389, She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal.,9/28/1992 9:32
389,389," Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today.",8/31/1994 20:54
389,389," You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal.",4/7/1975 21:28
389,1486, That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move.,12/16/2017 1:15
389,389, I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone?,6/12/2011 5:19
389,1486, Maybe it got passed down to his children.,10/29/1996 11:33
389,389, He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography?,5/1/1974 16:13
389,1486, I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really.,5/14/1983 3:28
390,477, So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes!,8/19/2008 19:11
390,390, That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new.,10/29/1989 4:48
390,390," I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave.",6/2/2004 21:07
390,477, Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans.,1/21/1990 15:00
390,390, I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats.,7/2/1998 12:22
390,477, I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers.,4/17/1984 16:47
390,477," I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else?",4/6/1979 3:11
390,390, Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans.,3/18/2022 11:56
390,390, It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though.,10/11/2000 9:57
390,477, And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience.,11/18/1996 11:00
391,719, To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an idol like culture is mind boggling.,12/18/1999 20:31
391,719," Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back.",2/19/2020 4:51
391,391," Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you.",1/30/1981 14:14
391,391, It is like they control every part of their lives. That would  be very hard especially if they are young.,7/10/1985 16:02
391,719," Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless.",12/16/2005 23:22
391,719, I think so .,1/1/1973 11:05
391,719, Do you like to dance? ,8/4/2004 16:28
391,391, I do sometimes even though I am terrible haha. How about you?,9/10/1974 17:24
391,391, I'm terrible also. Hilarious!,7/27/1978 2:06
391,391," We should have taken lessons from Bruce Lee when we had the chance, or were alive way back then lol.",8/26/1981 5:16
392,1877," Yeah, I heard he was a great dancer. Apparently Tupac was pretty good too. ",6/12/2012 2:55
392,1877, Yea he portrayed the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker in high school for ballet!,11/11/1981 23:17
392,1877," Hilarious, I know he used to be a backup dancer for Digital Underground. ",2/5/2002 21:41
392,392," Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that's what my parents said). It's crazy how natural dancing is!",9/19/1994 5:28
392,1877, Hilarious. I didn't know that babies did that. ,8/4/1970 17:57
392,392, I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That's the Korean music craze going on now!,10/1/1970 16:23
392,392," Yeah, that is pretty funny. I'm not sure, MJ had a patent on dance moves though. ",9/16/1983 18:11
392,1877, I remember seeing a video on that. It allowed him to achieve an extreme lean on his dance moves?,11/10/1996 3:00
392,1877," yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds? ",11/25/1986 12:40
392,392, I think birds are crazy lol. It's cool their entire skeleton weights less than their feathers!,8/4/2013 2:52
393,393," yeah, that is pretty cool isn't it. What about hummingbirds, do you know anything about them? ",7/3/2017 18:55
393,828," I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol.",9/1/1985 23:59
393,828, That is pretty scary. I wonder what noises birds in australia make? ,12/13/1999 17:20
393,393," I think they've learned to make sounds like cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That would be weird to hear huh?",9/19/2021 8:24
393,828," Yeah, that is pretty weird isn't it? I wonder if it is true. Well, nice chatting with you. ",1/2/2022 2:24
393,393, I will have to check that out. Nice chatting with you as well!,7/13/1987 0:06
393,828, Take it easy. ,9/11/2011 0:27
393,393, Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do? ,7/2/2009 22:44
393,828, I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.  ,11/26/2004 7:59
393,393, Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game. ,2/18/1987 2:08
394,1059, They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there!,1/7/1987 8:07
394,394, Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada. ,7/28/1978 14:48
394,1059, That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine!,10/13/1992 11:27
394,1059," Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games. ",6/16/2020 5:47
394,394, Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats?,12/26/2002 21:32
394,394," Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you? ",5/1/2022 3:10
394,394," Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like!",11/4/1979 5:02
394,394," Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties. ",4/18/2013 7:17
394,394, Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque!,6/13/1998 2:39
394,1059, Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard.,7/7/1983 19:22
395,845, Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998!,8/22/1974 14:35
395,845, Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?  ,10/5/1994 2:12
395,845, Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness!,8/1/1971 10:04
395,845, I think that's really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons. ,5/9/1985 10:10
395,395, Wow sounded dangerous!  Did you know Dunce caps were worn to encourage foolish behavior?,11/19/1972 15:39
395,395, Well that's must be were the term originated. You know panda researcher wear panda suits to work. ,5/31/1995 5:35
395,845," I did not know that, but sounds fun!  Any who, was nice chatting with ya!",12/30/1991 0:26
395,845, You also have a great day!! In parting I tip my hat to you my friend.,6/23/1984 6:56
395,845, Hello,8/19/1997 7:26
395,845," Hello, how are you? Do you like baseball?",6/10/2018 16:09
396,396, I enjoy it. It is such a fun fast paced game to watch. Do you like it?,8/17/2008 5:39
396,396, I do enjoy baseball. There is nothing like going to a ball game. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they can technically can play if there is a need for it?,12/16/2001 23:31
396,396, Really? I wouldn't have guessed that looking at most of the managers. They don't seem quite as in shape as most of the players on the team. ,10/23/1990 9:32
396,396," Haha, I agree. It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars!",6/19/2011 16:14
396,1763, Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. ,3/12/2020 10:17
396,1763," I couldn't even imagine, I would be so shocked. In japan baseball is very popular, and they are surprised to hear it;s status as america's national pastime?",2/14/1995 16:13
396,396, I wonder why they were surprised. Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states. Maybe because we are so synonomous with football?,8/17/1982 21:30
396,1763, What is your favorite team?,12/28/2012 11:34
396,396, I guess if I had to pick I would go with the twins. They are a pretty decent team. I wonder if there was any twins cards in that guys 3 million dollar find.,9/24/1978 10:29
396,1763," Maybe, that must of been so cool to find them.",6/6/1998 14:05
397,397, I would be so excited to find something like that just sitting in my family's attic. Since they were from the 40's there had to be some amazing cards in there. ,12/22/2001 14:05
397,397, Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.,4/14/2004 23:46
397,397, Not really unless kids costumes count. I always thought hats were super neat. They have such a long and rich history. ,1/16/1979 19:28
397,1192," Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.",1/10/1989 13:36
397,1192, That is a neat fact! I love that people always associate the cowboy hat with the old west but really it was the bowler that was the favorite of the time. ,3/11/2011 12:14
397,1192, That is true. The party hat originates from dunce caps... they were worn at parties to encourage a more foolish behavior!,5/31/1979 2:20
397,397, That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening. ,5/3/2004 15:45
397,397, You as well. Take care.,12/27/2016 1:17
397,397, Bye,7/10/1999 21:52
397,397," Hi, how are you doing today?",2/22/1997 4:50
398,398, Good. Do you watch baseball? Back in August the nationals traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams before a game,2/21/1994 12:54
398,398, Sometimes I follow baseball. Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake?,3/9/2005 3:08
398,398," I don't think so, they weren't doing too good in the standings plus they're stadium was half empty",11/19/1983 9:45
398,930," I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild.",10/10/1979 21:09
398,930," Yea they weren't doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies",8/21/1976 8:19
398,398," I think it's tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well.",1/29/1995 18:43
398,398," Yea and the fans weren't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite",4/20/2012 13:14
398,930, Did he sell enough tickets though? Probably most fans would want a winning team. ,4/1/1989 23:29
398,930," Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play",3/8/2015 5:02
398,930," That's a funny rule, isn't it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager.",12/31/2018 7:03
399,490," Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too",11/29/1980 21:05
399,399, Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though. ,7/2/1998 13:28
399,490, Yea that's not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather's attic,12/29/1992 19:29
399,399," That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment.",11/20/2007 9:02
399,399, I'd take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular,6/27/1982 12:59
399,399," The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it's a difference experience at the stadium. It's an interesting lesson in cultural difference.",8/17/2019 6:35
399,490," I'd like to visit England too, it's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons",2/22/2012 16:26
399,399, I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition. The old guard wants politicians in top hats and managers in player uniforms.,1/4/1994 17:01
399,490, And Johnny Depp wears his Jack Sparrow costume to make visits to hospitals,11/7/1981 16:42
399,490, He really does his best for the kids. I like that he's willing to make some kid's day better. ,11/11/2015 22:14
400,400," He is a good person. Well I got to go, nice talking with you",5/7/1998 22:48
400,400, do you like baseball?,1/9/2020 5:58
400,400, Yes I do. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,6/19/2007 14:24
400,400, Yes because they can play of the team needs them to,1/5/1989 19:48
400,400, Yeah. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,11/8/1977 19:42
400,400, Yes it is called soccer-baseball,7/16/2022 23:43
400,400, Yeah I guess it makes sense because it has elements from both games,7/2/2018 20:24
400,400, Yeah true. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule for 24 years?,4/2/2016 14:40
400,608, Yes it was a couple who scheduled all games each year ,6/11/1996 10:33
400,400, That is impressive. Do you wear hats at all?,3/6/2010 7:26
401,401, sometimes. In the UK they hat to wear top hats to make a point in the House of COmmons,1/28/1996 10:30
401,998, Cool. DO you know which was the most popular hat in the old west?,1/1/2005 10:29
401,998, contrary to common belief it was not the cowboy hat but the bowler hat,7/27/1994 19:43
401,998, I know right? Do you know where the tipping of the hat originated from,1/30/1993 7:23
401,401, Yes that was from back then when the knights lifted their visors to show friendliness,5/14/1986 0:31
401,998, Yeah. DO you know the origins of the conical party hat?,3/22/1999 22:06
401,401, Yes that was from the dunce hat that encouraged foolish behavior ,5/21/2007 21:27
401,401, Haha crazy. DO you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes?,7/20/1995 0:01
401,998, Yes so pandas do not feel threatened I think. Did you know Sean Bean is scared of flying?,3/24/2020 2:49
401,998, Yeah so much that he once hiked in a full costume to the filming site,8/31/1977 22:15
402,402, WOw dedication and fear. Johnny Depp visits kids in hospitals wearing the Jack Sparrow costume,4/6/2013 9:19
402,402, That must be so uplifting for the kids,4/29/1971 12:22
402,260," Hello, how do you do?",2/7/1976 4:21
402,402," hello, I'm alright!  Have you seen the new Christopher Robin movie?  I heard it was really for the whole family.  I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day! I thought that line was funny.",1/29/1983 17:05
402,260," I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own",12/6/1971 19:00
402,260," Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him..",9/28/2010 13:59
402,402, That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books,12/21/1989 22:25
402,260," I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL",10/29/1974 5:43
402,402, Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide,7/24/1976 2:27
402,260," Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide.",5/2/2000 5:02
403,403," While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours",8/22/2021 8:43
403,403," Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look.",1/17/1970 20:28
403,409, I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster's ghost regrets not buying netflix,2/5/1991 15:43
403,403," Ha, yeah!  I'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!  ",6/22/1981 20:57
403,409, I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment,11/18/1995 9:43
403,403," Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)  Get PAID to watch Netflix?  Where do I sign up for that?  LOL",10/27/2016 17:44
403,409, That does sound nice. I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers?,7/22/2005 17:56
403,409," Ha, we could only hope!  Course, if I had Netflix it wouldn't be just for the movies and tv shows, I think I'd try some of their original programming as well.  For instance, I heard the show Stranger Things was really good. Have you seen that one?  ",12/21/2018 0:53
403,403," I have not, but I have heard good things about their original content lately.",3/14/2000 13:43
403,403," Course, there's so many subscription services it's getting ridiculous.  Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, heck even Disney is coming out (or has it already?) with one for all their movies and properties.  ",2/24/2019 12:37
404,404, Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so it is understandable. All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service,8/4/2002 13:05
404,960," Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind.",8/29/1973 9:17
404,960," That is amazing. Disney sure has come a long way and while you don't really think of disney as a media company and more of a amusement park and animation studio, it is the largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue",11/6/2006 12:26
404,404," I think it's crazy when you think about just how much STUFF they own now.  I mean, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, the theme parks.  It's like they're trying to completely take over the world!  (laughs nervously)",4/27/1987 23:28
404,404," I agree it is the time of big corporations. I wonder if the tv show where the earth is ruled by corporations instead of countries will come to pass? In any case, thank you for the wonderful chat.",5/16/2003 7:54
404,960, hi friend,9/17/2002 7:36
404,960, Hello! Hope you're having a good day.,8/1/1981 12:10
404,404, thank you friend do you like this topic,11/3/2005 23:29
404,960, Do you mean the film Christopher Robin? I enjoyed it very much. Have you seen it?,2/11/2004 21:39
404,404, iam really enjoyed for chat for you and you happy  chating for me,8/2/2022 10:38
405,334," Thank you! I find it fascinating that the original Winnie-the-Pooh books were based on a real boy, the author's son. Did you know that?",11/21/2018 14:02
405,405, yes i know this books is so great,5/21/1980 15:33
405,334, I agree! And I loved how the Christopher Robin movie brought the characters to live through a mix of live action and computer animation.,11/20/1979 8:22
405,405, yes in this book is so interesting character also and nice book,6/29/1971 10:34
405,334, Do you have a favorite Winnie-the-Pooh character?,1/3/1989 9:28
405,405, is good k tell for you boring character for this book ,8/7/2021 23:03
405,405," That's fine. We can't all like the same things, right? My favorite is Eeyore.",9/14/1973 1:20
405,334, yes l like you answer,12/12/1971 22:34
405,334," Thank you! Hey, did you know the Christopher Robin movie was made by The Walt Disney Company?",4/26/2020 7:23
405,334, OK you most favorite for other anyone books,7/26/1977 22:32
406,1909," Sure! I know Disney publishes a lot of books every year, too. It's a huge corporation.",6/24/1997 6:16
406,1909, i like some Disney books,10/28/2006 21:55
406,406, What are some of your favorites?,8/29/2004 12:06
406,406, iam always  like  action story is my favorite ,3/27/2007 13:04
406,406," I enjoy action stories, too. Do you like action movies as well? I've seen some great ones on Netflix.",12/31/1980 22:45
406,406, yes i watch for more than action movies for Netflix ,1/27/2014 21:28
406,406, I really love Netflix's streaming service. It's so convenient! What's the last movie you watched on Netflix?,8/15/2004 8:27
406,1909, yes you are really correct friend Netflix is good for always,11/7/1998 0:32
406,406," Absolutely. Hey, friend, I've got to run, but it was great talking to you!",1/27/2005 4:56
406,1909, thank you friend i really happy for talking for you,4/9/2015 5:42
407,313, Hope you have a great day! Bye!,12/26/1991 6:56
407,313, Do you enjoy movies?,8/23/1978 6:27
407,407," Yes, I do.  Do you?",8/15/1971 20:11
407,407, Do you usually watch them on netflix or at the theater?,5/20/1990 6:35
407,313," I used to watch movies at the theater a lot, but nowadays it's usually on Netflix.",3/29/2012 4:50
407,313, What you watched any walt disney films of late?,1/24/2013 4:03
407,407, I recently watched Christopher Robin with Ewan McGregor.  Have you seen it?,4/11/1978 7:53
407,313, I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right?,7/9/1998 0:47
407,313," Yeah, that's the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in.",3/7/2018 17:49
407,407," I think it's plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner",5/6/1994 20:26
408,634," Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you're interested.",4/5/2006 16:04
408,408, Sweet. It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh,10/17/1986 12:17
408,408, Is that true?  I hadn't heard about that.,1/1/2003 3:46
408,634, Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would rather have a father than a child's story,9/14/1993 5:03
408,408," Wow!  That's really interesting!  I can understand that.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't really address any of that.  That would have been cool to know as just a side bit of info while watching.",2/26/1974 5:55
408,634," Well regardless of how the real Christoper felt, it is hard to deny the place of winnie the pooh in the hearts of millions of children and adults today",2/23/2020 3:04
408,634, True.  Disney really hit it big getting to make that movie.  ,8/4/1992 4:28
408,634, Well disney has always done a good job in making great movies that are appealing to both children and adults,4/12/1996 14:04
408,408, Yeah for sure.  Mickey and Minerva Mouse have sure laid the groundwork for many decades of great entertainment!,7/1/2008 22:15
408,408, True. I mean there is even a whole subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse references in all things disney,6/18/1970 6:45
409,409, Do you think there actually is Mickey in every disney film?  Do you think that applies to Pixar too?,11/27/2007 19:15
409,382," Yes I do. People love their easter eggs. In any case, thanks for taking the time to chat.",3/5/2002 13:04
409,409," Hi. how are you, this morning?",5/29/1980 6:37
409,382," I'm doing well, how are you? Do you have kids, if so do you watch Cupcake and Dino? ",9/2/1981 16:59
409,382," Doing good, thanks.  No kids here, but what is Cupcake and Dino?",4/3/1981 22:45
409,382," Apparently it is a kids show, but I've never seen it. Maybe it is a movie. ",4/29/1987 17:36
409,382, Have you seen the Christopher Robin film?  I was wondering how it was.,12/20/2004 9:00
409,382," No, I didn't. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor. ",4/30/1990 14:27
409,382," Yes, he is.  I didn't go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a kids movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child.",7/18/1983 3:14
409,409, It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy? ,1/17/1972 17:26
410,1144," I heard that he was the author's son in real life.  That's so cool, talk about having a book written about you.",11/3/1991 20:57
410,410, I don't know if I could handle that to be honest.,11/3/1992 14:53
410,410," Me either. Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear.  I saw it once on a school trip, it looked old and raggedy.",7/21/2000 22:48
410,1144, I didn't know that. So they still have it? ,3/16/2022 18:26
410,410," Yes, they do. It's hard to believe that toy bear hasn't fallen apart, yet. It's like WW I era, that's old. ",1/18/1991 4:28
410,1144, That's pretty cool. I wonder if they offer the movie on Netflix? ,11/25/2006 13:35
410,410," They probably do, I'm going to look for it and watch it, if they do.",4/11/1991 3:03
410,1144, Apparently netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. ,9/5/1985 23:33
410,410, That I can totally see.  And the other half is on Facebook.. lol,11/24/1977 2:55
410,1144," I believe it, although you have to wonder how much of that is actually instagram? ",4/11/2022 8:10
411,436, How true.  I heard that Blockbuster had several chances to buy Netflix and didn't.  Big mistake on their part.,10/22/1983 17:24
411,411," I believe it, although you don't know if they would have ran it as successfully. ",7/4/2009 11:53
411,436," That's true.  Well, it's been nice talking with you, I'll see you around.",9/24/1992 19:15
411,411," Hi there, do you enjoy poetry?",2/18/2009 23:14
411,411, No I really don't.I don't understand it and find it boring.,5/1/2008 15:55
411,411," Oh I see. Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa",11/9/2018 16:49
411,436," there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words",8/23/2006 5:01
411,436," I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem",8/12/1970 17:08
411,411, the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ?,11/11/2009 22:08
411,436, Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven. Not is is priceless,3/14/1973 12:46
412,412, isn't that always the way? things don't become priceless until the person is dead. baltimore must be the place for poetry! first edgar allen poe and also tupac ,5/23/1997 8:11
412,107," Yeah it seems that way. On another topic, do you like dogs?",9/30/1996 22:48
412,107, Lol these really arent my favorite subjects. I am not a dog fan.,11/9/1996 22:28
412,107," Oh I see. But just for curiosity, they have 12 blood types, way more than we do",9/21/1979 21:44
412,412, they can also reason better than chimps,8/12/1982 20:11
412,412," Seem lie it since they understand pointing, same as elephants",7/21/2013 11:01
412,412, they enjoy solving a problem,3/23/2015 20:33
412,412, Yeah that too. Even Google has declared itself as a dog company,3/27/1977 20:28
412,107, im guessing with that they allow employees to bring dogs to work? I can't ever figure out what makes them a dog compnay,2/1/1993 18:04
412,107, Well maybe and they have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company,6/26/1972 22:14
413,413, russia must really be into dogs they have a tomb of the unknown dog AND some of their dogs have learned to use the subway,1/5/2004 21:54
413,1116, Wow that is impressive. For a long time I thought that dogs were colorblind but apprently they just do not see as many colors as we do,5/20/1997 2:58
413,413, and they can learn over 1000 words. I guess thats why they make them service dogs,8/12/2005 17:45
413,413," Yeah, it makes sense. Nice chat",10/9/2012 10:08
413,413, Which city is home to Netflix?,12/11/1982 13:16
413,1116, I've heard it's from Los Gatos in California. Do you use Netflix?,6/10/1989 6:35
413,413, Yes.    I heard they have a lot of users worldwide.    Do you know how many?,8/18/2013 16:09
413,413," I don't, but I use it to watch a few shows. What kind of stuff do you watch on it?",8/4/1977 22:36
413,413, I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix.    Can you believe that film inspired the whole service!,7/7/1977 18:41
413,1116, No kidding? I had no idea! It's amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others.,1/17/2001 15:08
414,414," Nothing to do with the film, but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it!",6/10/2011 15:05
414,414," Hah, I guess cinematography isn't everything. I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee. If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations!",3/4/2005 18:17
414,1350, True.    I do like cinematography though.     It is amazing what can come from a lens and light.,2/4/1973 15:06
414,1350," Cinematography is so fascinating. It's like an intersection of physics and visual art, because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work.",12/12/2002 7:21
414,1350," True, but it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel.",1/20/2000 2:11
414,414, I can't pretend to understand all the technology behind it. It's like magic in a way.,12/26/1982 13:29
414,414," OK.    I guess ultimately it is about the people behind it, like James Wong Howe who won an Oscar.",4/24/1972 2:03
414,414, Do you know what movie he won for?,12/13/2008 23:29
414,414," I do not know, but he frequently used a crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography to create his style.",2/8/2008 8:54
414,1350, I wonder why some people have such a gift for cinematography. They seem to be able to picture things in their minds that make such a visual impact even though others wouldn't imagine it beforehand.,8/8/1970 16:21
415,415," Very True.     Stanley Kubrick had a vision and took the camera from his cinematographer, but allowed him to keep the credit.",8/5/1992 11:47
415,435," I would be awfully annoyed if I were that cinematographer, haha. First I can't do my job, then I get credit for something I didn't even do!",12/29/1977 22:56
415,415," I suppose, but the oscar and residuals from Spartacus probably help!",12/22/1998 6:32
415,435," That's true. I wouldn't mind getting paid for not having to do my job either, and as a cinematographer, he probably had a lot of appreciation for seeing Oscar-worthy work done in front of him by Kubrick.",3/7/2022 5:22
415,435, Perhaps the Internet Movie Database IMDb should create a new category for things like this!,1/23/1992 1:15
415,435, That would be a great new addition. I use IMDB to look up moves and actors/actresses all the time.,8/28/2015 21:43
415,415, Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the Billionaire Boys Club movie?,9/29/1996 14:07
415,415," I haven't seen it, actually. Is it any good?",8/27/1978 6:13
415,415," I haven't. I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think.",7/2/1970 2:48
415,415," I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become",10/14/2021 12:22
416,186," Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?",5/29/2021 1:29
416,186," I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster",4/16/1970 10:47
416,186, Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night.,11/1/1972 14:08
416,416," I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there's no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America",6/14/1976 11:30
416,416, I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental.,10/29/1971 1:17
416,186," I would be annoyed about a rental fee that's higher than it costs for the VHS. It's still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn't always the best in some places",8/20/2003 1:53
416,416, Yes I think maybe it's from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time.,1/27/1973 18:45
416,416," Netflix is capable of streaming on more than one device at the same time depending on the subscription. Either way, it's still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix",8/14/2012 22:47
416,416," Of course. I think some wifi can't handle that, though. Yes, I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix. It was for much lower of a price than it's worth now, too!",9/12/1980 17:37
416,186, I think their value went up once they started creating their own content. It's part of the appeal now to keep users loyal,1/7/2015 9:18
417,156," Yes, Netflix creating their own content seems like it's part of a cinematography revolution or something!",12/7/1984 22:57
417,417," Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins, his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins. Losing 13 times would be hard",5/20/1972 8:28
417,417," Yes, that would be hard. On the bright side, I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years!",4/17/2009 9:11
417,417," Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s. He was Chinese before finally becoming a citizen, but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular",7/15/1987 6:04
417,156, Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer. One of my favorites is Stanely Kubrick. He did Spartacus.,3/25/1992 23:50
417,417," I've heard of him, though he didn't get the credit for his work. Sounds like a stand-up guy though",5/24/1986 9:31
417,417," Well I guess he's usually considered a producer, but he did a lot of the work on Spartacus. He is a cool guy...you should look up an interview of his.",10/4/1974 15:55
417,417, Have you ever been on a blind date?,6/30/1983 2:28
417,417, No but I heard blind dates can be quite successful and lead to marriage,12/24/2018 9:19
417,417, I did too and people rate them on a 1-5 scale. Do you think people care about their date's shoes?,10/7/1995 17:48
418,1471," I think women tend to care more about the shoes then men, men tend to only care more about function than style",11/13/2007 4:34
418,1471, Did you know that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? I hope they're not too expensive!,10/17/1984 12:48
418,418, That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels,4/10/1984 17:58
418,1471, That's pretty cool! I like that Steve Smith leaves his cleats every game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes.,9/24/2013 2:03
418,1471," Yea, that is very thoughtful. Did you know in the 9th century Persian Cavalry soldiers wore high-heeled shoes>",9/21/1993 5:30
418,418, I can't imagine soldiers in high heels! Another thing I can't imagine because it's portrayed differently is that pilgrims wore tons of colorful clothes and black only for special occasions?,6/8/1974 20:13
418,418, I never knew that but there are still African tribes that wear old Victorian clothing so anythings possible,6/9/2022 11:55
418,1471, Me either.  Did you know Apple had a clothing line 1986? I thought they only did technology...,8/16/1991 10:33
418,418," Well there are some odd clothing compaines, Miguel Cabarello makes bulletproof clothings",12/21/1990 6:30
418,418, I wonder if that is extra heavy? I would love to visit the store in Alabama that sells clothes etc from unclaimed baggage at the airport. I bet there's some interesting things.,6/18/1987 15:37
419,1373," Speaking of airport clothing, a man in China once wore 70 clothing items just to avoid bagging fees",5/19/2000 9:30
419,419," Well the fees are getting high on some airlines! I wonder how much it happens that a label says made somewhere, but is really made elsewhere like with Rip Curl?",5/10/1984 21:43
419,1373, Probably a lot. Did you know at Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis?,4/13/2004 3:28
419,1373, I would love to see a gang in America layer shirts with popped collars like they did in China!,11/29/2008 13:53
419,419," Lol, sounds better than Mark Zuckerburgs plain shirts that cost $300-$400",2/18/1972 13:27
419,1373, That's crazy! It would be nice to have business attire be an aloha shirt like in Hawaii. I would be much more comfortable.,10/18/1973 20:50
419,1373, Yea that sounds much more comfortable than a blue shirt and khakis,11/19/1976 11:06
419,419, I agree! Have a great night!,1/25/2003 23:26
419,419," Hello,  do you like shoes?",10/30/1970 17:32
419,419," I do, only have a few pairs but I do like them, what about you?",9/12/2000 12:17
420,1782," Yes,  I love shoes.  Did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week!",4/5/1989 23:56
420,420," I didnt, the must spend a fortune in shoes, there are 17 wayts to tie shoes!!",2/26/1978 19:39
420,420," wow,  I only know 3 lol ",2/25/1974 1:46
420,420," I know the one lol, do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?",6/9/2000 20:33
420,420, Yeah definitely!,5/21/1989 21:55
420,1782," Ok so apparently he holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes, seems like he is a fan of ballet or just a science guy that stumbled into a great invention",9/16/1984 21:56
420,420," wow really.  that seems weird lol did you know putting dry tea bads in smelly shoes or gm bads will absorb the unpleasant odor. This actually works really well, we put it in our snowboard boots lol ",8/15/1987 10:14
420,1782," Yeah that sounds really weird, do you keep up with fashion? ",9/20/1989 2:47
420,420, not really lol I just buy whatever looks good on me. ,4/29/2021 13:12
420,1782," I see, well Tshirts were invented back in 1904,directed to bachelors actually",2/28/2011 10:35
421,421, Oh really that is interesting. The official business attire in hawaii is that aloha shirt. ,12/5/1978 18:00
421,134," That is interesting as well, do you know Mark Zuckerberg, he always wears grey shirts, they seem simple but they actually cost around 300-400 dollars each",6/11/1970 15:55
421,421, lol no I didnt I havent noticed. ,1/20/1998 14:40
421,134," They seem like a regular $10 t-shirt but yeah they are worth a lot of money, ",7/24/2002 14:05
421,421," Thats interesting,  maybe he like a certain brand or whatever.  Did you know Polo shirts were invented for tennis players?",5/30/1985 4:31
421,421," Really? by tennis players? the name doesnt serve them justice, Polo takes all the credit lol",7/29/2019 10:06
421,421, lol so weird right,6/23/2017 22:56
421,421," I know right, did you know a chinese man wore 70 items of clothing to avoid the bagging charge, that must have been funny to watch",9/16/1988 13:13
421,421, Wow I wonder how much the baggage charge wouldve been lol that doesnt seem worth it.  ,4/28/2004 19:26
421,134," Maybe he had no money left lol, sounds like a lot of trouble only to avoid paying a fee, there is bulletproof clothing called mogul",3/4/1974 8:48
422,150, Its been good chatting. ,10/22/2018 6:18
422,422, How are you today.,7/24/1972 11:19
422,422, Well thank you. Do you have any hobbies?,7/29/1990 7:07
422,150, Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you?,8/30/2002 6:05
422,150," I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon. ",7/24/2014 14:11
422,422, Wow that's taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times.,6/2/2003 0:54
422,150," Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior",11/22/1990 22:49
422,422, The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian. ,9/8/1982 22:44
422,150," Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices?",5/2/1985 8:02
422,422, One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa. ,11/21/2001 12:08
423,423," Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation.",10/8/1973 1:14
423,423, Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one.,9/16/1983 18:02
423,423," To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit's character names are derived from the poem dvergatal",6/10/1993 14:49
423,423, Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs?,9/11/2004 3:45
423,1107," Who doesn't? I think that humans can bond with most animals, even crocs, but the level of intimacy is different from that of dogs since dogs and humans have evolved side by side to be better attuned to one another",8/16/2004 17:19
423,1107, I agree for instance did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and they donate blood?,6/14/1994 18:49
423,423, I did. I was surprised I never thought about animals donating bird before I learned that fact,10/1/1994 23:43
423,423, Apparently google prefers dogs to cats.,7/28/1975 13:11
423,1107, Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day?,11/11/1982 19:05
423,1107, Apparently they've even written it into their code of conduct.,6/2/1991 4:51
424,361, Well I guess Google simply acknowledges that dogs are man's best friend,8/25/1976 8:13
424,361, I always believed that dogs were color blind but that's not entirely true. ,1/16/1980 10:24
424,361, I think they can only see less colors like blue and yellow,10/8/2008 13:23
424,361, Yeah they can't see as many colors as we can. Nice chatting with you.,1/16/2013 16:22
424,361," Hi, how are you?",5/10/1977 2:40
424,361," Im great, do you know who Mariah Carey is?",1/18/2009 3:03
424,361, I do. Do you like her music?,12/1/2000 5:11
424,361," Yeah she has some decent songs, Glitter is one of my favorites and  Pet Semaraty is also good",6/8/2002 23:34
424,424, Did you ever see her Cribs episode on MTV? She is super-extra!,4/26/2017 1:28
424,361," No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music?",8/27/2010 18:55
425,425, I do like pop music. Did you know Ariana Grande got hit by a puck twice in one game?,5/2/1975 12:25
425,414," I didn't know that, that is odd lol, twice in a game? she must have a puck magnet in her forehead.",7/6/2003 6:11
425,414," Yeah, it just was on twitter or Apple news this past weekend. There's a picture of her sitting on a zamboni too!",7/3/1994 8:18
425,425," I guess there's a lot of controversy because of that, do you like snakes?",1/24/1976 8:40
425,414, No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?,1/20/1981 5:35
425,425," I have a healthy respect for them and would scream like a little girl if I ever saw one next to me lol, they are interesting animals though",12/20/2002 0:48
425,414," My 7 year old asked if he could get one and I tried to act cool, like I wasn't completely afraid of the notion! I was cool as a cucumber...",6/7/2014 23:03
425,425, And did you bought you r7 year old a snake lol?,2/26/2011 0:51
425,414, Nope! He got a cat. And I hate that thing. It's the worst cat ever. He just scratches and pees everywhere. JERK!,9/21/1990 1:25
425,425," I agree im more of a dog person myself, maybe a snake was a better choice I would be afraid but I wouldnt worry about scratches and pee",11/26/1996 23:54
426,426, Yeah. She is going to a farm in the spring. That's not code. OUr friend has a farm and some barn cats so she will be relocated there.,3/24/1985 11:05
426,426," I see, well interesting fact about snakes, sometimes they are born with two heads and both head end up fighting for food.",7/12/2007 17:13
426,426, That's really weird. Bite the head to spite the stomach!,5/11/1995 3:00
426,799, Yeah and also 70% of the snakes lay eggs others give live birth another surprising fact.,6/5/1978 21:37
426,426, Gross. Nice chatting with you!,1/7/1984 22:28
426,426, Do you listen to Mariah Carey? ,6/22/2003 5:55
426,426," I do, I have been a fan of the All I want for Christmas is You.  ",5/15/1991 13:20
426,799, That was a good album. I'm not sure if she has released anything recently though.,6/30/1980 2:49
426,426," I dont know either, she does have an incredible vocal range though.  No other singer really has matched her there.",8/29/2009 6:12
426,426, Do you think she will go on tour soon? ,3/15/1984 0:09
427,427," I'm not sure, but I know Glitter has gone to the top of the charts recently",6/12/2016 20:09
427,427, Is that her new album? I wonder if it is doing better than Linkin Parks Hybrid theory.,4/14/1992 3:36
427,427," It is one of hers, but not better than Linkin Park's that was the best selling album of all time.",9/14/1997 3:58
427,427," Apparently, NWA's album was the first to reach platinum status without the support of airplay. ",7/2/1999 0:57
427,1904," That is pretty incredible, now musicians have it much easier as distribution of music is easier, you dont have to go to the store to buy things anymore.",3/29/1993 23:52
427,427," Yeah, with Youtube and things like that. Do you own any snakes? ",6/21/2014 20:44
427,1904," Nope.  Im like New Zeland, no snakes.  But I do have some friends who own them.",3/18/1989 19:16
427,427," Interesting, I didn't know there were no snakes in new Zealand. ",6/23/2006 17:41
427,1904," Im now sure why, maybe all the other animals ate them or something.  Have you heard of those flying snakes that can launch themselves at their prey?  That would be totally creepy",4/9/2010 19:50
427,1904," No, do they have wings? ",2/17/2004 3:35
428,428," I dont know, all that I imagine is kind of like this cartoon character I saw once, Trogdor, That is what I think of.  ",8/23/1985 11:30
428,552," Well, did you know there are legless lizards that aren't snakes? ",7/29/2000 12:45
428,552, Really?  Thats kind of crazy.  I wonder if they have the paired organs like snakes do.,11/13/1983 3:03
428,552," I'm not sure, but at least they don't fly like some snakes!",7/26/1989 0:22
428,552, If I ever ran into one of those flying snakes I dont know what I would do.  The fear of snakes is hard wired into both human and monkey brains.,3/30/2017 22:32
428,552," Yeah, they can be scary looking creatures, that is for sure. ",2/2/2019 21:53
428,428, Hey there!  Are you a Beatles fan?,10/19/2001 3:12
428,552," Good evening, why yes, I am.  Are you?",3/9/2020 20:22
428,428, Who was your favorite Beatle?  Think I like Ringo just 'cause he's kinda goofy.,5/18/1990 13:41
428,552, George Harrison was my favorite.,11/13/1975 11:52
429,85, Cool.  Most people tend to say John or Paul.  Probably because they were the primary songwriters.  You have a favorite song?,12/26/2012 20:38
429,85," She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool!",5/8/2019 23:13
429,429, One of the songs I like is Come Together. Did you know it was actually written for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign?  ,10/19/2012 17:13
429,85, I didn't know that.  Interesting.,9/15/1975 10:33
429,429, Another one I like is A Hard Days Night.  Think I relate to the line that goes And I've been working like a dog. 1) Because I'm overworked and 2) because I'm a dog person. You like dogs?,1/16/1998 10:20
429,429," Yes, I am a dog person.  Good segue, by the way.  I have 2.  Do you have any?",11/24/1998 8:41
429,429, Don't have any but my kids keep bugging me for one.  They keep reminding me they're man's best friend! Thinking that will make me think it'll be easier to take care of.  What kind of dogs do you have?,5/27/2016 6:08
429,85, I have a 12 year old yellow lab and a 10 year old yorkie/ poodle mix and they are the best and are truly man's best friend!,6/28/1992 0:28
429,85, How good are they at taking directions?  Heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,7/19/1989 1:27
429,85, Both of them are very smart and understand pointing and are better behaved than many children I see in stores.,11/4/2020 22:00
430,1168, Ha!  My husband use to volunteer for an organization that trained service dogs for aiding the disabled.  Think they were labradoodles.  He said they were very smart.  ,2/2/2006 1:50
430,1168," I used to think that my dogs saw in black and white but i have since learned that they aren't color blind and in fact can see colors, just not as many as a human.",10/2/1978 8:19
430,430, That's pretty interesting.  Wonder what colors they can see!  My daughter so desperately wants a dog she spent an afternoon writing a poem about why she deserves a dog.  A for effort. Lots of rhyming like Dr. Seuss.  ,1/26/1975 13:44
430,1168," Oh, get that baby a doggie.  Every kid needs a dog, it'll help teach her responsibility and accountability. Speaking of poetry, do you like it?",8/13/2002 4:10
430,430," Yeah, those were some of her arguments.  Kinda dreaded learning the classics.  I remember having to memorize The Raven.",5/6/1985 3:41
430,430," Funny, I remember that one, as well as Anabelle Lee.  You know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9.00 for The Raven?",9/28/2007 13:52
430,1168, Dang!  No wonder he wrote a lot of depressing stuff. Great chatting with you.  Give your dogs a hug for me and I'll consider getting my kids a dog.  Take care!,9/15/1996 23:34
430,1168," You too, friend.  Enjoy the rest of your night!",11/5/1986 9:31
430,1168," Hey, do you care a lot about fashion? ",1/9/2009 1:50
430,430, Yes I know a lot about clothing actually. In fact I'm wearing some right now LOL what about you,4/5/2021 9:24
431,1458, I know a decent amount although I do not care the most about fashion. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986?,7/6/2020 9:44
431,1458," No I didn't know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They're probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions",12/31/2015 1:44
431,1458," I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me.",6/2/1975 4:20
431,431, A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea,3/7/1999 9:28
431,431, I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea!,3/18/1983 7:24
431,1458," Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn't buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there's a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff",10/29/1972 21:41
431,431, Really? I would not trust that store. Professional Ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week!,9/30/1999 13:20
431,431, That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes,2/24/1985 18:39
431,431," I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience",1/8/2012 11:29
431,1458," They probably smell bad because they're so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL",5/8/1988 22:26
432,432, I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better...,6/30/2010 16:52
432,432," Speaking of clothes, what do you think about shirts? Did you know that you can wear a necktie under the collar with a dress shirt? I do that for work",10/23/1980 8:47
432,432, I occasionally do that. The pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants to billy mays funeral. Disrespectful much?,6/26/1977 1:58
432,432," Haha that is either very disrespectful or very respectful LOL. I wish I lived in Hawaii though, you can wear an Aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie there",1/9/1990 5:45
432,997," That is probably because it is much warmer there. Nevertheless, I also wish that I could show up to work in a random t-shirt!",12/5/1994 23:49
432,432," Yep I agree with you! I think it's cool that the polo shirt was not invented by a polo player, but was actually invented by a tennis player, very interesting",11/19/1999 13:31
432,997," I wonder why it was called the polo shirt then, shouldn't it be called the 'tennis shirt'? Although that does sound quite weird",6/28/1998 9:53
432,997, Yes I think Polo sounds better haha. Also interesting that the man who invented that shirt was nicknamed the crocodile and that's why polo shirts have that crocodile logo on them,11/11/1999 7:31
432,997, Ah. China's cultural revolution gang revolved around layering as many shirts as humanly possible,8/2/2007 6:13
432,997, I wonder what that looked like! are you aware of the difference between a button up and a button down shirt?,8/23/1995 22:39
433,1579, DO you like poetry?,7/1/1984 12:01
433,433, I love it. Have you read the poem Chaos?,10/15/1985 14:44
433,1579," I have not, what is it about?",1/7/2003 6:57
433,433, It is a poem with 800 irregularly pronounced words and it has 274 lines,2/1/1996 3:22
433,1579, WOw that is awesome. Have you heard of that poem that is different when read normally and the backwards?,3/2/1983 10:04
433,433," I cannot say that I have, how different?",11/28/2016 7:29
433,1579, Normally read is depressive and backwards is inspiring ,6/28/1976 7:02
433,433, WOw cool. Do you know who CS LEwis and TOlkien are?,9/26/1993 15:45
433,1579, Yes they are both great authors from their time,4/14/1988 23:36
433,1579, Yes and they had you laugh you lose games over bad poetry,1/28/1975 4:17
434,1521, WOw that must have been hard for them to keep from laughing,2/9/1991 5:19
434,1521, True. Did you know art and poetry were olympic sports?,12/19/1988 3:01
434,1521," Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?",6/24/1987 1:56
434,434, I love dogs. They can learn up to 1000 words,10/31/2002 5:17
434,1521, Nice and they also understand pointing like elephants do too,4/18/2003 16:54
434,1521, Yes and they also are better at reasoning than the chimps,6/10/1989 13:28
434,1521," Nice, They also have 12 different blood types and have blood drives",3/6/1980 9:14
434,434, Nice. They drink with their underside of the tongue,6/17/2011 13:51
434,434, Wow neat. Google have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company,5/13/1988 2:48
434,434, SO cool. Nice chatting with you,10/11/2017 7:56
435,925, Same here,11/21/1999 15:08
435,925," Hi partner, what type of shoes do you like?",1/17/2006 7:25
435,435," I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years. ",4/26/2014 21:30
435,435, What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet?,10/13/2012 20:03
435,435, I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support. ,3/16/2003 10:33
435,925, I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting?,9/15/1987 22:31
435,435," I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can't afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes. ",9/28/2022 20:41
435,925," Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes?",2/15/1990 8:45
435,925," No, I don't think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place. ",11/18/1995 13:53
435,435," Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes?",7/14/1990 3:58
436,988," No, I didn't. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That's a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe. ",12/9/2002 10:24
436,988, Would you wear clothes made from animal skin?,5/7/1986 23:45
436,988," I wear leather shoes, and they are made of animal skin...so I guess the answer is yes. Would you?",8/12/1994 10:40
436,436," Yes, if it's made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it's a mind game with me.",3/2/2002 23:20
436,988, It seems people think it is acceptable to wear some clothes from certain types of animal skin but not others. It always reminds me of the movie 101 Dalmatians. Did you see that movie?,12/17/2010 7:32
436,436," I saw about 15 minutes, but I didn't get the understanding of the movie.",1/15/1988 9:55
436,988, I really liked the movie. The main point of the movie was that Cruella DeVille was trying to make a coat out of puppies. ,11/25/2019 9:26
436,988," Ok, I don't mind killing animals for food, but I dislike killing for clothes, when there are many other material used to make clothes.",4/16/1995 9:10
436,988, What is your favorite kind of fabric?,3/15/1989 0:28
436,436, Cotton is my favorite fabric. I think about 85% of our clothes are made from cotton.,4/20/1991 18:26
437,437," I like cotton a lot, too. I'm not a big polyester fan. I feel that the fabric feels fake. Also, it scares me that my clothes could be flammable. ",11/9/1987 11:51
437,472, You are right. I agree with you.,1/14/2015 14:10
437,472, Can you believe that there is a store in Alabama that only sells clothes found in unclaimed airport baggage? That's weird.,7/7/2018 20:53
437,437," Yes, that is weird, to sell clothes worn by don't know who or whom these clothes belongs to. ",7/11/1994 17:50
437,472," Exactly! You never know what happened in those clothes. That's what I always say about clothes at vintage stores, too. You don't know what happened in children's clothes...especially the pants. ",12/1/2015 1:02
437,472," These are all the questions I have for you, thanks",6/21/2015 13:51
437,437, Thank you. Nice talking with you! ,1/28/2014 0:28
437,472, Thanks,2/28/1993 7:35
437,472, hi,10/10/1981 2:28
437,472," Hi, how are you?  Are you a music fan?",10/31/2003 8:38
438,438, i am good...,11/13/2017 19:01
438,546, Me too.  Do you ever listen to things on LP?  ,2/10/2004 16:02
438,546, Yes...... when i was in clg,5/26/1975 10:04
438,438," I still have one at home and some of my grandfathers old records, but for most of my music I ve moved in to the 20th Centruy and gone with CDs and mostly MP3.",3/6/1970 4:33
438,438, thats amazing...... ,5/13/1995 22:29
438,438, Do you have a favorite album?,6/9/2005 2:22
438,546," castle of glass, my favorite ",6/30/1998 6:01
438,438," Im a big fan of Dream Theater's recent work The Astonishing.  It doesnt quite hold up to NWA's work or Dark side of the moon in terms of popularity, but I like it.",4/18/1986 12:40
438,546, thats great..... i listen to their songs abut to be quiet frank i dont know them as you do........,12/26/1979 8:38
438,546," They are a little more obscure, kind of like Ricky Gervais, who was actually a pop singer in the 80's.  I had no clue about that.",8/28/1995 12:05
439,184, best music was from the 80's.... all kinds...... wish we were born then.,12/6/2016 1:58
439,439," Very true, a study from 2012 even proves music has become more similar in terms of musical construction since the 60's.",7/24/1986 14:16
439,184, thats good news....... but nothing to beat a classic,8/22/1985 4:56
439,439, Like We are the Champions being voted the catchiest pop song ever.  I cant think of a person who hasnt heard that one.,3/31/2012 6:06
439,184, Queen i a legend like he used to mention...... lots of his songs are my energy boosters,4/26/2002 8:51
439,439," Freddie is probably one of the most iconic singers of all time.  All of their music is just fantastic.  The new stuff, even the k-pop band  Moranbong Band, which is top in Korea doesnt hold a candle to what was done in the 80-90's",2/11/1981 18:14
439,439," absolutely....... songs  like another one bites the dust, Crazy little thing called love, i want to break free, we will rock you and of course bohemian rhapsody .... legendry",10/16/1984 18:37
439,439, I find it hard to believe Linkin Parks hybrid theory is the best selling album of the 21st century.,4/15/1981 0:16
439,439," its really good , paper cut, with you,  runaway...... good songs",8/15/1972 6:17
439,439," I like their music.  I think it is really neat that NWA Straight outta compton was the first album to ever go platinum, and that is with out airplay or a major tour to support it.",11/8/2002 8:18
440,440, I agree...... they are good.,11/9/1990 2:42
440,440," Well, I must get going.  It has been nice chatting with you today.",7/9/1982 2:04
440,544, same here.....,6/17/2019 22:06
440,544," hello, do you use netflix?",3/18/1981 11:57
440,440," Hello, yes I do! Sometimes I use the hour long fireplace video at home. Do you like Netflix too?",5/9/2004 13:40
440,544," I love netflix, so many shows and movies in there. Do you remember blockbuster?",4/8/2003 2:38
440,440, I do! I wonder if Netflix and Blockbuster ever could have done a partnership or something like that.,11/5/2011 16:20
440,544, Well Blockbuster had the chance to buy it and passed on it. bad decision,8/21/1998 7:37
440,544," Definitely a terrible decision, now Netflix has all these great selections. Last I checked they have almost 150 movies with perfect ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.",5/5/1985 22:48
440,544," Yesh for sure, and they offerd it to blockbuster for only $50 million",12/18/1998 18:24
441,441," That would have been a steal for sure. I wonder how much Netflix pays their taggers, who have to watch and label the content.",10/24/1998 8:33
441,1300, Hmm good question. Do you know how netflix came about?,10/14/1999 16:05
441,441," I believe they started off with DVD sales and rentals, and eventually transitioned into streaming media. I wonder how they improve technology from here.",10/29/2000 23:18
441,441, Yeah and then the owner of netflix was fine $40 for a late fee and got sick of it,1/16/2008 14:56
441,441, It's interesting how people get inspiration for things. IMDb is actually older than the first web browsers on the internet.,5/30/2010 3:52
441,441, That is truly very cool. Did you know netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america?,6/18/1993 15:45
441,1300, I never knew that! I wonder if it's similar for other TV/movie platforms. Are you interested in cinematography in general?,8/29/1978 10:38
441,1300, Yeah I am. Do you know who pioneered the wide-angle cameras?,9/17/1996 9:04
441,441," I am not sure actually, I know Nicolas Rehn was a pioneer in high-contrast cinematography to see what's happening on screen.",7/3/1975 10:30
441,1300, The guy who pioneered it was the chinese-american James WOng,5/31/2018 6:48
442,767," Ahh ok, it certainly must have been a significant achievement. Are you interested in film ratings? I use review sites a lot.",9/21/2012 10:30
442,767, Yes I like to refer to IMDb. How about you?,8/21/2000 21:10
442,442," I do too, although sometimes they can be inaccurate. Shawshank redemption wasn't very commercially successful yet it's one of their highest rated films ever.",10/27/1983 12:28
442,767," Yeah, you never know , right? Nice chatting with you.",1/5/2018 0:43
442,442, hey there what do you think of planet earth?,2/26/2000 6:15
442,767, It's a nice place. I've lived there my whole life. I'm pretty attached. What about you?,2/11/1972 17:48
442,442," haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though",2/19/2002 4:51
442,442, Only 20% more to go! We are a destructive species. Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time.,5/28/2005 20:04
442,767," thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time",6/5/2022 1:26
442,442, The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation. ,10/31/1971 4:57
443,636," that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint?",4/16/2012 3:14
443,636," Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic.",5/1/1999 11:57
443,443," ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100",10/19/1999 7:42
443,636, We'll get our helium from fusion reactors. Every kid can have party balloons.,12/17/2018 19:52
443,636," haha well I hope so. It's pretty silly there is an ambassador to extraterrestrials at the UN, I want his job",1/26/2018 9:20
443,636, I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.,1/2/1985 17:23
443,443," haha ya, lots of waiting and doing nothihng, have you ever ridden a horse",12/12/2014 2:08
443,443," Nope, never ridden a horse. Haven't eaten one either.",12/15/1980 22:40
443,636," haha nope I have ridden one, I guess they evolved over like 50 million years",6/20/2021 17:01
443,636, They went from multi-toed to single-toed. I guess they were more useful to humans that way.,4/5/2000 2:34
444,1242," ya I think so, they became really widespread about 3000BC, so kind of a long time",11/25/1996 18:50
444,1242, Interspecies utility is interesting. Dalmatians are associated with firefighting because they would calm  the horses.,4/15/1979 6:46
444,1242, that's nice of them. did you knw clint eastwood was allergic to horses?,6/5/2006 13:55
444,444," Yeah, he acquired an allergy later in life. Very odd.",11/20/1975 11:22
444,1242, would you ride a horse to school?,3/11/2004 14:30
444,1242, Earth is amazing don't you think? So much history in its 4.5 billion years of creation.,7/21/1999 23:27
444,444," I think it is amazing! Not only the composition and history of earth, but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system.",8/17/1974 21:58
444,444," I agree, so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth's history.",6/11/1998 4:16
444,444, What do you mean?,12/9/2000 13:26
444,1242," I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period,",12/18/1977 21:04
445,1075," Oh wow! That is really neat, time really does fly! I really appreciate these tech billionaire's efforts into space exploration, like Elon Musk and his bold initiative to start colonization in Mars.",6/30/2020 14:00
445,445, I heard he wants to build a supersonic vertical take off jet.,7/9/2015 19:46
445,1075," Whatever that is, it just sounds super cool! I wonder how he finds time the to do all these things, he's the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, chairman of SolarCity. It makes me seem very unproductive",3/18/2012 10:48
445,1075," I know it seems like he wouldnt have much time, he is also an actor and producer, seems like he has more than 24 hours in his day.",11/8/1992 14:39
445,445," He is an actor and producer? I didn't know that, do you know which movies/TV shows he is involved with?",12/4/2022 7:50
445,1075, He's in a production called Thank you for smoking; I haven't seen it either though.,2/12/2007 22:12
445,1075," That seems a little ironic for his recent ordeal with smoking marijuana during an interview with the host and was fined, I think. His wife or ex-wife also appeared in Christopher Nolan's film, Inception.",2/4/1977 17:14
445,1075, Thats Elon Musk's wife? I didnt know that!  she is a good actress.,2/19/2006 2:25
445,445," I'm not sure which character she played, but according to the article, she appeared in it. I wonder if that movie inspired him to create any of his companies.",5/22/1985 21:08
445,1075," Could be, so anyway, do you like horses?",8/12/1993 17:05
446,1079," Yes, but I would never ride a horse to school like what two high school students did on the no vehicles to school day, very creative though",2/13/2020 20:42
446,446," I agree, really creative for sure, I bet they got in a lot of trouble too.",6/28/2012 10:37
446,446," Yes, they were suspended, which seems a little harsh to me.",5/11/2010 14:38
446,1079, It does seem harsh but then again the horses could lose control and create a lof of chaos.,2/9/1995 0:11
446,446," Yes, especially if they had brought Icelandic horses, which have a fifth speed, called the tolt, which is a speedwalking unit for a horse",10/25/1990 12:10
446,446, Can you imagine all the chaos? Another cool fact is that Clint Easthood is allergic to horses.,9/8/2006 1:10
446,446," Hi, how are you? Do like horses?",11/7/1987 21:25
446,446," Hey there I love horses. Even though I'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think",11/11/1993 16:39
446,1079," You're allergic? Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I've never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals.",8/26/1973 0:12
446,446," I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason",2/29/2004 10:22
447,1184," I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there?",1/21/2002 6:14
447,1184," yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol",4/24/1993 18:54
447,1184," I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended?",8/4/1993 8:24
447,1184, I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses,12/31/2001 7:26
447,1184, I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something.,8/12/1984 22:51
447,447, Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha,3/8/2007 19:21
447,1184," That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology. You?",3/30/1991 17:39
447,447, Yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious. I think he has a dog but it's not a Dalmatian though haha. His wife also appeared in the movie Inception by the way,5/26/2016 11:13
447,1184, I thought he got divorced? Is he still married? She must be pretty.,10/30/1975 22:32
447,447," I think he is still married. I'm not sure what she looks like though, did you ever watch the movie thank you for smoking by the way?",3/6/1983 20:24
448,448," Yes, I did. A long time ago. An interesting film. I like Aaron whatshisname. ",12/27/1981 14:29
448,448," Yes I did like that movie, Elon Musk apparently produced it and I forgot that he acted in it too",6/29/2006 1:08
448,726," I'll have to check for that. He is a talented, intelligent guy. ",9/22/2013 1:51
448,448," Yep absolutely. I love that he wants to create a vertical take-off jet, that also is electric, I think that would be cool I would love to have that haha",8/20/1977 22:40
448,448," His ideas are astronomical. Anyway, great chat! Have a good night! Go watch Thanks for Smoking again.",10/12/1997 19:15
448,448," Yes I'm going to check it out very soon, I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for Elon Musk haha. also I'll keep my eyes peeled for his rocket that will colonize Mars haha",1/22/2016 22:19
448,448," Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!",8/26/2020 14:12
448,448," sounds good, I'll be waiting for Spacex!",3/16/1976 14:42
448,448," Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet",4/16/2022 18:09
448,726, I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.,10/4/2019 5:44
449,1245," I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now",10/1/1987 13:56
449,1245, That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice.,10/10/1989 18:41
449,1245, Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon.,12/8/2014 12:11
449,449, Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements.,10/27/1971 1:59
449,449," I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history",1/16/1993 22:36
449,449, I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun?,11/1/2009 10:38
449,1245," Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.",9/10/2020 22:23
449,449," I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.  He's already planning a colony on Mars.",4/10/1985 18:34
449,449," Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know",9/15/1981 13:57
449,449, I didn't know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well.,3/7/1972 16:19
450,482," Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception",12/8/1984 10:24
450,482, Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it's part of Tesla.,4/15/1982 17:15
450,450," He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers.",8/12/1986 11:09
450,450," That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn't.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space.",4/4/1981 3:22
450,450," That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful.",7/28/2007 23:21
450,482, If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.,9/7/1993 11:49
450,482," Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth",9/3/1989 2:06
450,482, He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It's a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it's a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.,6/9/2006 14:43
450,450," Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger, one day he will be remembered as Galileo and other historic figures.",5/2/1977 19:52
450,450, Have you ever seen the movie Snowden,10/15/1988 4:47
451,451," Not yet. I know that's about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right? ",6/10/2007 21:13
451,1598, Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government's plans to destroy them. ,4/24/2007 17:19
451,1598," That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land.",10/10/1992 2:19
451,451," That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol",1/24/2008 21:23
451,451, Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny.,11/22/2005 19:12
451,451," Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions",1/18/1994 15:02
451,451, Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined.,11/10/2004 11:51
451,451, That's deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House. ,7/14/2017 7:07
451,451," Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner.",11/21/2002 22:02
451,1598, Sounds like another administration i can think of. ,3/30/1984 14:40
452,452," Einstein was very involved in American politics. To this day, his estate earns $18 million annually.",11/28/2013 19:40
452,610, He was born in Germany right?,3/21/2011 21:41
452,452," Yes, but he was very worldly. He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $1 for his autograph. All of that collected money was donated to charities.",10/21/1988 8:57
452,452, Well that doesn't sound too bad. This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and placed it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939.,4/1/1997 10:51
452,610, 6939. I wonder why so far into the future. He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future.,5/15/2014 16:34
452,452," Maybe, thats too far in the future for me. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833. ",5/28/2009 13:28
452,452, Just a little too far ha-ha. And natural philosophy was a precursor of natural science.,10/25/1975 2:17
452,452, They say that Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.,6/20/2003 7:11
452,610, Einstein would have been in all his glory if he had the chance. And it would have been well deserved since he wrote to Roosevelt about uranium being turned into bombs.,5/16/2002 5:16
452,610, Yeah he did a lot more than what he's best known for  mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2,3/8/1988 19:52
453,5," Eureka! He sure did. But anyway, I enjoyed our chat! It was very informative. I hope you have a great evening.",5/15/1989 4:20
453,5, you too!,7/10/2002 18:39
453,5, Take care!,7/25/1977 21:50
453,453," Are you a science fan? did you know that the estate of Einstein earns more that 18,000,000 a year? Pretty amazing inventor!",6/29/2004 10:00
453,453, I do love science. There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry. ,9/21/2021 13:15
453,453, Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2?,11/1/1998 21:27
453,5, I did know that. I find it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago. We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb,8/4/1970 18:36
453,453, It seems ironic that scientist put men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon.,1/1/1993 17:09
453,453, I think astronauts need a different temperment than someone who works in a lab or engineering. There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists. ,1/6/2020 6:59
453,453, So true. The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization. . .How much it changed the world!,2/27/1998 12:53
454,454, It really has! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable. I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they did it.,7/21/2019 1:45
454,454, I am sure they had no idea! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell.  Had this thought that curiosity shoud drive invention,11/12/2022 7:53
454,454, I think curiousity is a great thing. The internet sure has helped with that. Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble accessing. ,1/16/2001 8:06
454,454, So often only governments and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need. It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled The usefulness of Useless Knowledge.,8/23/2003 4:17
454,454, If only that money was put to better use.,12/29/1995 18:43
454,1090," It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio! ",11/11/1981 8:48
454,454, I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to. ,10/27/2007 16:59
454,454, I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution. I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal.,1/30/2017 22:40
454,454, The problems lie in the facts that it is doing nothing but driving us deeper into debt as federal funding goes to these pointless projects that are driven in the name of research for research's sake and has no practical value. ,3/28/1981 5:15
454,1090," That is so true now. In the days of the 30s, 40s, and fifties, the inventions such as dishwashers, air conditioners, and fax machines would drive the economy up.",3/29/2000 10:33
455,1246, I think if we were to address the cost of inflation and the realities of what our government has done to the economy vs what other countries are doing we would be in a better place as a nation in america. ,1/4/2017 17:47
455,1246," I don't think that we would have the luxuries in our homes and lives that we have now without scientist. as a sidenote, did you know that Einstein answered his own mail? ",12/29/2016 16:16
455,455, I could see that. He seemed like a very down to earth man for how brilliant he was. ,3/10/2006 20:03
455,455, That he could do that and earn the Nobel Prize for Physics shows that he was somewhat down to earth.,10/23/1982 22:56
455,1246, He was a brilliant and kind man who impacted the science community in so many ways. ,2/23/1995 19:30
455,1246," Hello, do you follow the government?",8/13/2003 23:22
455,1246," A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada. ",10/27/2019 6:20
455,1246," Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy.",2/23/1990 23:48
455,1246," They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don't think anyone would want those areas. ",11/4/2015 21:34
455,455, Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks?,1/5/1991 6:46
456,456," No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.  ",10/20/1990 15:49
456,456, True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. ,8/6/2010 16:52
456,456," Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police. ",3/9/2002 22:03
456,456, Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. ,1/19/2002 11:11
456,456, Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so. ,8/19/1972 0:24
456,456, I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein?,6/18/1972 7:29
456,1859, I know he was a scientist. Is he German ?,1/31/1997 9:14
456,1859," Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel. ",3/31/1985 4:22
456,456, Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face. ,6/29/2006 7:34
456,1859, Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP.,1/9/1998 19:33
457,351," So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.  ",1/13/1984 19:50
457,351, He was a good man and very smart. That's cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph?,1/3/1999 9:58
457,457," That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ?",12/16/1971 22:04
457,351, Not really sure lol. Seems a little bizarre. It was good chatting with you!,7/2/1984 6:33
457,457," Good, but there are other interesting scientists to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist. ",4/27/2003 17:04
457,351, That's good. Take care!,7/6/2013 21:09
457,351, How do you think our government is doing?,9/1/2003 18:34
457,351," Hi, I think they are doing pretty good right now. What do you think?",6/7/1985 3:31
457,457," I think so too, lots of drama with it, but as long as they are doing their job I am fine with it",3/23/1982 9:41
457,457, For sure. I saw Wikileaks once published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks.,1/29/1985 15:34
458,458," that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government",6/13/1977 16:08
458,458, That's a lot of Nevada they own. I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there.,2/26/2004 2:27
458,458," I am sure there has to be. It is all desert, but I am sure they are doing some crazy things there",4/17/2021 18:48
458,425," I bet they are. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. ",8/24/2006 6:36
458,425," Wow, that is something! I wish we did that but I think we donate billions already to other countries with aid. ",5/9/2005 6:31
458,425, Yes we do donate a lot. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice,4/3/1999 22:40
458,458," that is awesome! not once, but twice! Someone had to have gotten fired over it lol",9/29/2005 3:45
458,425, I agree. Do you know much about Einstein?,4/10/2010 8:44
458,458, I know he was some super smart guy and scientist. I think his estate gets a ton of money still,2/11/2018 13:41
458,425," He was very smart. Looks like his estate gets $18,000,000 annually. ",8/26/2015 13:55
459,1807," wow that is a ton of money, literally! I wonder what for. I am sure he has a ton of patents",7/7/2004 3:19
459,459, I bet. Einstein was a member of the NAACP.,5/23/2016 13:59
459,1807," that is awesome, he didn't discriminate. He lived during those times. I think he was asked to be the president of Israel also once",10/8/2018 23:25
459,459, That's pretty cool. Did you know he charged $1 for his autograph?,3/28/2021 12:14
459,459, that is awesome! I hope he donated the money to charity or something. It was nice chatting with you!,7/24/1988 8:32
459,459, It was good chatting with you too. Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist as well?,7/21/2000 3:58
459,459, wow that is pretty crazy stuff! What a smart dude! Enjoy your day!,3/6/1970 13:16
459,1807, Hi there! Do you think voting is important?,8/15/1971 0:26
459,459," No today i don't, sorry i think it's all rigged.What about you? ",2/18/2014 4:54
459,459," Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote.",9/5/2019 21:16
460,460, Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space? ,12/1/1977 21:11
460,460, Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions.,10/5/1980 5:17
460,557, Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel. ,9/5/1996 17:19
460,460," I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst.",11/19/1975 14:55
460,557," Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote",10/1/2014 1:59
460,460, That's sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years.,5/22/1989 7:45
460,460, Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won.,1/5/2012 4:05
460,460, Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn't make me have faith in the system either!,2/21/1982 21:18
460,557, It' supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not. ,6/21/2022 14:03
460,557, Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections?,12/8/2005 17:48
461,461, I'm on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn't.,1/27/1988 7:43
461,1659," Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.",12/13/1973 7:10
461,461, Right i'm with you. Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?,2/4/1970 6:48
461,1659," Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was!",7/6/1990 9:01
461,1659, I know and then all of a sudden right! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away. I wonder how? ,6/13/2009 15:02
461,1659," Yeah, I'm not sure. And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner. Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons, and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets.",4/29/1996 15:11
461,461, Wow! Hey there a five planets in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye.,9/15/1983 21:24
461,461," Cool, I want to go out right now and see how many I can spot. Have a good night!",4/28/2003 22:43
461,1659, Planets are pretty crazy if  you think about it,3/14/1984 5:39
461,461," Yes, they are. I am crazy enough to appreciate them though. What interesting facts about planets do you know?",8/13/1972 4:14
462,1," Jupiter's moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun, do you know any?",4/10/1988 20:48
462,462," I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis, and others spin on their SIDE. crazy, huh?",12/11/2015 5:51
462,1," wow, very crazy, what would earth be like spinning on its side lol. I heard Uranus rolls around the sun",1/5/1976 3:49
462,1," URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name.",1/1/1976 19:10
462,1," Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing",11/24/1987 21:04
462,462, that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away.,3/30/1997 19:38
462,462," right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right?",9/4/1987 15:56
462,1, It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing.,4/5/1997 13:07
462,1," Right, that could be his next venture. You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime?",5/30/2004 15:53
462,1," Yes, we will, but how long can they be there? and what can they do that a probe cant? ",4/22/2015 0:17
463,737," That is a valid point, I am glad someone is spending money on it. Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol?",6/30/2008 10:00
463,463," Um, i dont know about the Space Force. Maybe? THe govt has 22 trillion in debt. it is not a popular idea at the moment. ",4/29/2014 3:55
463,737," I think our elected president will push it like the wall, are you a fan of him?",9/28/2015 12:56
463,463, I am not really a trump fan. the wall is going to be in the next budget. about 8 billion. i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting.,6/2/1972 20:43
463,463," I think so too, I wonder who he will run against. I think if he wins it will show it was rigged again, but that is my opinion",9/29/1989 9:35
463,463, The democratic field is a jumble now. it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent.,6/3/2019 12:31
463,463," I agree, there seems like there is already 20 running and I have only heard of like 4 of them. I need to research more. It was so nice chatting with you!",6/7/2000 18:56
463,463, It has been great! Im glad that the system is up again! Have a good evening!,3/14/2011 19:50
463,463," I am too, I hope it lasts! Have a good evening also!",2/2/2003 17:53
463,463," hi, did you vote in the last election?",12/9/2002 10:56
464,464," Hi, how are you? Which election? 2018?",4/12/2008 5:33
464,1683, The 2016 one?,7/7/2002 2:31
464,464," Yes, I did vote. Did you vote?",9/24/1970 7:05
464,1683, Yes of course. Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter?,6/15/2014 14:04
464,464, I guess the gov't needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn't exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years,3/15/1976 15:48
464,464," I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally",2/13/1987 6:28
464,1683, They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the none of these candidates voting option for presidential elections,1/4/1984 17:59
464,1683, I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space?,7/20/1997 13:12
464,464, I figure they have the right. I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote.,7/26/1990 8:42
464,1683, Maybe all of them I hope. even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918,11/27/1987 8:03
465,479," Maybe you needed to own land, or have a title or something. I wonder if the same rules applied to women.",5/19/1997 13:47
465,465," I am not sure, but glad we all get to vote now. Did you know in atlanta 34% of the black male population cannot vote?",2/5/1986 4:38
465,479," That sounds like the South. I wonder what would happen if a basketball player ran for president.Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time.",11/11/1983 9:55
465,465, That is an interesting one. In ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery,4/27/1978 9:06
465,479, I guess they didn't want rich people to have power. Randomness changes things up.,6/30/1986 6:36
465,479," I guess, but it seems it worked well for them. Do you know much about the planet?",1/26/2020 11:23
465,479," The one that I'm on right now? Sure, I know a few things. ",11/28/1979 9:53
465,465, Well all of them I guess Like that planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mpg on 2000 fahrenehit weather,6/12/1987 1:16
465,465," I think you'd better bring an umbrella. Anyhoo, thanks for the chat!",10/23/1984 8:22
465,465," same here, have a good one",6/22/2010 17:16
466,466, What did you think of the article about the shootings in Parkland,3/23/2004 4:30
466,466, I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas,6/11/2016 14:38
466,1080, I thought it was sad too. It's a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It's not even safe to go to school anymore,9/5/1997 13:30
466,466, I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians,12/17/1981 11:18
466,466, There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn't have to worry about what's going to happen to their children when they send them to school.,7/14/2020 10:43
466,1080, I guess it's important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line,8/9/1998 8:48
466,466," Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don't care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end.",10/16/1971 7:29
466,466," Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy",10/10/2004 22:00
466,466, Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn't be in office if the elections was done by lottery.,6/17/2015 9:00
466,1080," No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape",6/25/2019 7:13
467,1998," You're probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn't count so they don't bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected",12/7/2000 15:38
467,1998, I think Nevada has it right with the option none of the candidates as a voting option,3/28/2015 7:39
467,1998, I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don't think are good enough to be in office,4/25/2007 15:55
467,467," People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst",7/11/2005 12:27
467,467, They really do. I wonder why they wanted to name it after him. I also wonder why all men couldn't vote until 1918,9/29/1997 13:10
467,1998," I don't know, I also don't know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India",9/6/2017 14:23
467,467, I don't know why there are polling booths like that either. It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space,2/5/1981 20:29
467,1998, That's nuts. Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun,2/26/2010 21:10
467,467, It is. I find it strange how venus doesn't have seasons,12/29/1998 0:02
467,467," Yea, Uranus is strange too since it rotates sideways",5/30/1993 3:37
468,468, Exactly. That is very strange. Just like the planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways,8/23/1974 9:41
468,468," Shards of glass and 2000 degree weather, sounds fun",9/5/2001 8:38
468,1733," Hi, how are you?",12/15/1971 7:38
468,468, I'm great! How are you?,2/21/2001 14:39
468,468," Well, thanks! How is your smelling ability",4/14/2021 4:40
468,1733," It's pretty good, on par will most. I still can synthesize my own vitamin C.",9/10/2006 8:04
468,1733, How is your hearing?,3/30/2021 20:53
468,468," Hearing is pretty good. Like most humans, I have excellent distant running abilities. Well, maybe I used to.",8/7/1993 5:23
468,1733, There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird...,5/11/2019 4:08
468,1733," I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound.",8/27/1976 8:38
469,469, Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs,9/28/1983 8:52
469,469," I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself.",1/28/1997 16:25
469,469, Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious...,8/16/2008 12:17
469,1584," That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that. ",9/12/1983 5:00
469,1584," No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat...",6/26/1999 17:06
469,469, Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord.,2/9/1984 3:17
469,1584, Yeah! They would do some damage... I wonder how they would consume water?,8/5/2005 2:28
469,1584, I don't know whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish. ,4/26/2003 18:28
469,1584, That would make the difference. I kknow they do not have necks...,7/13/1976 16:26
469,1584, The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. But it's not immortal!,10/1/1987 7:47
470,470," Is there anything that is immortal, besides Hulk Hogan?",2/6/2009 8:13
470,475, There is a breed of jellyfish that's immortal. Probably goes by the nickname Hulk Hogan.,4/30/1982 6:15
470,470, HA! Nice chatting with you!,4/18/1980 19:42
470,470, It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it?,7/22/2000 7:49
470,470," I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago.",8/22/2014 16:12
470,470," Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time.",12/20/2001 6:33
470,475," I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from.",10/8/1970 18:46
470,470, That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'?,9/5/1976 6:31
470,475," It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many.",5/8/2019 4:31
470,475," Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels.",9/5/1995 23:17
471,471," I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific.",3/27/2010 7:43
471,471, I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before.,7/3/1989 2:19
471,471," The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city.",8/31/1984 20:12
471,1619, Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love.,12/13/1997 4:47
471,1619," I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us.",8/24/1987 11:18
471,471," True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.",11/18/1993 10:24
471,471," It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.",6/17/1993 3:33
471,471," Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I'm referring to based on shared experience.",12/27/1990 16:37
471,1619," Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can't imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat.",10/7/1999 1:41
471,471, That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I'm always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot.,2/23/1988 0:04
472,472," I wonder what they'd make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking.",3/23/2003 10:38
472,472," They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone's home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don't mix odors. ",11/24/1985 4:06
472,472," Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish?",10/29/1980 14:58
472,472, I heard that but wonder how they determined it?,10/23/2022 5:32
472,1847," Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck",4/1/1985 13:44
472,472, Yes. Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it's immortal.,1/20/1975 10:01
472,472," Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA, I thought the US was against censorship",3/8/1995 1:34
472,1847, I did too. What was the subject matter and when did it happen?,6/19/1973 3:41
472,472," I have no idea, I'd guess the thirties or fifties.  Some kinds of novels with problematic themes",1/11/2022 14:25
472,472, Probably of a sexual nature. Many people seem to think that leads to corruption.,6/25/1989 3:27
473,473," Well, it was good speaking to you.",1/3/1996 12:49
473,473, Hello! Do you like to read?,12/2/2020 18:13
473,473," Hi, yes I like to read both Fiction and not fiction, what about you?",9/13/1975 22:32
473,1176, I'm into non-fiction more than anything. I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then.,8/16/1989 7:28
473,473," Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books",8/13/1983 21:34
473,1176, That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day!,10/28/2011 13:09
473,1176, That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!!,12/4/1970 11:31
473,473, That is so crazy! I didn't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been!,11/7/1983 16:07
473,1176," Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature",8/16/1984 13:22
473,473," Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago?",7/13/2000 18:00
474,474, LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel,2/13/2003 14:01
474,215, I'm sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn't in that since he won a nobel prize in literature.,8/22/2015 4:18
474,474, Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize!,1/30/2005 14:01
474,215, You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us?,12/10/1988 9:59
474,215," Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib",12/9/1978 4:33
474,474," That is crazy that we can! I wish we could regrow hair lol, and vitamin C but we can't, but everything else can!",5/20/2014 13:24
474,215," That would be awesome! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months, there must be something to regrow hair, we just have to discover it!",9/11/1975 18:56
474,215, I agree! We need to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is!,5/3/2020 1:29
474,215," That is amazing! and about sea creatures, did you know only the seahorse has a neck?",10/27/2011 1:50
474,474," That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there, but very cool! Fish are just crazy!",3/8/2020 8:32
475,1711, Did you know that there is a difference how fresh water and salt water fishes drink water?,7/24/2009 9:04
475,475, Isn't it something with osmosis? I'm going to look more into that. Have a great day!,10/31/2003 13:27
475,475, How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have?,9/19/1970 22:29
475,1711," Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor.",11/24/2022 5:49
475,475," Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of.",2/13/1970 19:10
475,1711," Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia.",2/19/1998 16:25
475,475," True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances.",2/8/1996 9:19
475,475," True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. ",9/11/2008 8:43
475,1711," McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.",9/9/1977 4:10
475,1711," Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.",6/19/2022 21:42
476,476," I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language.",5/19/2020 5:31
476,476," Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as human.",9/18/1978 9:07
476,1634," True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor.",11/17/1972 3:32
476,476," True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago",2/11/2007 3:52
476,476," Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human.

476,1634, I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history?,8/28/1997 16:01
476,1634," Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language",4/30/1993 21:43
476,1634," Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn't?",12/11/1997 14:52

477,1218, What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs?,12/25/1979 6:54

477,477, Fish are pretty amazing.      There was a koi fish named hanako that lived for 226 years    Thanks for the chat!,3/21/1996 2:13
477,477, Do you like fish?,1/26/2015 8:35
477,477," Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths.",12/4/1971 1:02
477,1218," I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before?",5/23/1973 21:28
477,1218," Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong. ",3/1/1981 2:09
477,477," I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator",3/25/1990 8:21
477,1218," Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish.",3/7/1971 12:43
478,30, The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck,4/18/2021 23:21
478,30," Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out.

478,478," Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months.",10/22/1988 7:57
478,30," Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom",4/8/2015 0:33
478,30," Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can.",7/2/1973 6:53
478,478," I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science, ",3/18/1971 18:53
478,30," Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That's really funny. ",9/7/2008 3:12
478,478," I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest",11/23/2014 10:21
478,478," Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don't know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting.",12/21/2017 20:24
479,479," It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?",11/28/1992 10:23
479,948," Yes, he was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize, ironically though, it was in literature and not peace.",7/30/1995 13:16
479,479, I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works,3/20/2006 21:16
479,948," Yeah, he sounds like an interesting guy. It's kind of curious though, because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature. How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then? That one had a lot of kissing on the lips.",11/2/1989 12:36
479,948," Yeah one that ended with two deaths and poison, hope you have  a nice night. ",12/8/2017 15:14
479,948," Hi there,, do you have a favorite instrument?",1/3/1999 10:33
479,948," Hi there, I do I love the guitar and the piano. How about you?",6/26/1997 8:00
479,948, Yes I love the piano too. Once the BBC played music as they felt they did not have important news,1/11/1991 0:53
479,479, Wow that is impressive. Freddie Mercury and McCarthy also played piano too,3/29/1974 22:57
479,479," Yeah and they played the same piano once, freedie for bohemian rhapsody and mccarthy for hey jude",12/5/2006 20:44
480,715, Nice that is pretty cool. Have you heard of circus galop?,7/6/1985 19:27
480,480, Yeah that is the stress testing song for pianos that humans cannot play,10/26/1998 6:29
480,480, There is a piano that sits on top of the highest mountain in the UK,10/2/1999 23:13
480,715, Oh that must be the one that the climbers found when they were hiking up there,5/1/1996 19:54
480,715," Yes that is the one. Do you ever shop online, like on Amazon?",12/28/2000 18:14
480,715, I do actually. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain?,8/24/2002 13:39
480,480," Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years. AMazon owns IMDB, pretty cool",1/2/2019 17:30
480,715, They are everywhere now. And they have a deal with US Postal Service to deliver on Sundays,5/14/2009 10:01
480,480, That is so convenient. And their workers seem to be really busy all day long ,5/26/1973 6:25
480,715," Yes they can walk anywhere between 7-15 miles, that is a lot of steps",11/24/2017 7:27
481,481, That sure is. Have you ever bought from AmazonBasics?,10/23/2003 23:15
481,1344," I have, I know they are supposed to be on the lower end but I find their stuff to be pretty good too",11/29/2001 17:59
481,1344," I agree, it is pretty good. The first guy to buy on amazon got a building named after him",8/11/1991 16:20
481,481, Yes and all he had to do was spend less than $30. What a contribution,2/18/1989 17:59
481,481, Yeah pretty awesome for him. Do you like animals?,11/7/1981 1:22
481,1344," I do, my favorite are dogs but I also like others like cats, snakes, elephants and such",12/12/1987 2:23
481,481," Hello Friend, do you like baseball?",11/7/2013 10:21
481,1344," Yea, I'm a hugh Yankees fan, I never knew a 17 year old female pitcher once struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig then got banned, sounds like they signed her",4/2/1974 12:58
481,1344," Yes, did you know that baseball managers were uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?",8/9/2010 11:41
481,1344, I didn't know that was the reason why managers wore uniforms but I've heard of mangers playing in the game on rare occasions ,3/9/2017 8:00
482,482," Yes, did you also know that a man found $3 Million worth of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfather's attic hidden there since the 1940s?",2/23/1994 4:52
482,482," No that's crazy, I wonder if they had cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs",12/17/2017 15:13
482,482, That could be.  Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,3/6/1988 8:31
482,482," No, that's an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out?",2/8/1971 8:25
482,482," That's cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history?",2/15/1998 6:34
482,390," No but I'm not surprised, it had been 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series",4/9/1994 15:40
482,390," Yes, and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series, and didn't win again until 2016.",12/24/1971 20:14
482,482," I never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans, I wonder why they were called that",5/23/2013 14:20
482,482," Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball, both having been founded the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn.",9/12/1992 1:40
482,390," Interesting, I never knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand, I wonder if those features gave them an advantage",12/26/2021 6:18
483,1399," I'm not sure but in 1945, the Chicago Cubs baseball team was cursed when the stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in a World Series stadium with his smelly pet goat.  The cubs did not play in a World Series again until 2016.",3/15/2018 6:09
483,483," Lol, spooky. Did you know that the Dodgers lost the most world series than any other team?",3/18/2010 0:19
483,1399," Yes, did you know that as of 2018 the World Series has been contested 114 times?",10/17/2001 2:23
483,1399, Yes and the AL has the edge with 66 victories compared to the NL's 48,1/12/2021 7:22
483,1399, Fascinating.  Did you know that in the 1992 World Series that the US Marine Corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down?,10/14/1993 22:59
483,1399," Lol no, maybe the US marines were trying to get into the Toronto Blue Jays head",11/14/1982 12:22
483,483, That could be. Nice chatting and have a good night.,8/16/2021 6:19
483,483," Hi, do you like baseball/",10/29/2005 7:24
483,1399, Hai. How are you?,3/13/1980 6:51
483,483, Did you know why baseball managers do wear their uniforms during a game?,1/24/2011 7:38
484,484, Yes... same dress code to baseball managers,12/21/1984 23:31
484,1060," Yeah, if there is a need they will have to play, I  have never seen that happen!",9/21/1995 11:44
484,484, oh...why are you saw that happen,1/2/2016 18:23
484,1060, I did play kickball when i was a child did you play as well?,12/7/2007 22:36
484,484, oh really nice.. I am play football...,2/3/1995 16:23
484,484," Intersting. In canada kickball is called, soccer baseball, I think it makes sense!",4/27/1980 6:52
484,1060, yes.. I think sports are giving knowledge.,7/3/1992 17:34
484,484, Did you know baseball is really popular in japan?,6/22/2022 15:21
484,484, yes.. I know.. But i don't know about baseball. Are you explain about baseball.,5/7/1999 17:19
484,484," Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field.",10/20/1986 11:13
485,485, oh...very nice explanation. ,2/16/2005 23:39
485,1672," Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run",8/16/2013 1:49
485,1672, wow...very interesting game. I will try to play baseball.,12/31/1982 5:32
485,1672," Yes, i agree is a lot of fun to play baseball and also to watch the world series!",3/27/1991 23:40
485,485, ok... That game was really fun... I am also watch the baseball world series.,5/5/2014 13:23
485,485," it is exciting because it consists of a seven game playoff, so it is not just one night, you get to extend the enjoyment many nights",11/5/2010 23:53
485,1672, oh... I definitely play and watch the baseball game. It's really very interesting... ,6/29/2016 5:34
485,485, Well you are right. I hope you have a nice day!,7/9/1979 1:49
485,485, Have you heard of Doug Harey?,3/7/1992 22:04
485,1672, Wasn't he an umpire for the MLB?,1/27/1977 4:24
486,1574, Yes he just died at 87 years of age.,8/3/1986 19:36
486,1574," I guess he was a big deal, and he lived quite a while. He'll be missed though",7/21/1978 7:38
486,1574, He must've been an interesting character to earn the nick name 'God'.,9/14/2007 7:07
486,486, He was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing,3/19/1998 4:09
486,1574," Yup, he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games.",4/23/2016 23:40
486,1574," And five World Series, which is a big leagues in the MLB. He wasn't intimidated by anyone, it seems",12/20/2004 1:16
486,1574, He was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903.,3/4/2015 19:19
486,486, That's incredible! Do you pay attention to baseball much?,10/1/2012 1:02
486,486, No I did when I was younger but lost interest. How bout you?,10/5/1984 8:49
486,1574, Every once in a while. It's one of those sports I would rather play than watch. The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name national pastime from the Americans if they could,7/5/2012 2:30
487,487, Yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too.,5/9/1987 3:29
487,487, Enough that people used to collect baseball cards. One man found a collection in his grandfather's attic that was worth three million dollars,8/15/1982 1:48
487,487, thats a lot of money. are any managers cards worth anything? they do wear the uniform after all.,9/20/2017 8:41
487,487," Probably only if they step in and play the game. I've never seen any of them do it, but that would be an interesting thing to see",6/22/1998 6:29
487,1805," I think that would be fun to see, like the cubs winning the championship after 108 years.",10/3/2004 6:37
487,1805," It would be fun to see them all play kickball sometime. In Canada, they call the game soccer-baseball",3/10/2002 14:08
487,1805, I dont think a couple would schedule all 2430 games throughout 24 years for soccer baseball. like one couple did for baseball.,1/1/1990 14:01
487,487, They might if the game got enough sponsors. They could even play it in extreme conditions like in the snow or on ice. Wearing hockey skates,6/23/1972 18:27
487,487, People would watch it just for the sake of getting together.,10/16/2019 11:53
487,1805," Hey how are you doing, ever have problem with the dust fallout while having your wood floors finished?",3/10/1981 1:57
488,488," Never, lol. have you?",3/30/1987 10:01
488,543," I haven't but if you were wondering, it's best to clean everything before you do so there is no dust to begin with.",7/16/2014 14:21
488,543," That is a good point, start off on the right foot. I wonder if you can buy products on amazon",10/17/1984 17:19
488,488," I'm sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon.",1/11/1977 19:07
488,488," I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can't believe Amazon started in 1994",5/24/1995 9:54
488,488," For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big?",12/15/1991 4:56
488,543," I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly.",4/6/1977 8:03
488,543," For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk.",7/7/1992 20:07
488,488, I couldn't imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount,12/10/1988 5:50
488,543," I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that's surprising.",10/23/2006 6:37
489,1359," I don't know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don't mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb",1/25/2020 5:04
489,1359," Yah, it's just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?",5/30/2004 2:56
489,1359," New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don't get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs",3/19/2011 17:01
489,489," Yah, they're pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains.",9/14/2010 13:51
489,1359, snakes are crazy lol,7/31/1975 11:19
489,489," Truly, very crazy. I'm surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards.",11/22/2000 9:01
489,1359, I would never have guessed that. I wonder what the relationship is,1/23/1987 3:10
489,1359," Not really sure, maybe closer to dinosaurs?",4/28/2013 3:52
489,1359," Yea I think that is it, they say dinosaurs had feathers like birds lol, that would be interesting to see for sure!",12/6/1992 22:46
489,1359," For sure, it was great chatting with you. I hope you have a good rest of the night, take care!",4/12/1998 7:48
490,420, Are you a fan of baseball?,10/6/1984 21:53
490,490," I am, I love the game! What about you?",11/14/1975 13:28
490,420, I don't mind it. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?,12/2/2008 3:55
490,420," Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though.",2/1/1979 13:31
490,420, That's correct. I've never seen it happen either. ,9/10/2021 5:13
490,490," I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year.",4/17/2008 3:00
490,420, Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game. ,11/15/1976 13:48
490,420," Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games.",8/9/1983 16:23
490,420, I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time. ,12/27/2012 3:55
490,420, Did you ever collect baseball cards?,3/11/1991 10:57
491,491, I did not. How about you?,3/2/2017 3:24
491,728, I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s.,12/2/2007 20:11
491,728, Wow! That's amazing. I wish I came across something like that myself. ,3/10/1984 1:44
491,728, Do you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada? ,11/24/1974 6:52
491,728, I did not. That seems like an overly complicated name. ,11/12/1997 21:52
491,728," Poor Canada though, in the 1992 World Series, Marine Corps color guard carried the Canadian Flag into the stadium upside down.",7/20/2019 5:16
491,491, Oh no! That was a major error. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won the world series the Ottoman Empire still existed?,10/12/2006 3:30
491,491, Yep that was such a huge win for them. I heard over 5 million people celebrated in the streets!,4/7/1983 17:27
491,491, I can see why. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then didn't win again until the recent one which was a huge gap in between wins. ,8/27/2012 5:36
491,491, The team was supposedly cursed in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis bring his goat into the stadium.,2/10/1990 4:42
492,492, That is a very strange superstition for them to have. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely night. ,10/9/1980 19:18
492,1787," How's it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs",4/24/1990 13:25
492,1787," I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow!",5/25/1980 23:32
492,1787," Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away",4/26/2020 10:05
492,1787, I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season!,3/26/2010 15:39
492,492," Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903",5/11/1981 22:12
492,492, I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then?,10/12/1981 12:15
492,1787," The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe ",8/28/1996 9:44
492,492," Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time!",7/7/1973 0:29
492,492," Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time",8/11/2021 2:46
493,493, I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life!,4/3/1992 10:25
493,1001," Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game",4/20/1985 15:45
493,493," How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though?",6/13/1996 22:08
493,493," I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times",6/24/1986 10:21
493,493, That's a fun fact! I also hear they're called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there?,5/3/2019 8:58
493,493," No but I'd love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks",5/14/2021 1:46
493,493," I hear that it's a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I'd like to see that.",2/3/2014 20:02
493,493, THat's pretty crazy. I heard Japan has a crazy baseball culture too and are shocked to find out baseball is America's pasttime,1/1/1987 2:42
493,493, I've heard of that and wonder what the food is like at a Japanese baseball game. Do you think they'd serve both sushi and hot dogs?,3/21/1995 0:08
493,1001," Probably, I wonder if Japan has baseball cards like in the US, a guy once found 3 million dollars worth in his grandfathers attic",12/26/2013 1:30
494,494," That sounds like a really cool find, especially if you know the right baseball card collectors. I think I'm gonna go collect some dinner. TTYL!",6/1/2003 15:07
494,494, Have a good one,1/20/1996 14:52
494,494, Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan?,7/31/1987 12:14
494,1139, Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan.,7/17/2009 5:21
494,1139, Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.,12/19/1995 23:07
494,494, You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.,8/18/2018 9:17
494,1139, Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract.,5/23/2000 3:00
494,494, Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.,3/5/2009 2:49
494,494, By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.,10/26/1986 8:57
494,1139, No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.,9/27/1996 22:20
495,495," That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland?",7/4/2004 0:00
495,495, You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.,4/29/2004 6:02
495,495," That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.",10/1/2002 23:16
495,495, I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?,7/2/2021 23:17
495,495," They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.",3/20/1988 23:29
495,1284, Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox,5/2/1991 10:41
495,495, I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.,9/16/1973 17:55
495,495, I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.,12/23/1991 19:50
495,495, Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium.,2/6/2009 9:05
495,1284, I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .,12/22/1973 22:57
496,1482," Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.",10/14/1999 14:47
496,496," You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that.",1/5/1985 17:32
496,1482," I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!",10/29/1994 2:47
496,1482, You're correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!,11/12/2022 0:46
496,496, Take care.,6/17/1984 6:57
496,496," hello, do you watch baseball?",5/26/1986 11:22
496,496," I do, it is my favorite sport. Do you watch? ",12/7/2010 14:41
496,496, I watch it from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,4/13/1974 12:11
496,1482, I think they are technically allowed to play. ,9/21/1998 18:45
496,496," Yeah, good for them, do you know what kickball is called in Canada?",5/30/2010 4:30
497,150," No, do you play kickball? I did for fun a few years ago. ",2/9/1998 3:55
497,150, I do not play it but apparently in Canada it is called soccer-baseball,3/8/1980 21:27
497,497," Awesome, I've only been to Canada once. Have you been? ",2/13/1973 15:36
497,150," Yes, I have friend there so I go all the time. Nice country and nice people",8/11/2010 8:58
497,497, Awesome. Did you know Baseball is super popular in Japan? ,12/11/2013 14:25
497,497, Yeah and they cannot believe that in the US is just a pastime?,11/5/2018 0:19
497,497," yeah, that's awesome. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. ",1/18/1997 2:36
497,497," Nice, good for them. Do you know who used to do the schedule for major baseball laegue",1/3/2015 9:47
497,150," No, do you? Apparently the Ottoman Empire was still in existence when the Cubs won the world series. ",9/29/2008 5:11
497,150, Oh wow that means it goes way back then. Yeah it was a couple who did it for 24 years,3/30/1977 3:41
498,498," Yeah, that is crazy. Apparently the cubs had a player with 6 fingers, doesn't seem possible. ",1/30/1999 21:30
498,498," Wow, that is so interesting indeed. Did you know the women's cup had higher ratings than the world series?",11/8/1989 15:34
498,1092, I can believe it. Some of the games can be boring if you aren't a fan. ,2/2/2014 21:48
498,1092," That is very true. When the CUbs won in 2016, 5 million people celebrated i the streets",5/25/2013 9:41
498,1092," Wow, that must have made a huge mess. They were the first team to win it back to back, but then didn't win again until 2016. ",5/16/1993 0:38
498,498, And the largest in history. Nice chatting with you.,2/1/2017 19:17
498,498, Hi.  Can you play the piano?,11/29/2016 5:33
498,1092," I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.",12/22/2013 22:53
498,498," Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?",6/1/2008 6:09
498,498, That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.,9/24/1980 8:09
499,499, I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.,3/26/2003 5:23
499,499, Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.,8/27/1992 1:52
499,952," I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays",10/3/2006 13:25
499,952," Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!",1/20/1995 12:15
499,499," That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.  ",5/11/2014 2:11
499,499, I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.,10/17/1991 9:31
499,952," That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.",7/5/2020 16:57
499,952," So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.",8/30/2010 4:07
499,499," I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.  Did you know there are No Snakes in New Zealand.",7/15/2009 22:37
499,499," Yeah that's pretty crazy. The only bad thing about owning a snake is the upkeep, it can get expensive.",1/29/1971 2:27
500,500," I bet, is your snake one of the ones that flies?",7/3/2022 7:23
500,319," Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous.",10/30/1985 12:51
500,500, Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city.,3/5/1978 12:34
500,319," Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them.",6/22/1972 0:57
500,319," They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.",9/15/1992 1:06
500,319," I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.",1/13/2004 13:22
500,319, Small ones dont bother me but once they get past a certain size thats a big nope from me.  Roaches freak me out.,4/13/2000 10:07
500,319," Haha yeah roaches are just down right nasty, any way good chatting with you.",2/2/2009 1:09
500,500, Same here have a good day!,4/6/2018 17:29
500,319," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",8/6/1983 3:32
501,1031, Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha,1/26/2012 6:35
501,1031, Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy.,7/10/1984 3:31
501,501," Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh",8/16/2000 11:19
501,501," Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back.",12/2/1993 22:42
501,1031, Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid,10/23/2005 7:40
501,1031," I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure.",4/15/2011 3:29
501,1031," Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL",1/1/2013 1:19
501,501, It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here.,11/15/1970 9:28
501,501," I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha",4/22/1999 7:53
501,1031," That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day.",9/6/2014 13:07
502,502," No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer",8/16/2010 10:05
502,502," The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno.",3/10/2010 13:21
502,1546," haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy!",7/28/2012 6:44
502,502, That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series? I try to.,9/11/2005 8:23
502,1546, No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year,11/15/2009 20:46
502,1546, I like it when an underdog wins. I'm tired of big city teams with big payrolls winning. The Series should bring out the best in the fans and the players. ,1/15/1975 10:10
502,1546, Yep I like that too. What's crazy is that Babe Ruth tried to steal a base in game seven. That's what made him lose the 1926 World Series. Wasn't Babe Ruth really fat?,4/2/1976 8:52
502,502," He was pretty big later on, but he was also a pitcher at one time, so maybe he was speedy. Still, stealing a base? He was a hitter, not a runner.",10/7/1984 17:00
502,502, Yep I agree with you. Pretty cool that the Cubs were the first team to win back-to-back World Series. I know that would be impressive,12/12/1979 0:53
502,502," It was impressive, but then they hit the world's longest losing streak. How? Is it a curse?",1/4/1995 0:15
503,503, Haha well at least the curse has been broken. What's also crazy is that the Women's World Cup had higher television ratings than the World Series in the United States. Personally I think soccer is even worse than baseball so I don't know how that's possible,4/3/1990 5:58
503,784," I'm not really into sports, but I learned a lot about baseball.",11/4/1993 8:50
503,503," Hello, me too, but have you heard about Philadelphia Phillies?",9/19/1978 16:14
503,784, I know a little about them. They have a funny mascot. It looks like Stephen Strasburg is doing well since healing from his injury.,6/6/2005 3:30
503,784," you know that ended in a 5-1 win for Strasburg and the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park and gave the team its first five-game winning streak since the end of May. I was so surprised, can you imagine 5:1...",9/7/1997 21:53
503,784, That's amazing. I can't believe the Nationals have a 19 year old rookie player who is doing so well.,6/28/2021 20:55
503,503," yes that is amazing. He fell behind a couple times and got right back to throwing strikes. He did really, really well. Do you know Aaron Nola?",12/29/2011 20:14
503,784, I have never heard of him. Is he a good player too?,2/18/1996 4:20
503,503," Yes hi is. he Phillies' Aaron Nola has been one of the National League's best and is right behind Max Scherzer and the New York Mets' Jacob deGrom in the Cy Young conversation, that's the information I have learned",5/16/1995 12:38
503,503, That's something. I thought it was interesting that all othe game scheduling was done through a married couple until 2005. I wonder who handles it now. ,5/4/2004 4:05
504,497," yes me either. Then it was a nerve impingement in his neck. Now Strasburg is inching back into form, one start at a time, even if most of his fastballs are still registering in the low 90s. ",7/23/2000 0:45
504,504, The low 90s is pretty fast for someone with that kind of injury. I also didn't know the game was so popular in Japan.,4/20/1981 20:23
504,504," Me too, can you believe, in Japan...  I also learned that Ryan Zimmerman added a run-scoring single three hitters later and a solo home run in the fourth that sneaked just above Odubel Herrera's glove and into the bushes beyond the center field wall.",4/13/1996 7:05
504,504," That must've been so awful for Odubel Herrera, to just miss catching the ball. It was probably quite a sight to see in person. ",1/20/1973 16:57
504,504," yes I guess so... Can you believe that he Phillies right-hander never hit a stride in five innings of work, while Strasburg was only scratched by J.P. Crawford's solo homer to start the fifth?",12/14/2009 3:38
504,497, I guess people sometimes have off games. Hopefully he'll be able to get out of that slump. ,6/12/1993 19:43
504,497," yes that's for sure. Nationals pent the past month hovering on either side of mediocrity, trading key players to contending teams, watching their playoff hopes come and go with the summer. But the Nationals have shown a lot of life in the past five days, if only a week or two too late, I am very impressed, what about you?",6/23/1973 3:39
504,504, They are turning out to be an impressive team. Hopefully they'll make better decisions and continue to play well enough to go on to the world series. I am learning quite a bit about the team in this conversation. ,11/6/1973 17:08
504,497, yes exactly. do you like baseball? ,6/19/1977 3:10
504,504," I like watching it in person. Not so much on TV. It's more exciting to be there. I've only been to one pro game with a friend who's really into the game -- I think it was the Nationals many years ago. I don't recall who they played or what the score was, but it was a fun afternoon.",12/11/2003 5:41
505,505, Yes I like to watch it from home with my friends lol  and did you know that Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?,10/30/1980 10:59
505,505, Wow. I did not know that. I wonder if any of the managers are any good...,3/13/2009 21:31
505,1107, it was nice to chat,12/6/2018 21:34
505,505," Hello,  do you like baseball?",4/13/1986 9:40
505,505, You bet. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform?,11/23/1981 1:16
505,505," I believe its because they are able to play in the game if needed. Thats kinda cool,  I hope they never have to though.  ",5/25/2014 0:50
505,1107, Yeah it is pretty cool. I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously,5/28/2012 10:53
505,1107, I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol ,5/15/2014 18:38
505,1107, Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games?,6/26/1971 12:41
505,1107," Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy!",8/11/2008 10:38
506,506, Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row,10/23/1992 0:43
506,506," Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though. ",6/24/1992 20:19
506,506, Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat,10/10/1985 4:24
506,296, I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program.,5/6/1989 6:43
506,506, Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded?,5/25/2000 14:43
506,506, No I dont.  When?,2/15/2017 14:42
506,296, It was founded in 1903 and at that time even the ottoman empire was in existence still,5/10/2000 23:28
506,296, Interesting.  did you know the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series?,10/3/1994 17:00
506,296, Yes they were but then they were cursed or something because they have not won anymore since then,6/16/1993 13:07
506,296," I hear they actually did win again,  in 2016.",5/26/2006 9:32
507,748, Oh right when they had that huge celebration with 5 million people out in the streets,3/10/2014 6:14
507,748," Yes,  the largest gathering of humans in history!!",7/11/2003 17:26
507,507, That is pretty impressive. Did you know the Cubs are one of the oldest teams in MLB?,4/25/1975 8:44
507,507, I did not! Thats cool.  ITs been great talking to you. ,3/22/2003 19:05
507,748," Hello there, are you a fan of baseball?",10/26/1994 9:30
507,507, Yes.  I was an assistant scout for the Phillies years ago.  Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005?,4/22/2011 11:27
507,748," Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job?",4/29/1977 3:58
507,507," I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada.",8/4/2018 12:04
507,748," Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that. ",7/18/2015 15:16
507,748, It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms.,12/9/1984 21:55
508,1906," Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports?",4/9/2000 11:05
508,508, I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.  ,1/22/2005 16:34
508,508," Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat. ",8/23/2006 9:49
508,1906," Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.  Some of Japan's baseball fans are surprised that it is such a big deal in the US.",12/23/1995 12:12
508,1906, Yeah I know Japanese people are really into baseball.  Did you watch the world series this year?,7/24/2018 22:52
508,508, Yes.  The American League champ plays the National League champ and the NL is not doing so well lately.,12/16/2019 6:13
508,508, Yeah my team was one game away from representing the NL in the series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the series way back in 1926?,9/10/1984 11:03
508,1906, That was not a good baseball decision trying to steal that base. ,10/11/1985 2:38
508,508, No that doesn't sound like it.  But I think he made up for it quite a bit.  Do you know who the first team to win back to back world series was?,2/7/2003 15:38
508,1906," Yes.  The Cubs.  The last time they won, the Ottoman Empire still existed.",12/8/1978 6:33
509,509, Yeah good call.  Are you a fan of the Cubs at all?,12/10/2017 23:58
509,1728, I do like them.  Their stadium is so old and so classic.  I guess what I said about the Ottoman Empire was wrong.  They won in 2016 also.,11/2/1985 7:16
509,1728," Yeah they did, maybe that was the last time they won their back to back series. ",1/15/1971 3:21
509,509, I live in Phoenix and the Diamondbacks won in 2001.  I could not imagine going 108 years without winning like the Cubs did.,7/23/1991 23:08
509,509, Yeah our manager was a hero for you in that final game back then.  Well I haven't seen one in my lifetime I am ready!  It was nice talking with you. ,12/10/2009 12:31
509,1728, Do you follow baseball?,7/17/2004 20:26
509,509, Yes. I am a dodger fan,3/1/1980 14:37
509,509, Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?  ,4/29/2001 15:04
509,1728," No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago",6/29/2016 5:31
509,509, I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed?,11/1/2006 17:04
510,340, Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that,12/26/2017 6:33
510,510, Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them.,2/14/1981 22:25
510,340, Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back,8/18/1981 7:14
510,340, They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,5/14/1979 1:59
510,510, Yes. I had heard that before.,1/7/1974 1:22
510,340, I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year.,6/2/1976 19:51
510,340, That sounds like a heck of a big job.,5/20/1981 23:41
510,510, I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.  First time I've ever seen that fact.,1/13/2009 10:08
510,340, I have never heard that before. ,2/27/1985 11:41
510,340, First time for me as well.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan and many fans there are surprised to find out it's known as America's national pastime?,12/17/2004 12:02
511,511, Yes. Baseball has been big in Japan for a long time,9/11/2006 11:35
511,511, I find it interesting how they name the teams.  Surprised we don't see that here.  We could see the Walmart Cashiers playing the Target Bullseyes. lol,5/19/1980 18:38
511,511," The  Dodgers are called the Dodgers because their fans in Brooklyn Had to Dodge trollys to get to the Stadium. They were called trolly Dodgers, Then shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers",9/29/1984 0:37
511,270, That is interesting!  I honestly never knew that!    The womens cup had higher tv ratings than the world series in the US.  That kind of shows the sport is on a downtrend like the cards.,4/29/1996 3:29
511,270, I never Knew that. But baseball is a slow paced game. I guess the kids like faster paced sports,4/22/1971 4:15
511,270, Yes.  They are into video games now (too much if you ask me).  It's been fun talking ball with you!  I enjoyed it.  Have a good day!,7/29/1993 2:53
511,270, do you like baseball?,4/6/2016 6:50
511,270, I do and watch it quite a bit and you?,7/6/1973 0:22
511,511, Me too. do you know why the managers wear uniforms?,12/27/1994 21:49
511,511," I am not sure of that actually, did not notice. Why?",10/19/2017 1:36
512,512, Yes because they can play if their team needs them to,10/10/1975 4:51
512,1896, Nice. DO you know how many balls are used during a MLB season?,9/12/1971 7:09
512,1896, Hmm I have no idea but I know that a couple did the schedule for 24 years for those games,12/6/1977 18:41
512,1896, Wow that is a lot and they use 160000 balls per season,7/28/1988 23:18
512,1896, Now that is a low. Did you hear about that guy who made 3 million from old baseball cards?,4/20/1993 22:02
512,1896," WOw no, where did he find all those cards?",11/10/2003 18:13
512,1896," In the attic, they were his grandfather's. How lucky",10/27/2019 13:56
512,1896, I know. A female pitcher at just the age of 17 once took out Babe Ruth and was banned after that,12/17/2005 14:02
512,512, Wow that is impressive too bad and unfair she got banned though,12/3/2022 10:56
512,512, Exactly. Women's world cup has more viewers than the Works Series,12/9/1995 22:11
513,1326, Do you know when the World Series was founded?,9/19/1996 13:56
513,513," Yes that was back in 9013, so over 100 years old now",9/17/2012 0:29
513,1326, yeah it is pretty old. They were around when the ottoman empire was around too,7/15/1991 23:50
513,1326, Wow that feels really old. Do you know which team has lost the most championships?,2/21/1974 14:25
513,513," Hmm I do not know that, which team is that?",8/6/1986 16:44
513,1326," That is the dodgers, poor guys must be beating themselves about it",2/16/1970 13:37
513,1326, I know. The Cubs were the only team to win back to back world series and then nothing for a long time,6/23/2020 17:56
513,1326, Wow they must have struck bad luck after that,1/20/1989 2:44
513,513," Hello there, do you watch baseball?",4/19/2022 8:48
513,1326, I sure do from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform?,5/1/1983 6:02
514,514, Yeah they wear them because they are technically allowed to play if it need be,8/12/1970 23:53
514,514, Yes exactly. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,1/7/1970 3:50
514,514," I think it is called soccer-baseball, is it not?",1/11/2014 23:44
514,514," Yes it is, a combination of both games. In Japan seems to be a really popular game",2/28/2015 7:15
514,730, Yup they are so into the game that they cannot believe it is just a pastime here,9/5/1998 5:10
514,730, Yeah exactly. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for major league games?,8/19/1990 11:28
514,730, I hear there was this couple who did it for 24 years in a row,3/7/2012 19:18
514,514," That is amazing, 2430 games every year that is just too many numbers for me",4/28/2013 23:36
514,730, It sure is for me too. THe ottoman empire was in existence when the world series started,7/12/1987 10:01
514,514, Wow that means it started really early this whole thing with baseball. ,1/17/2009 4:54
515,896, Yes it started back in 1903. The Cubs were the only team to win back to back championships ,12/11/1991 16:58
515,515, Yes and they have not won since then so I wonder what happened there,11/7/2011 12:00
515,515, Yeah one wonders right? Women's world cup on the other hand has higher ratings than the world series. ,10/6/2012 8:11
515,515, That is pretty impressive. The largest gathering in human history was when the Cubs won the world series in 2016,6/7/2005 5:30
515,515, Yeah I heard more than 5 million people were put celebrating,2/2/1995 11:01
515,896," Yeah that is insane. The Cubs are one of the oldest teams in MLB, along with Atlanta Braves.",9/5/2021 3:48
515,515," That is pretty cool. And they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers in their pitching hand",11/26/1974 10:35
515,515," Nice, that sounds interesting. They are also one of the oldest teams in MLB",12/27/2003 7:39
515,896, Yeah. They were once believe to have been cursed when security did not let a guy with a smelly goat in the stadium,2/20/2019 16:36
515,896," Hello,  do you like baseball?",2/13/1996 0:20
516,749," Hey I do like baseball! Did you know that managers can actually play baseball? that's why they wear the uniforms, just in case the need arises, then they can play for the team",3/15/1970 11:40
516,516," Yeah I did,  thats pretty awesome.  Hopefully they dont have to though,  most of them are a bit older.  Theres like 20 players on a team though,  shouldnt have the need. ",6/9/1978 21:25
516,749," No I agree with you. Have you ever played kickball when you were in school? Apparently in Canada, it's not called kickball, it's called soccer baseball LOL",8/26/1983 15:59
516,749," I did, used to love kickball,  I feel like kickball is a more appropriate name for it,  what does soccer mean?",12/23/1970 5:44
516,749," I know right! I definitely think that kickball is the right word. It's the best way to describe it, what would you do if you found millions of dollars of baseball cards in your attic by the way?",2/9/1976 6:28
516,516," Wow well pay off my car and cc's,  go on a small vacation and put the rest in savings or investments,  then continue my life.  how about you?",7/21/2013 6:40
516,749, Haha I would do something similar. Definitely pay off my student loans and everything. And probably retire LOL. I can't believe that some guy found 3 million dollars worth of those cards in his grandfather's attic though. What a lucky guy,3/14/1985 5:28
516,516," I know thats amazing.  That would be really nice,  my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol ",3/13/1989 11:13
516,516," Haha yes that's too bad, mine did not either. Have you ever been to Japan by the way? Apparently baseball is really huge over there",5/5/2009 5:17
516,749," I have a trip planned for next jan to Japan!  No I had no idea that baseball was big there,  maybe I can catch a game!",5/12/2022 12:51
517,809, You should! I've heard that the crowds are super Rowdy haha. You're not married are you? It's weird that a married couple with scheduling all of the MLB baseball games for about 24 years,1/22/1995 10:23
517,809," Yes I am happily married!  That seems like they put a lot of time into baseball,  they must really love it",8/23/1979 1:24
517,517, I think so. You ever watch the World Series by the way? I haven't watched it in a really long time myself,8/11/1993 20:30
517,517," I have watched it a few times,  especially if the sf giants are in it!",6/11/1985 0:37
517,809," So is that your favorite team? I like the Tigers, and I also like the Yankees LOL oh, did you know that the Women's World Cup soccer had a higher television rating than the World Series? And that was in the United States too, I wonder how that's possible",10/18/1974 6:03
517,517," Haha wow thats crazy.  Yes,  I love the SF Giants!",10/28/1974 1:24
517,517, What do you think about the Chicago Cubs by the way? Apparently after they won in 2016 about 5 million people were celebrating in the streets,1/31/1996 11:56
517,809, Good for them.  I dont think they have won in a long time lol I cant imagine 5 billion people in the streets though. ,10/18/1979 15:13
517,809, Nope Chicago must have been really partying that day LOL. Did you know that they were the first team to win back-to-back World Series's?,12/4/2010 0:52
517,517, Been good chatting,1/12/2001 17:19
518,518," Hello, have you heard that one of the chicago cubs have an employed pitcher with 6 fingers?",9/4/1993 11:36
518,518," No, The cubs are one two major teams in chicago.",1/11/2003 14:45
518,518, I am guessing the second one is the Atlanta Braves.,1/19/2000 15:44
518,518," Yes, The chicago cubs won the 2016 world series, people celebrated in the streets, making largest gatherings  in human history.",6/1/2018 18:54
518,1368," Well, they were the first team to win straight on the world series til 2016.",10/24/1987 14:01
518,518, The chicago cubs were the first team win back to back .,2/18/1986 23:52
518,518," That is true. However, the Chicago Cubs were somewhat cursed.",6/11/2020 0:41
518,1368, For this only the cubs did not play in a world series again until 2016.,2/17/1975 18:39
518,518, It was right after a refusal towards a man with a smelly goat going into the stadium.,10/27/1992 10:05
518,518," Yes, I hear the new. Baseball managers wear uniform because they are technically able to play for their team when need arises.",4/26/2001 1:06
519,1768, I bet they get as much compensation as the other team players.,1/17/1979 2:54
519,519, They are very fanatic for their team should win. You ever played baseball ?,6/4/1982 18:54
519,519, I hardly play baseball. I watch the game whenever there is a Giants game coming up.,8/9/2007 13:17
519,1768, What your Favourite game ?,6/30/1974 7:49
519,519," The Giants. Unless, you're talking about sports. My favorite sport is basketball.",10/18/1974 8:10
519,519, Kickball is also called soccer baseball in canada.,2/19/1982 4:36
519,1768," Yes, have you ever played kickball? Physical education teachers let the students play kickball in the states, as well.",8/12/1981 8:48
519,1768," Yes, baseball is very popular in japan.",8/6/2011 7:17
519,519, Do you think that baseball started in Japan or the states?,6/30/2004 18:04
519,1768, United state national sports is base ball. I know it.,9/3/2004 0:38
520,520, I see. Nice to talk to someone who has a good knowledge on baseball.,8/24/2006 0:30
520,1275," The Braves seem to have a good start on the season, they are the most rested team",6/3/2009 4:15
520,1275," Hi, how are you? I don't really know the Braves. They're a big market team, so I expect them to get marquee players.",7/23/2016 3:09
520,1275," They have a good team, so there are two points of view, a well reseted team vs a team that comes into season with a lot of practice, which one do you prefer?",2/9/1989 15:18
520,1275," I would practice. I think skills get rusty. Baseball is a team sport, so they should work together. Other teams will have practiced.",4/17/2012 6:31
520,1275," I  think practice is better, a well rested team might begin with some troubles, games are neccesary to adapt.",10/12/1997 15:20
520,520," Yes, I would want people to practice. They need to prepare for the season. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?",6/3/2005 6:40
520,1275," Ive always wondered about that, do you know if it ever happened in a game?",1/8/2002 21:13
520,1275," I suppose back in the day one of the players was chosen to be manager. Handled both jobs. Now, not necessary.",10/6/1981 0:30
520,1275," I see well the game is really popular in Japan, seems like it has a lot of fans over there",5/15/2002 2:44
521,521, The game is very popular. I think that the Japanese have made their own version of it. Uniquely Japanese.,7/27/2002 16:31
521,99," They did? wow, they must really like it them did you watch the Wold Series last year?",1/5/2012 9:17
521,521, I didn't get the chance to watch a lot of it. I know that the Dodgers lost again.,3/19/2020 19:27
521,99," I didnt watch it either, its a game with a lot of tradition almost 120 years since the first World Series, so 120 champions",10/12/1972 3:06
521,521, The Cubbies won back to back WS. Then after that? It's like a curse. What should they do?,12/5/2001 1:32
521,521," They should get like an exorcism done by all religions lol, it does seem like a curse",3/3/1979 20:36
521,99," The sports is popular here, but not around the world. The women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the united states.",12/3/2006 9:05
521,521," It did? guess not only the mens category is popular then, before 1969 the team with the best record would advanced to the WS that has changed now",5/26/1976 23:56
521,521," I think the playoffs are fun, but probably a good way to get more money. The fans don't seem to mind.",12/3/1973 7:39
521,521," So the Chicago Cubs and their curse, to think the Cubs and the Braves are the oldest teams in the league",9/12/1986 3:46
522,522," The Braves have moved a lot, I think. Weren't they in another city?",11/12/1981 19:45
522,522," Not sure about that, but I think they were yeah. ",12/11/2002 5:12
522,522, Do you play or watch baseball? ,7/25/1987 20:25
522,522," Hey, I've played, but honestly not a big fan. How about you?",5/2/2017 7:45
522,528," I used to follow it really closely, and played in highschool. But they changed the strike zone to be smaller so now the games are less exciting to me because I was a pitcher. ",2/21/2000 5:26
522,528, Really? It's interesting. Do you know why baseball is popular in Japan?,4/12/2003 8:30
522,522," No i don't actually, but I hear it is popular there. Do you  know why? I'm curious.",4/22/1974 11:57
522,528," I honestly never heard about it, but read couple minutes ago. I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well. ",6/21/1998 22:40
522,528," Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?> ",12/3/2002 17:53
522,522," I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play ",11/8/2003 8:43
523,523," I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other. ",11/24/1991 3:37
523,242, Absolutely. Have you read an article about Chicago Cubs recently?,3/26/2008 1:13
523,242," No, I didn't see it. Apparently when they won the 2016 series 5 million people celebrated. ",8/28/1978 8:31
523,242, It also was the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series. I actually didn't know it.,7/1/1996 0:53
523,523, Awesome. They are one of the oldes teams.,4/19/1971 11:04
523,523, True. As well as Atlanta Braves. It's wonderful! ,1/13/1994 11:00
523,523, I didn't know that. The Cubs were cursed in 1945 when they would let Billy Sianis stay in the stadium. ,12/4/1992 12:54
523,242, It's sounds like a mystery. Just difficult to believe lol,8/3/1989 9:04
523,242, I didn't now they were known as the North Siders. Did you know that? ,12/29/1970 17:01
523,242," It's also new fact for me, I didn't know. Honestly, I don't have good knowledge in history of  baseball. How about you?",7/26/2001 15:01
524,524," Sort of, babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the world series and they lost. ",4/13/2006 10:16
524,524," Yes, I know that, but it was long long time ago. Even the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubds won the World series. It was also long time ago",11/22/1988 4:24
524,1553," Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Chicago to be honest. But I'm happy they won. ",6/18/1998 22:25
524,1553," Hello, do you like baseball?",6/21/2016 0:24
524,524," Hi, I watch a little.  How about you?",4/9/2019 23:32
524,1553, Baseball is my favorite sport. Did you know that managers are technically able to play for their teams?,12/14/1975 13:02
524,524, I wonder why they wore those uniforms.  I wonder if one has actually ever played?,7/12/1980 1:14
524,1553, The only one I can think if is Pete Rose who regularly played as manager. Do you have a favorite team?,7/25/1992 7:51
524,1553," My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves, from the days of Chipper Jones.  What's your favorite team?",11/1/2015 21:26
524,1553," Mine is the Dodgers. I have to admire that team that Atlanta had, their pitching staff was something else.",5/22/1994 22:54
525,525," I hear in Japan, baseball is so popular that some Japanese people are shocked to find out that its America's national pastime.",2/21/2022 1:35
525,1554, So I've heard. Do you think that Japan should ever be allowed to compete for the world championship?,8/7/1981 10:34
525,525," Sure, why not?  They have some pretty good players, actually. ",5/18/2019 16:36
525,1554, They do. I have always been a little upset because the US always considers their sports teams as world champs but yet don't have to prove it.,10/27/1991 1:01
525,1554," That's so true! Hey, did you hear about the man that found all those old baseball cards in his grandfather's attic?",1/8/1973 20:59
525,1554, Yeah that was quite a find. I had no idea that baseball cards were so valuable.,7/20/2013 2:38
525,1554, Me either.  Did you watch the World Series?,10/29/1988 13:45
525,1554," I did watch the world series, and as you can imagine I was once again disappointed in the Dodgers. Did you know that in 1992 the US marines carried the canadian flag upside down?",4/14/1990 13:47
525,525, I can believe it.  lol Which way does that leaf go anyway?,12/23/2010 11:56
525,525, To tell you the truth I would have to look it up. But what an embarrassment. ,1/4/1978 19:41
526,20," I know right, I think I would have googled it,, before walking out!",6/4/2016 17:14
526,526, Me too. I feel sorry for the Marine who was carrying it. I'm sure things didn't go well for him.,11/8/2016 16:16
526,20," He probably had to scrub the latrine with his toothbrush.  Oh well, now he knows, I bet he won't forget it! Did you hear about the curse of the goat?",9/8/1986 8:41
526,526," No, what is the curse of the goat?",10/7/2020 0:31
526,20," Apparently, the Cubs were cursed  after security would not let a man bring his goat into the stadium in 1945.  He cursed the team and they did not play in a World Series again until 2016.",10/3/1987 17:00
526,526," Wow. Remind me to be nice to goats. Thanks for the interesting chat, and have a nice day.",3/26/1992 5:39
526,20, Are you a baseball fan? ive never really enjoyed watching on tv don't have the patience for it.,11/23/1970 8:26
526,20," I prefer football but my granddaughter likes to watch baseball games on tv.  So, I watch with her.",5/3/1979 23:20
526,20, That's cool! Apparently it's so popular in Japan that there surprised it's our (Americas) past time. ,9/13/2008 15:57
526,526," Yes, I heard about that.  Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players.",9/12/1983 11:39
527,527, I wonder if that's ever happened before? Did you know that baseball use to be referred to as the Fall classics?,7/25/1984 3:45
527,244," I will research about it later.  No, I did not know that (the fall classics).",4/15/2011 17:34
527,527, Because in north america it is played during the fall season. ,3/6/2001 22:42
527,244, I see.  Thank you for the information.  A married couple used to schedule all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years.  ,5/22/1992 10:59
527,244, That must of been pretty cool for them to do together. so the baseball season is how many games. do you know?,9/24/1984 18:56
527,244," 2430 games, I think.  I might be wrong.",3/30/1977 20:32
527,527," That's a lot of games, no wonder pitcher arms get burned out. Just to refresh my memory a run is scored when a player legally crosses the bases, right?",3/9/2018 12:13
527,244, A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases and touches home plate.,8/13/2011 18:35
527,527," Right, and the team that scores the most points wins. Why is the word legally used can you get bases illegally? ",4/8/2011 5:03
527,244, I don't know why the specifically use the word legally.   ,4/30/1998 3:53
528,528, Now there is a such thing as stealing a base right? Some one told me that the ottoman empire was still in existence win the cubs won the world series. ,3/25/1975 10:26
528,528," My granddaughter knows much more about baseball.  I think you are right, there is such a thing as stealing a base. Babe Ruth was caught doing it to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series.",12/8/1988 17:02
528,786, Wow that had to hurt. I heard that the Chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back super bowls and haven;t won since. ,2/25/2003 16:31
528,786," I think what you meant was World Series since Super bowl is for football games.  Yes, you are right about Chicago Cubs winning back to back.",12/17/2003 16:53
528,786, Oh right thank you for the correction. Did you know that the women's cup had more tv rating that the world series. ,1/23/1971 4:30
528,786," Yes, I heard about it.  Isn't it amazing?",4/16/1996 5:06
528,528," It is, good for them! After the Cubs won the world series in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. ",2/16/2007 8:43
528,528," Yes, apparently it was one of the largest gathering in human history.  I've got to run.  It was nice chatting with you.  Have a great day!",4/16/2013 17:46
528,528, Do you follow basebal? The Nationals traded Daneil Murphy and Matt Adams,4/3/2003 15:42
528,528, Yes I do. I didn't know that. Who's your favorite team?,1/10/1993 8:26
529,791," I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires",9/12/1975 16:48
529,529," It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee.",6/4/1996 3:32
529,529, They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was,5/8/2002 2:27
529,791, I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over.,2/17/2005 9:27
529,529, That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series,7/19/1971 10:09
529,791, Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat.,1/22/1999 5:38
529,529, Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power,9/6/2001 1:59
529,791, Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game.,10/1/1972 10:08
529,791," I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink",11/28/2010 10:30
529,529, Probably so. Did you know the Cubs and Braves started playing the same year as the battle of the little bighorn?,4/22/1974 12:14
530,530," That is pretty crazy, I wonder if any of the people from the Battle of Little Bighorn ever saw a Cubs game",4/1/1988 5:06
530,1754," I don't know. How do you feel about people today complaining about teams that are named after Native Americans, like the Braves?",8/6/1992 0:40
530,1754," Depends on how respectful it's done, the Braves don't have a bad logo but the Indians logo is pretty messed up",7/14/1988 0:57
530,530," The native americans don't seem to have a problem with it. It's just other people, strange.",4/14/1994 1:21
530,1754," I wonder if there are any baseball controversies in Japan, baseball is really popular there",5/14/1974 2:16
530,530," Yes it is, and they have some pretty good players. I wonder if they will ever be allowed to play for the world series.",4/10/1991 6:27
530,530," Maybe one day, but for now it's just between the AL and NL champions",12/16/2010 22:20
530,530," True, but we Americans have a habit of declaring ourselves world champs in almost all the sports. Just doesn't seem right.",2/24/1974 11:21
530,1754," Well I got to go, nice chatting with you",1/24/1990 12:25
530,530, hey there do you like baseball? Its the game that uses a ball and a bat,10/21/2009 8:27
531,1449," I do!  And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball.",1/1/2013 11:46
531,531," Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms",2/17/1987 6:12
531,531," Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch!",3/12/2007 9:53
531,531, Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them?,5/23/1983 18:32
531,1449," Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.  ",3/5/2011 8:36
531,531," Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason",3/2/2002 8:47
531,1449," I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball.",10/18/2013 5:06
531,1449, Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan,12/14/1972 4:09
531,1449," It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either.",1/7/2008 22:53
531,531, Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself.,5/12/1974 2:51
532,532, I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups.,10/17/1994 2:14
532,787," Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history.",11/9/2020 12:48
532,787, The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.  That is a long time.,7/4/2009 17:37
532,787," Yeah that is a long time, and apparently the Ottoman Empire was still a thing back when they first one at haha",11/16/2004 3:53
532,532," Wow, I guess I hadnt realized they had overlapped.  Did you hear about how they were cursed",4/13/1981 17:05
532,532, yes I heard about that! Its great that they finally broke the curse and 5 million people were celebrating in the streets!,11/26/2003 21:04
532,787, Supposedly it was one of the largest gatherings in Human history.,8/28/2016 6:18
532,532," ya you're right, I do like that they have employed handicapped players, they have had pitchers with 4,5 and 6 fingers! ",8/5/2019 15:55
532,532," That is really cool.  I remember Jim Abbott, the one armed player.  I wonder who he played for?",5/29/1980 14:19
532,787," I'm not sure I havne't heard of him, but ya I also like the cubs because they, along with the braves, are the oldest MLB teams, great chat btw!",12/3/1995 12:01
533,1267, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),4/19/1977 18:31
533,1267, Thanks! Do you follow baseball?  Did you know that managers can actually play for their team if needed so that is why they suit up?,1/26/1979 5:49
533,533," I heard something like that, but I wonder how often was that actually implemented in the game. Did You ever see something like that ?",4/11/1974 15:43
533,533, I never saw that.  But I've played kickball.  Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?,8/29/1985 1:53
533,1267, soccer-baseball ;) that's a first... is even kick ball popular in Canada ? Do You know ?,7/19/2007 2:56
533,1267, I don't know for sure.  But baseball is really popular in Japan and fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime,5/19/2005 6:59
533,533, In Japan ? Are You sure ? I didn't know Japan played baseball. Did you ?,11/18/2019 8:56
533,533, Yes! They play well at the Little League World Series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the '26 world series with his team only down by one run,2/10/1990 20:15
533,533," yeah, Mr. Ruth was quite a legend... have You watched games with him ? Pretty exciting thing to see...",7/8/1976 22:59
533,533," I've seen movies.  In the 1992 World Series, the U.S. Marine corps color guard carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down",10/5/1998 18:03
534,534, wow... that was the last time he did that probably... I hope it was not intentional... ;),7/12/2001 3:45
534,1462, The Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since,1/21/1984 12:40
534,534," wow, this must suck for them and their managers ;) such high expectations every year probably and then bum... back to square one...",7/26/1995 13:48
534,534," The Cubs have had pitchers with a varying number of fingers including 4,5 and 6.  Do you know any of those pitchers?",3/23/1987 16:06
534,534," sorry I don't, do you ?",12/31/1993 21:27
534,1462," No not sure, but one team had a one-handed pitched who did an amazing job named Jim Abbott",3/6/1981 18:26
534,534, not bad... I'm sure that one hand was insured for a lot of money ;),9/16/2008 17:06
534,1462, The Braves hadn't been in the playoffs for a while but made it this year.,9/17/1985 21:47
534,534," Good for them, were You cheering for them ?",4/1/1980 6:20
534,534, No way.  How about you?,8/9/1990 15:12
535,535," Naah, me neither ;) I don't care much for that sport - sorry, I'm from Europe, we have different interests I guess... ",7/8/2018 17:15
535,1436," Nice talking.  If you find old major league baseball cards, they could be worth millions.  A man found 3 million dollars worth in his grandpa's attic",5/3/1990 22:38
535,535, I'll start looking right now ;) thank You for the chat ,8/14/2014 13:59
535,535, Have a good day!,6/10/1973 22:20
535,1436, When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards?,8/11/1998 12:28
535,535," That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you?",1/21/1985 12:29
535,1436," I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all?",6/24/1973 21:48
535,535," Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that?",2/26/1985 12:41
535,535," Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?",12/31/1980 15:55
535,535," My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow!",9/14/2006 3:21
536,536, Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse?,9/20/1993 10:35
536,536," Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat. ",4/25/1979 22:59
536,536, The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still.,3/30/1970 20:48
536,1756," I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.",4/6/2022 21:23
536,536, I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.,3/11/1979 7:41
536,1756," Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange.",8/15/1996 18:18
536,536, Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers. I do not know why my dad likes that team,7/29/1994 12:41
536,536," Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true!",11/21/2008 0:07
536,1756, Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed?,8/1/1980 6:10
536,1756," I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.  ",11/11/2017 9:44
537,537," They started out so good, they were the first team to win back to back. seems kinda weird maybe baseball is fixed.",6/6/1996 21:03
537,537," I've said that before, myself!  Did you know the great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series with his team down by one run?",9/19/1990 22:37
537,526," People do not care even if it is fixed, they still wanna watch it. in 2005 a couple scheduled 2430 games!",4/17/1995 12:51
537,537," Yeah, I heard that they did that for 24 years.  They must be very organized to keep all those schedules straight.",3/8/2007 23:01
537,526," Baseball is a fun sport, I like seeing it in person live. Have you ever seen baseball in person?",8/8/2004 22:46
537,537," Yes, I have seen many baseball games in my lifetime.  I still love it just as much as I did when I was a kid, playing.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to get to work.  I'll talk to you later, friend.",5/22/2005 18:58
537,537," The Braves sure are a pupular team, they seem to be well rested for the playoffs",8/7/2001 1:17
537,537, Is that good or bad.  They have had no real good teams to play against.,2/27/1989 9:31
537,537," I think its a bad thing, practice is everything and not playing enough games can result in lack of chemistry",2/17/1971 12:24
537,526," Thursday at 8:07 am eastern time, the Braves play their first playoff game since 2013.  Many new players going to playoffs for first time.",11/9/2017 8:31
538,1105, They have many young players so its going to be a great experience for them hope that they can make it,10/8/1976 23:23
538,538," As long as they do not forget that runners advance counter clock wise around four bases to score a run, they will be fine.",3/2/2005 16:43
538,1105," Yeah I think they have a great team so as long as they remember the rules everything is going to be ok, the manager can always step in and play with them",7/17/1999 8:00
538,538, I guess thats why the manager dresses like a player.  Is there really a rule that catching a ball in a players hat gives the other team three bases?,5/2/2010 22:00
538,538," I dont know I haven't seen that, then again I dont watch many of the games, baseball is really popular in Japan so maybe they know if its true over there",1/21/2010 9:01
538,538, Baseball came from Japan.  Makes sense.  The pitcher throws a ball which the opposing team tries to hit with a bat.,8/25/2000 16:14
538,538, Oh so the game originated in Japan? baseball card collectors can have a hidden fortune and people wouldnt know,10/17/2005 15:42
538,538, The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.  But when do the teams trade cards?  Seems hard to advance around bases and hand out cards.,10/14/2004 3:34
538,1105," I dont think they trade cards, well maybe many of them do, a man found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his basements, some can cost a lot",8/18/1975 20:04
538,538," Are baseballs worth anything?  There are 160,000 baseballs used in a major league season.  ",3/11/1975 13:37
539,1063," I guess they are, specially important baseballs from decisive home runs or such, ",5/30/1975 9:44
539,539," I see.  Interesting.  So, for the Simpsons home town of Springfield it is not known what state they are in.  But the Simpsons minor league baseball team is the Isotopes. See what I am getting at?",11/2/2002 14:04
539,539," Yeah I can follow,  the Isotopes were pretty bad in the Simpsons, I guess reality is not different lol ",8/19/1979 0:06
539,539, That means that the Simpsons are in New Mexico.  You knew that all this time.  Impressive.  Ronald Reagan was a radio broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs in the 1930's.  ,10/16/2016 9:33
539,1063," He was? that would be interesting to hear lol,their stadium got cursed back in 1945",12/25/1975 0:57
539,539, Reagan must have had an interesting life. The Chicago Cubs used to be the Chicago Orphans.  Weird.  What happens in 1945?,9/6/1978 18:03
539,1063," The team got cursed back in 1945, a man named Billy Sianis wasnt allowed in and he cursed the team. The curse worked!!!",11/9/1992 6:34
539,1063, do you like the piano?,2/1/1979 9:07
539,1063," I love it  is such a classic instrument, and you?",4/30/2007 0:54
539,539, Me too. BBC once played piano tunes all day instead of the news,3/23/1971 18:33
540,377, Yeah because there was no newsworthy news that day,7/5/2022 8:50
540,540, Yeah. Did you know Mercury and McCartney used the same piano to compose their songs?,4/4/2011 19:44
540,377," Yes Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude, respectively",3/19/1996 21:18
540,540, Yeah. Have you heard of circus gallop?,9/7/1982 19:06
540,377, Yes that is the stress testing tune for pianos right?,6/11/1994 0:52
540,377," Yes that one but no human can play it, strange",12/12/1989 12:47
540,540, Yes I know. THere is a piano on top of the tallest mountain in the UK,9/24/1979 1:10
540,540, Yeah and no one still knows how it got there,4/13/1999 17:11
540,540," Yeah strange for sure. The instrument goes back to 1700 though, pretty old",3/26/1998 9:35
540,377, Nice. Do you shop online at all?,1/1/2009 17:12
541,541," Yes all the time, I like Amazon and you?",2/13/1996 5:29
541,541, Me too. Did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain?,8/15/1971 10:47
541,1563, Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,2/10/1977 3:38
541,1563, Yeah. And they named a building after their first customer,7/14/2003 13:55
541,1563, Yeah and he spent less than $30 ,4/25/1971 11:30
541,541, Yeah. Did you know their workers walk up to 15 miles a day?,7/8/2014 20:45
541,541, Yeah I guess they are super busy after all. Did you know they own IMDB,3/13/1982 18:38
541,1563, Yeah they seem to be everywhere now really,10/7/1999 18:30
541,541," Indeed, they have become a true giant",4/22/2001 3:41
541,1563, Hey there! Happy Friday! Are you a baseball fan at all?,10/3/1991 19:52
542,542," I watch a little, You?",2/25/1975 3:10
542,24, I love baseball. I'm a Yankee fan. Do you root for a team?,4/28/1983 2:15
542,24, I live near Oakland so its the A's for me,1/15/2012 21:03
542,542, Have you ever seen the movie Moneyball?,3/6/1997 22:19
542,24, I saw it a long time ago,6/30/1987 7:52
542,542, Ah I see. It was about Billie Bean managing the A's.,4/2/1978 2:24
542,24, Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season?,7/2/2014 10:50
542,542," I have no idea. I assume a ton. They lose a lot for home runs, foul balls, and then you just see them switch out balls occasionally.",10/8/2019 23:30
542,542," 160,000 i understand.",9/8/2001 23:07
542,24, Wow. Have you ever caught a ball at a game?,4/28/2003 7:26
543,543, No but we had someone who worked there that we know give us one haha.,12/30/1984 23:16
543,1128, I don't think I ever have. Do you remember people going nuts for Barry Bonds homerun balls?,5/1/1991 14:07
543,1128," Yeah, people dove into McCovey Cove to get them. Did you know SF radio stations threw shade at Kansas City?",10/29/1980 23:48
543,1128, Against the Royals? How come?,9/15/2002 19:11
543,1128, They banned the song royals by lorde lol,4/19/2006 7:34
543,1128, Haha really? Did they play in the World Series one year? That must be it.,11/24/2012 14:15
543,1128, Yes the world series has been contested 114 times,11/4/2018 19:29
543,543, That's crazy but to be far the World Series was even around when the Ottoman Empire still existed,6/15/2013 16:20
543,1128, Yeah just since 1903,3/8/1986 6:41
543,1128, Hey it was great chatting with you. Have a great weekend.,6/27/1990 19:22
544,1459, you too!,2/22/1985 6:23
544,1459, Hey! Do you like baseball?,2/14/2018 13:28
544,544, I do.  I love watching the Chicago Cubs in the NL.,2/24/1980 6:52
544,1459, It was so awesome to see them finally win the World Series in 2016.,6/9/1999 20:30
544,544, Yes that was so exciting!    Especially after a 108 year drought!,1/29/1983 9:36
544,544," Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing.",7/5/1994 17:36
544,1459, Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city,6/20/1974 18:53
544,1459, Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were cursed by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat?,9/30/1986 15:51
544,544, Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?  But 5 million people celebrated in the streets after they finally won!,9/24/2008 12:27
544,1459," I would have, too! For one of the oldest teams in the major league? What a day.",1/4/2020 20:04
545,19, Yes.  The Cubs and Atlanta are the two oldest teams - founded the same year as the battle of little bighourn!,11/3/1978 3:03
545,19, It's so weird to think that the Cubs is only one of the two baseball teams in Chicago.,11/4/1981 0:02
545,19," Yes that is pretty funny.  They have always been unique - they have had pitchers with 4, 5, and 6 fingers!",2/24/1984 16:06
545,19, That's pretty neat. Can you believe the Ottoman empire was still in existence when the Cubs first won the World Series?,5/5/2017 18:22
545,545, Wow that was a long time ago!   They have appeared in 11 world series total - apparently they were a lot better a hundred years ago!,1/21/1975 18:02
545,19," I love watching the World Series, though the Women's World Cup had higher ratings.",8/31/2007 1:52
545,545, Yes the World Series is great fun to watch.  The Fall Classic is always exciting.  I am not sure if I like it better with the playoffs than how it used to be with just the best record which went.,5/12/1976 8:31
545,19," Baseball is so popular in Japan, they are always surprised to hear it is America's National pasttime.",8/17/1982 2:52
545,545, Yes.  I think its funny the reason that baseball managers wear a uniform is that they are actually allowed to play!,12/17/2021 18:23
545,19," Wow! I wonder if the same is true for the Kickball managers, or soccer-baseball in Canada.",9/9/1991 6:32
546,1601, I never realized that there was a couple who scheduled all of the major league games every year - all the way up until 2005!,10/16/2009 17:18
546,1601," Wow, that's gotta be over 2400 games!",2/22/1979 5:38
546,546, I wish my parents had collected baseball cards.  One lucky guy found 3 million dollars worth of cards of his grandfathers!,9/6/1997 15:42
546,1601, That's so cool!,4/15/2011 5:07
546,1601," Hi, how are you?",5/10/1985 14:08
546,546, Good! Do you like baseball?,1/15/2002 3:55
546,546, I do like it. Do you?,10/12/2020 13:42
546,546," Yes there are interesting facts about baseball, like the number of balls used in a season: 160,000!!",9/10/1995 5:18
546,1601," Wow, that's a lot! The Nationals missed the playoffs last year too!",11/6/1982 23:34
546,1601," I looks it was a difficult season for them, they did score but against one of the teams in the bottom, the Marlins",10/19/1974 15:03
547,820, They had a really great lineup that really underpreformed. It was a shame they couldnt perform under their new manager.,2/23/2002 8:22
547,547," that is tough, they were basically depending on other teams to collapse, the braves and the Phillies",10/31/2009 13:05
547,820, The Braves over performed and the phillies did too. It would be tough to win that division with those two ahead of you.,3/28/1997 20:19
547,547," Talking about the world series, i found it funny that in 2014 a great song was banned by 2 san francisco radio stations, do you know why?",10/9/1977 23:12
547,547," I do not know, why?",10/29/1980 14:44
547,547," it was the series between SF giants and new orleans Royals, so they banned Royals by Lorde, i think that is a great song",6/4/2004 11:04
547,820, HA! That's funny. Like watching babe ruth trying to steal a bag...,3/5/1986 3:10
547,820, How is that? Tell me about it!,11/15/2017 0:12
547,547, Babe Ruth was a large man. He was not the fleetest of foot. He was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series!,4/8/1986 7:36
547,820," that is funny!! talking about babe ruth there was a pitcher, a female one banned when she struck out Babe ruth and Lou ghering.. kind of unfair! ",12/21/2017 2:15
548,1685, yeah! THat's sexism! Seems like something they would do in the 20s and 30s though...,6/16/1983 10:04
548,1685," That is true, i think she did something incredible. And about women I was surprised to learn that the world series had a lower rating compared to womens' world cup",9/15/2002 10:34
548,548, The braves and the cubs are the oldest two teams in MLB. That's crazy!,5/16/2010 7:25
548,548," that is true, founding members in 1876 with a different name",11/5/2014 12:14
548,548, Wow! Nice chatting with you!,6/18/2003 6:34
548,548," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",3/14/2007 9:51
548,1685, Pretty well and you? Do you watch baseball?,5/17/2013 23:12
548,1685, I have watched baseball from time to time. You?,4/27/1978 8:18
548,548, Yes me too sometimes. Do you know why managers wear uniforms during the game?,6/9/1999 10:57
548,1685, I think they can rush on the field at a moment's notice to play a position. Highly unlikely though.,7/14/1973 21:50
549,1785," Yeah, interesting and good for them just in case. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?",6/1/2015 9:25
549,1785, I dunno. Canadian kickball?,3/17/1977 13:58
549,549, It is actually called soccer-baseball,12/12/1990 0:57
549,1785, That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool.,3/3/1980 2:29
549,1785," That is for sure, he made a lot of money there. DO you know who used to do the schedule for the major baseball league games?",12/22/1984 21:10
549,549, I figured the schedule would be done by computer. Who does it?,6/25/1980 7:08
549,549, It was a couple who did it for 24 years straight,12/4/2017 15:38
549,549, Wow. That must have been a pretty sweet job. I wonder how much it paid. ,10/2/2021 14:19
549,1785, Yeah that is a sweet gig for sure. They scheduled 2430 games a year,12/4/1992 21:31
549,549," That is a lot of games, but maybe year to year it doesn't vary so much. Get it right once and the following years are straightforward.",11/19/2022 2:15
550,1998, True. In Japan baseball is so popular that they cannot believe it is a pastime in the US,8/4/2002 16:25
550,550, I think the Japanese are not aware of many things outside of their country. Until a Japanese person does something important outside of Japan.,8/18/2022 11:00
550,550, I guess. Did you know the CUbs were the first team to win back to back world series?,2/18/1990 21:45
550,1998, The Cubs! How ironic! They struggled for so long to get a Series!,10/2/2019 22:55
550,550," Yeah, and they have not won ever since",9/21/2003 16:13
550,1998," That is a curse if I've ever heard of one. Well, someone needs to hire a gypsy woman to lift the curse.",1/22/2022 1:39
550,550, I guess. Nice chat,7/23/2021 0:33
550,1998, hi how are you? do you like game of thrones?,12/1/1991 7:26
550,1998, I do like Game of Thrones!  Do you know any interesting facts about it?,5/25/2004 8:46
550,550, Um this is the final season? i think it starts next month. i cant wait.,7/29/2002 15:09
551,551," Me too.  I can't believe it's already been 7 seasons since it first premiered on HBO on April 17,2011.",3/9/2010 5:02
551,551," Yeah, the show has a tremendous following and could go on forever. but i think it is better to draw things to a close. especially because of the author.",9/11/2022 0:18
551,551, Yes.  Did you know that Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens?,5/7/1974 12:20
551,135, Harry Lloyd? who is that ? i have heard of Charles Dickens. he wrote oliver twist.,10/23/1992 23:20
551,551, Yes...Harry Lloyd plays Visery Targaryen on GOT.,3/27/1991 23:21
551,551," Oh, ok. i am bad with names. i usually remember the names of the pretty women. LOL",10/27/1998 21:11
551,135, LOL  Here's another one...Charlie Chapins granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr on Game of Thrones.,1/21/2008 6:32
551,551, Whoa. i guess famous people have famous descendants. I guess i am screwed here. LOL Who is your favorite GoT character?,11/2/1982 10:59
551,135, I would have to say Khal Drogo.  Arya is the fastest rising baby name given to girls in the US...most likely due to Game of Thrones.,12/1/2017 11:12
551,551," That guy is amazing. He played aquaman too. Arya is a good name. short, easy to spell. ",1/8/1971 5:13
552,1146, Yes!  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.  That makes sense.,4/1/1991 5:42
552,552, I bet it is the same as LOTR and New Zealand. the locals might get tired of tourists though.,8/2/2010 11:22
552,1146, Maybe.  I myself would love it. lol  There is a National Geogrpahic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions like GOT characters.  lol,8/11/2021 17:37
552,552," Hm. well, i guess that GoT is a cultural phenomenon. Game of Lions sounds a bit flat though",2/23/2022 22:37
552,1146, Yes!  Do you like horses at all?,12/30/1992 1:27
552,552," Yes, I do like horses, but I have never ridden one. they are majestic but expensive animals. Anyway, great chat!",9/17/2020 7:17
552,552, Did you know that Clint Eastwood had a mid life allergy to horses?  It was a good chat!,5/19/1977 1:13
552,1146, That is too bad for clint. he loves horses! Great chat! have a good night!,11/13/1982 8:20
552,552, Thanks!  Hope you have a good night too!,2/13/2012 22:16
552,552, Hey there! Do you lie Pixar films? I just finished watching Up.,9/14/1982 0:44
553,1873, Yeah I love Pixar films. Up is a good one. I think it's cool that Pixar studio has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities.,5/17/2001 19:52
553,553," Yeah for sure! I just heard about that room a few days ago. Speaking of Disney, do you like the movie Aladdin?",4/8/2008 1:02
553,1873, Yeah Aladdin is one of my favorites and I am looking forward to the remake. I really enjoyed Robin Williams in the original.,4/10/1994 10:46
553,553, Me too. I miss him making films. I guess he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. What a legend.,11/8/1973 18:52
553,553," Very much a legend. Rest in peace Robin. Celebrities make so much money. For example judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode.",7/2/2005 9:51
553,1873," That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think.",6/16/2003 22:24
553,553, Yeah I think we should put our priorities in different things not just celebrities. But some celebrities do good like that celebrity TV chef in Ethiopia who is trying to combat his countries hunger problem.,4/1/1991 4:29
553,553, That's super interesting. Its crazy to think how much celebrities and pop culture influences our lives. There's this show called Game of Thrones that everyone is talking about.,11/8/2016 20:52
553,1873, Oh yeah I love that show. I am so excited for the finale. There is even a National Geographic show that is like Game of Thrones except with lions.,1/26/1974 0:22
553,1873, I've never watched the show! What is it about?,5/1/2021 2:29
554,303, It is very complicated but it is set long ago on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos. It is all about attaining power essentially!,4/3/1993 20:36
554,554," That sounds like something I might want to watch in the future. I've been thinking about naming my future child Arya. Apparently, that's a character in the show! I guess it's the fastest rising baby name.",3/26/2020 8:11
554,554, Yeah that is a really cool name. That show has done a lot. Ireland actually pays the series so that the film scenes boost tourism for Ireland.,1/4/1989 18:33
554,303," Interesting. I've always wanted to see Ireland. I guess there are a lot of horses there, and I am interested in seeing them.",6/11/2003 15:16
554,554, Yes and it is also very green and beautiful. You would definitely like the Show Game of Thrones because there are a lot of horses in the show.,7/16/1987 20:33
554,554, I'll have to check it out sometime. Are you interested in horses as well?,9/1/2014 12:52
554,303, Yeah I have rode horses quite a bit. They are very unique and loving animals. However I never rode a horse to school like those two high school students who got suspended that one time.,4/4/1981 12:48
554,303," I have heard about that. Did you know that Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, even though he has been on horseback for many of his movies?",6/13/2003 11:03
554,303, That must've made work a bit harder! Have you ever ridden a horse with a fifth speed like the Icelandic horses have? It is called Tolt.,9/21/2009 5:08
554,303," I have not. I've ridden Lipizzaner horses, though. They're known for their classical dressage performances.",1/30/2009 14:46
555,1776, Very cool. Apparently they are born black or brown and take about six years to turn completely white. It was nice chatting with you see you later.,7/28/1995 14:54
555,555, I saw an article that says pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities ,12/26/1987 8:09
555,555," That's funny, considering the number of stars in their films, following in Robin Williams footsteps!",11/19/1990 14:09
555,1776, Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films,6/11/1988 14:26
555,555," Yes, I wonder if Judge Judy who makes $123000 per episode might do one!",3/14/2019 20:25
555,555, thats funny! I just saw that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the childrens series sesame street,11/18/2018 3:33
555,1776, That is quite a bit different than American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones!,7/16/1982 15:48
555,1776, ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who believes he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods,7/14/1998 0:24
555,1776," Perhaps he could join the cast of Game of Thrones, since they film in Croatia, Malta and all over the world!",2/2/1980 5:53
555,1776, I just saw that Charlie Chaplins granddaughter plays talisa maegry in game of thrones,1/8/1977 3:30
556,556," Interesting.     Harry Lloyd is also a famous descendant, the great-great-great grandson of charles dickens.",7/10/1974 23:17
556,556, some famous people.  did you know that there is a Nat Geo wild show called games of lions that follows the lives of lions like the game of thrones characters,4/5/2008 18:58
556,556, Wow.     I wonder if Ireland helps finance that like they do the actual show!,3/6/2010 23:05
556,556, Good question.  I saw that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most likely due to game of thrones,4/28/1989 2:12
556,556," People like celebrities, real and fictional - almost as much as horses or Equus Ferus!",3/30/1998 4:44
556,1368," Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, tolt, that is basically speedwalking for a horse",6/26/1976 1:17
556,1368, I wonder when that started in the 45 to 55 million evolution of the species!,6/16/1994 1:12
556,1368, not sure about that.  Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 bc ,2/12/2020 20:05
556,1368," Interesting, so the entire process of getting them used to humans took 1000 years or so.",12/10/1973 15:18
556,556, it says that domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC,3/4/2014 20:39
557,1438," Interesting, although there are still some wild horses in nature.",2/23/1980 17:21
557,1438, I read that Dalmations are associated with firefighters because they would calm and protect the horses.,4/9/1984 15:35
557,557, Wow!     I hope there are no fires in this area!      Nice to chat with you!,10/24/2006 5:07
557,557, do you know much about celebrities?,5/17/2012 11:56
557,1438, I know that Pixar has a room just for celebrities?,10/30/2008 2:14
557,1438, Yeah heard of that but it sounds a bit unfair though,10/28/1993 19:03
557,557, I agree. DId you know Robin Williams was the voice of Aladdin?,10/25/2003 14:56
557,557, Yes and that is how that trend of celebrities doing voice started,7/4/1992 18:38
557,1438, Yeah. Do you know who is the highest paid celebrity?,11/30/1994 8:10

566,408, Not sure of that but the team was named after a team in the SImpsons,5/23/1984 0:00
567,538, Haha that is awesome. In Canada it is called soccer-baseball,10/26/2006 15:49
567,538, Hmm interesting. DO you know how many balls are used during a MLB season?,2/1/2022 3:23
567,538, Hmm I have no idea but likely it is a lot as there are a lot of games played. How many?,5/27/2014 7:30
567,567," Well you are right it is a lot, about 160 000",4/2/1998 2:54

567,538, WOw that is a lot. Well the Cubs won back to back championships and then nothing for a while,5/10/2019 15:10
567,567, WOw I wonder what happened there. IN Japan the sport is so popular that they don't believe it is just a pastime in the US,6/10/2019 7:48
567,538, WOw nice. Do you know the song Royal by Lorde?,8/20/2013 9:06
568,1147," Yeah I do, is it somehow related to baseball or the games?",8/18/2011 9:36
568,1147, Yeah two radio stations banned it during a game between the Giants and ROyals,12/29/2013 12:04
568,568," Haha that makes so much sense, staying neutral",3/16/1978 19:03
568,1147, Did you know Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams? ,2/24/2006 8:23
568,568," i did not knwo that actually, has that ever needed to happen?",6/24/2019 18:44
568,1147," I'm not sure, but it would be interesting if it did. ",1/1/2009 4:41
568,568," that would be, do you collect baseball cards at all?",4/11/1970 10:29
568,1147," I used to, how about you? It was incredibly popular when I was younger. ",8/13/1995 2:29
568,568," I never did, but someone once found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic, what a come up!",11/10/1982 12:09
568,568, WOW! Did you know Bestbuy and Target will price match Amazon? ,6/23/1993 10:51
569,569," no i did not, but amazon is usually very competitive, so that is impressive!",10/25/2010 16:32
569,569," Yeah, it is. Target apparently doesn't carry tobacco products. ",2/21/2004 19:38
569,473," that is good, in my state no grocery store can sell alcohol",6/15/1982 1:59
569,569," Wow, not surprising. Maryland used to have a law like that. ",5/20/1996 9:18
569,569," I am around that area, so that makes a lot of sense. Vermont is the only state without a target believe it or not!",9/14/2000 10:37
569,473, Interesting. Why is that? I'm' curious. ,6/24/1988 7:57
569,569," i am not sure, it is interesting, you would expect it to be Alaska or another low population state",1/28/1987 12:08
569,473," Yeah, that is interesting. Did you know Kickball is also called Soccer Baseball in Canada? ",12/23/2018 19:56
569,569," no, but I suppose the name does make sense! I like baseball though, it is americas pastime!",8/16/2008 6:38
569,569," Yeah, it is a good sport. It is also really popular in Japan. ",4/14/1989 8:48
570,570, I heard they are usually surprised how popular it is in America too!,5/25/2000 13:16
570,119," Yeah, they don't know it is our national pastime. ",10/10/1974 18:45
570,119," I guess that surprises even me, football seems to be more popular from my anecdotal viewpoint",11/15/2010 8:02
570,119," Yeah, very true. The chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. Pretty amazing. ",7/19/1985 15:19
570,119, hey there what do you think of the game of baseball?,2/1/2017 2:06
570,119, Baseball is ok. I remember hearing my older relatives calling the World Series the Fall Classic. It sounds very retro.,3/31/2001 5:46
570,119," haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms",3/30/2016 21:21
570,119," Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think?",4/21/2010 5:57
570,119," haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea",1/24/1972 6:19
570,570," Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports.",12/9/1997 22:30
571,571," ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise",4/2/1981 1:34
571,571," As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too.",3/7/1998 6:11
571,1986," ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada",10/3/1988 9:30
571,571," Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though.",6/28/2001 20:21
571,571," haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha",11/23/2014 16:11
571,571, I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California.,7/22/1979 19:37
571,1986," wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw?",1/15/2020 13:18
571,1986," I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business. I hear more about Walmart being unfair...don't really ever hear that about Target but who knows, I guess...",7/14/1985 16:37
571,1986," ya I don't really know, I do go to target and apparently Vermont is the only state that doesn't have a Target in it",4/29/2014 5:28
571,571," That's very interesting. I wonder why Target isn't in Vermont, yet. Also, I wonder if Walmart is in Vermont, now? Maybe they have Bi Mart...although it's not very upscale for Vermont!",5/4/2012 9:14
572,572, haha that'd be funny to see! what is screwy is a state senator actually works at target in order to make enough money to get by,7/27/2006 21:36
572,572, I heard recently that eighty percent of the supplements sold in places like Target contain NONE of the advertised herbs in them. We really need a better rules system. ,7/11/1970 2:00
572,1146," wow ya I agree, that's really messed up, at least Target doesn't carry tobacco products that is good",12/11/2002 10:19
572,572, Very true! I wasn't aware until recently that Target was originally named Good fellow Dry Goods! Now THAT is retro! hahah,3/16/2009 9:50
572,572, haha definitely an improvement! pretty crazy that it has been around since 1902 and was founded in Minneapolis!,10/31/1999 14:13
572,1146, hi how are you? do you like to dance?,12/13/1970 21:30
572,1146, I like to watch dancing performances.  I do not dance.  I wish I could.,10/19/1988 14:30
572,572, I do not dance either. i am terrible. i might hurt people in the vicinity. i would hurt their feelings.,11/5/1981 21:29
572,572, Do you know who Bruce Lee was?,1/2/1975 17:57
572,572, I do! he was a great martial artist that wowed american audiences with his prowess.,2/15/1970 12:36
573,573, He was also a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,11/22/1995 15:15
573,573, I guess he had a tremendous sense of rhythm too. I would love to see footage of him dancing.,10/31/2010 16:02
573,573," It was before youtube.  Probably, you cannot find it online.",3/31/2004 20:01
573,573," Yeah, that is too bad. he was probably a real ladies man too. Tupac was also a great dancer.",10/26/2018 8:37
573,573, A ballet dancer!  He was the mouse king in his high school production of the Nutcracker.,8/17/1976 16:56
573,573, I would love to see video of that too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground too.,4/26/2002 8:47
573,1971," That was interesting.  If I were not self conscious, I might be able to dance just like what babies do when they hear music.",4/30/1975 22:33
573,573, I probably could not dance as a baby even. It feels like work to me. ,11/9/1990 7:34
573,573, I understand.  Do you know that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week?,10/7/2005 0:58
573,573," If i did it, it would be a dozen pairs. or forty. LOL i would probably bust the floor too ",6/26/1973 22:07
574,574," Talking about babies earlier, apparently, babies will dance spontaneously when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat.",10/29/1972 3:51
574,574," Yeah, i believe it. I wonder if i was like that. i think i wasnt. ",8/3/2021 19:16
574,20, Perhaps you can ask your parents. ,10/18/1978 23:42
574,20," I guess i could. Anyway, great chat!",8/11/1983 23:11
574,574, It was nice chatting with you too!,9/30/2008 13:29
574,20, Have a good weekend!,4/20/2003 21:55
574,574," Perhaps I will learn how to dance this weekend at the community center.  If babies can dance, I think I can too.  Good night and have a good weekend to you too.",2/19/1978 3:53
574,20," How's it going, have you seen the 2018 release of Black Panther?",3/25/1990 18:02
574,574, No I haven't but I understand there is some parallel being drawn between it and The Wiz,9/30/1985 17:00
574,574," I'm not to familiar with the Wiz, is that based on the Wizard of Oz?",8/9/1995 13:22
575,575," Yes, it has much different music (e.g., funk and disco).  The movie had Michael Jackson.  It doesn't have the song Be a Lion.",5/27/2021 4:42
575,575," I've heard the Wiz as being described as weird, from the description I tend to agree",9/30/1973 10:01
575,575, It is kind of weird... The music and the dancing are at the core.  You might remember the song Ease on Down the Road.,6/10/1977 15:01
575,575," Maybe but not that I think of it the normal Wizard of Oz is weird, like really weird so I guess the Wiz should be weird too",4/21/2017 3:03
575,1221," There is a big cultural difference between the two, like a farm in KS vs. Detroit.  Funny, it is at the Ford Theater in D.C.  ",10/30/2008 23:02
575,575," Ford Theater, isn't that were Lincoln was assassinated?",8/13/1976 0:43
575,1221, Yep.  I didn't realize it was still a theater.  I would have imagined it as a museum.  The tickets are $20-$73.,4/17/2020 3:06
575,1221," I guess $20-$73 for tickets isn't a bad price, if the Wiz is performed near me maybe I'll check it out",9/24/2010 6:59
575,1221, I may see the Black Panther.  I guess he is the richest of all superheros with $500B.  Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne aren't even close.,10/16/1995 17:23
575,1221," Nope, I hear Chadwick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa, he was great in Civil War",3/10/1973 18:12
576,576, I don't even remember it being a comic book.  I wonder if people confused it with the radical civil rights group under the same name?,10/31/1998 15:53
576,576, I used to think Black Panther was named after the group but I guess the comic came out before the group,1/6/1992 20:36
576,576, Interesting.  Now I'm wondering it the civil rights group got their name from the comic?  They changed the name to Black Leopard -- doesn't sound as cool.,3/26/1997 11:57
576,1243," Nope, black leopard sounds kinda lame",11/14/1989 23:42
576,1243, I didn't realize Siri was intended for Android until Apple bought it inn 2010.  ,8/28/1974 21:12
576,576," Me neither. I personally find Siri creepy, especially when it sings the same song as hal 9000",10/13/1985 3:25
576,576, Yikes!  Hal creeps me out.  It's like picturing Tupac as a ballet dancer.  I guess he did that in high school. I can't see that...,8/4/1995 1:26
576,576," Well I got to go, nice chatting with you",9/5/2003 8:17
576,576," Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics?",12/2/2015 5:40
576,576, No I never thought of that.  Were you a fan of Stephen Hawking?,12/23/2016 4:12
577,577, I think that it was amazing how he was almost completely paralyzed and could accomplish so much.,3/13/1987 15:35
577,86," Yes, I agree, he was brilliant as well.  He was the ultimate example of mind over matter. ",1/19/1983 7:06
577,86, He was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions  with a process named after him as Hawking radiation,10/26/1986 1:33
577,577, Yeah his understanding and explaining of quantum physics and other matter is incredible. ,12/21/1995 11:52
577,86," I don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me, but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world.",5/3/1993 22:10
577,86," Yeah I am the same, it is very complex stuff. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like species do here. ",1/6/2007 10:51
577,577, Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally.  I have to give credit as well to his supporters,10/10/2013 9:26
577,577, Yeah I agree with you there.  I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe! I'm sure Hawking would have disagreed. ,8/26/1990 18:00
577,577," Probably.  Also, there is a region of space maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  There must be so much out there.",9/15/2002 6:38
577,86," Wow, yeah it is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general. ",8/27/1978 20:29
578,578, Strange but there are some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand,5/18/2011 5:43
578,1081," That is a strange fact, very cool.  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics?",9/3/2010 0:03
578,578," Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics?",12/14/1976 4:09
578,1081, I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea. ,5/16/1973 4:24
578,578, Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters.,1/13/1999 3:10
578,1081, I didn't know that.  I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida's hair in brave right. ,6/10/2019 8:20
578,1081," People don't realize how much time is spent on these details.  Judge Judy makes a heap of money at $123,000 per episode  being highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James",4/18/2000 10:06
578,578, Holy cow that is so much an episode.  I wonder how much other tv people make. ,4/12/1972 16:27
578,578," I don't know, but I guess not as much.  Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street :)",3/6/2017 7:59
578,1081, Do you know who Stephen Hawking is? ,2/14/1981 18:54
579,579," Hello,  yes I do.  I actually just recently watched a movie about him as well.  The Theory Of Everything,  very well done and explained a lot about his life. ",9/5/2005 8:17
579,579," Interesting, I've seen that one too. Did you know a lot of his work is around blackholes? ",5/25/1994 6:45
579,1204, Yes.  Did you know that the deepest note in the universe is emitted by a black hole! ,2/4/2018 23:50
579,579, It wouldn't surprise me. I think a lot of his work was around the Event Horizon's if I remember correctly. ,1/5/1982 5:51
579,1204, If you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe!,12/21/1989 7:43
579,1204, Somehow I don't believe that. ,9/22/1987 11:36
579,579," Ok.  Thats cool.  I have no idea if thats true,  something I read recently in some cool facts.  This is no where near my area of expertise.  I did read that there may be a universe inside the black hole though,  isn't that crazy!",11/5/1971 14:12
579,579," Yeah, they have a lot of wacky ideas about the universe. That much I do know. They also propose it is a hologram. ",4/1/1994 16:05
579,1204, I also read that the universe used to be opaque due to there being too much plasma that light could not travel through it. ,10/1/2005 4:03
579,579," Yeah, I've read that as well. There are stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by humans. ",3/11/2015 21:35
580,580," Thats really cool.  I can't imagine touching a star.  Have you ever heard of a hubble telescope?  Apparently it discovered a galaxy so big it shouldn't exist,  according to physics. ",12/27/2020 18:02
580,5," Yeah, that is pretty cool. I know a lot about Hubble, it is a pretty cool telescope. ",7/9/1972 1:15
580,5, Sounds like it!  ,10/19/1984 22:31
580,580," Yeah, I remember when they did the space walk to fix it, remember that? ",6/4/2006 3:33
580,5, I do not.  Was that recently?,9/8/1996 0:08
580,5," It was about 15 years ago, apparently the hubble is having problems again. ",3/29/2009 23:15
580,5, I see.  Guess they really need to make some upgrades.  A lot in technology has changed in  years,10/18/2009 18:30
580,580," Yeah, it does. Pretty bad, the hubble can see a lot of things. ",8/26/2012 19:07
580,580, Did you know turbulence is one of physics great mysteries?,11/4/2009 18:06
580,580," I did, but they sort of have it figured out. I hate turbulence. Nice chatting with you!",12/29/2003 5:03
581,261," Hi, how are you?",6/25/1989 17:49
581,581," Good, how are you? Celebrities in science are quite rare aren't they? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking. I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS.",3/24/2008 7:57
581,261," He was tremendous thinker. Gosh, I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un, who has a degree in physics, supposedly. ",10/11/2001 22:34
581,581, I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind.,8/12/1984 1:50
581,261," In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted. I wonder whether he was one of the  scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection",8/7/2020 19:19
581,261," Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe.",9/12/1990 2:04
581,581, And he did all that while battling ALS. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. Does this make any sense? I wonder who came up with that.,1/19/1993 3:23
581,581," Hmm, it does not to me but I know I'm not much of a scientific mind. Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single atom before the big bang.",2/27/1996 14:50
581,581," Hard to imagine, but I guess the mathematics supports it. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics. Particles can pop in and out of existence, so I guess a universe worth could as well.",7/9/2015 19:45
581,581," Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable.",11/7/1977 16:09
582,1815, I think he took to his celebrity status quite well. Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities. I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it.,7/26/2008 20:59
582,1815," Speaking of celebrities, did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james?",1/2/1989 8:54
582,582, The woman is a legend. Over $100k per episode. Probably a longer career too. But she probably hasn't done any animated voice work.,7/5/1992 11:15
582,1815, I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history. Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. This was for the movie Aladdin.,9/9/1985 10:48
582,582, Did he ever appear on Sesame Street? Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series. He would have been great on that show!,8/11/1971 23:37
582,582, That is a good question! Do you like celebrity chefs?,11/11/1992 7:51
582,1815, Not especially. I think it's more about them than the food. You?,10/7/1981 22:29
582,1815," Yeah, not really. It's cool that a celebrity chef from Ethiopia is using his fame for good. He believes he can combat his country's hunger problems",6/30/1992 7:18
582,582," I think he'll have a positive impact. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you.",3/13/1986 22:41
582,1815," Yes, it has been fun. This talk of food has made me hungry though!",2/13/1991 20:35
583,583, Have a good day!,8/5/1987 8:51
583,583, How's it going? Did you know that the Universe could be just a giant holgram?,1/14/1974 9:28
583,583," Hi, Wow that is a hard concept to digest! Did you know it may be possible to touch a star?",11/15/1982 5:25
583,1804," No I had no idea, that would be awesome though as long as the star isn't too cold",7/22/1986 23:58
583,1804, They have confirmed there are cold stars and can be touch by our hands,3/20/1998 4:58
583,583, That's pretty cool. I wonder if it has anything to do with the region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe,9/5/1980 18:43
583,583," Wow the universe is so marvelous and complex, there are many theories, for example that there is only one electron in the universe!",7/17/2011 0:42
583,1804," That would be insane if there is only one electron in the universe, it would mean I wasted a lot of time in chemistry class",6/12/2013 2:33
583,583," That is a crazy theory! I totally agree. It is good there has been curious people like the Greeks, Copernicus, Newton.  Not always right but opened the way for research!",9/2/2003 4:03
583,583," Yea, it's interesting that the Universe may have evolved through natural selection like the species on earth",5/16/1971 20:48
584,584, All this has to do with Physics... did you know Pixar studied the physics of curly har for 3 years?,4/29/1982 21:08
584,584," No, that's pretty crazy, I wonder if they asked Kim Jong-un to help since he has a degree in physics",4/18/1972 13:45
584,1241, hahahaha It was for Maida's hair in Brave very different hair from Kim's... but maybe he helped with some knowledge ,7/27/1971 18:02
584,1241, Maybe Kim could explain how the universe was able to come from nothing without violating the rules of physics ,6/22/1988 22:59
584,584," hahaha that would not be easy! Talking about Pixar, did you ever hear about their secret room?",8/4/1997 23:03
584,584," Yea, I heard Pixar let's celebrities visit it",4/8/1974 4:37
584,584," I saw it in the extras of Toy Story, its cool! do you know about the highest paid celebrities?",1/10/2020 7:45
584,584," A little, I know Jude Judy is the highest paid before Lebron James",11/22/1992 4:00
584,1241, wow that is crazy!! how much does she make?,6/20/2020 18:16
584,584," Jude Judy is paid 123,000 an episode for her show",2/1/1971 17:22
585,1381, Wow that is a lot! Do you know Rbin williams was a pioneer in voicing characters for animation movies?,8/28/2008 7:12
585,1381," Yes in Aladdin. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you",9/9/1976 11:06
585,1381, Do you like to dance?,1/15/1980 23:39
585,1381," Hello, no I do not , do you?",8/10/1986 9:31
585,585, I do when I have a few drinks in me lol. I turned into a michael jackson type dancer,5/22/2004 0:31
585,1381," That's funny, I have never been much into it. I can do a few Fortnite dances because my kids force me to.",3/28/2010 22:01
585,1381," lol all kids know how to do that, they are hilarious! Michael Jackson has a patent from that lean he does",1/28/1973 20:56
585,585," I believe that, music is such a strong persuader.",7/12/1987 12:38
585,585," for sure, I love music. Babies do too. Did you kids as baby dance a lot?",8/17/1972 18:21
585,585," My son use to bob his head a lot to music when he was a baby, so I believe it!",4/16/1999 1:18
586,1392," I believe it too, I am watching my 10 month old right now shake her little behind to some music while standing up ha",3/22/2003 11:37
586,1392, Did you see the black panther movie?,5/4/1975 9:57
586,1392," Yep, it was a great movie. A lot of people watched it, I think it made a billion or more at the box office, did you?",6/30/2008 16:02
586,1392, I cant believe Disney now owns all of Marvel!,3/3/2008 12:49
586,1392," Right, talk about a great investment! Black Panther is the richest of all superheroes",12/3/2022 5:35
586,586, Really I would have thought Tony Stark would have been!,1/1/1988 6:05
586,586," Me too, or Batman! I think Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars!",1/26/2000 15:51
586,1392, That's crazy I wonder if he would use Siri? Im sure he uses a virtual assistant somewhere in that fortress of technology.,10/11/1986 0:47
586,1392," right lol. I have siri but never utilize that technology much, do you?",10/24/2021 22:51
586,1392, I use it only to make my grocery list! What voice do you use for yours?,8/30/2021 23:01
587,1898," That is a great idea, I just use the default one, the original I think. How about you?",7/31/1985 18:12
587,587," I recently switched from the Australian voice to the U.K version, gotta keep my women interesting fresh!",6/11/2012 23:26
587,587," I will have to check that out lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your weekend!",7/28/1974 5:50
587,587, Do you enjoy baseball?,12/3/1983 8:21
587,1898, Yes.  Just haven't followed it in the past few years.,7/15/2001 23:16
587,587," Me neither I just like to watch the World Series from time to time, its a sport with a lot of history. ",9/19/1982 4:05
587,587," Find it funny that the isotopes, a minor league, was named after a team on the simpsons",12/19/2005 18:42
587,587," That is funny, I used to love them in The Simpsons do you like the Yankees? that is one of the most popular teams. ",5/16/2002 0:20
587,587, I'm a Phillies person.  I like that the Yankees uniforms doesn't have the players names on their back.  Interesting concept.,10/3/1996 1:04
587,1898," It is an interesting concept, did you hear about the pitchers that swapped families permanently ?",1/11/1980 15:56
588,37, How can you swap families?  Didn't hear that.,5/7/2002 14:16
588,588," Yeah that happened back in 1973, and I dont know how that can work seems like both families are nuts",3/27/1970 23:56
588,588, LOL  Must be!  How about that 17 year old female striking out babe ruth and lou gehrig.  Wonder what ever happened to her?,3/10/2017 21:34
588,588," She did? woah, maybe she was hired to play in the league lol , Ruth and Gehrig must had felt terrible specially because of all the sexism of the time ",1/20/1976 13:18
588,588, For sure!!  I never knew a team receives 3 bases if an opposing team player catches a ball in their hat!!,1/26/2008 7:30
588,37," I didnt know about that rule, maybe it happens often, do you know the team Chicago Cubs? ",1/27/1972 20:21
588,37, Yes.  They're the team that only won the series twice and those wins were back to back.,2/19/1990 1:38
588,37," Yeah they havent won the series since then, I guess the team is cursed.",9/9/1976 19:21
588,588, Cursed for being greedy  lol!!  Your Yankees have the second highest attendance record!,9/22/2010 1:03
588,588, I guess that was the price they had to pay and really? the second one? I thought they were first,8/24/1978 21:44
589,981, I might have misread that.  2011 they were second highest.  Anyway  it was nice chatting with you!!,5/2/2014 6:31
589,981," Oh so that was back in 2011 that makes more sense, and it was great chatting I agree have a nice day bye",1/10/2008 7:45
589,589, Yes thank you,4/29/2008 17:59
589,981, Ok bye again lol ,8/23/1984 13:05
589,589," I am guessing long ball is really working for the Dodgers, what do you think?",10/9/1980 17:45
589,981," Yeah it really worked for them this season, just didn't have enough in the world series. ",8/17/2014 12:12
589,589, Who do you think will win out of the top ten? ,5/29/2007 20:15
589,589, For next season?  Well I think the Yankees will have a better season. ,9/11/1982 2:41
589,589," Yes, they seem good.  I also was happy to see the Brewers finally rising to the challenge.",7/27/2010 19:40
589,981," Hey now your talking, the Brewers are my favorite team.  I was upset when they lost game 7 to the dodgers. ",6/24/1995 21:44
590,819, I used to live in Wisconsin so still happy when they win.  LA team looks pretty good too.,5/7/2009 11:07
590,590," Nice! Yeah LA has been really good the last few seasons, I think they will have another good one next year. ",11/29/1972 1:17
590,590, Do you think next year will favor slugging hitters again?,5/25/1997 17:37
590,819," I think it will.  I think there will be even more home runs next year, how about you?",4/17/1995 1:51
590,590, I think so as well. ,12/3/1993 15:03
590,819, Did you watch much of the world series this year?,11/24/1990 22:13
590,819," No, I missed it, I work odd hours.",2/25/2017 22:01
590,819, Yeah after the Brewers lost I didn't have too much interest. ,7/7/1973 4:11
590,819," Wow, I just read that in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently, is that crazy or what?",5/24/2012 10:36
590,590," That is wild!  I know Babe Ruth was a famous Yankee, did you ever see the movie the pride of the yankees?",10/5/2016 23:34
591,591," I have not, to be honest I'm not a sports fan. ",7/22/2019 10:59
591,1735," I watched it recently it was pretty good, Babe Ruth played himself in the movie, a good Yankee movie. ",10/7/2008 14:46
591,591, That is interesting!  Did you see they suspended Don Mattingly because he refused to get a haircut?  I can't imagine that happening these days.,6/14/1994 10:24
591,591," Yeah, I remember the Simpsons doing a parody of that one time as well. ",6/14/2021 22:03
591,591, Now you're talking!  Love the Simpsons!,2/16/2012 8:53
591,1735," Oh yeah, the softball episode is my favorite of all time, Daryl Strawberry was in it, he was a former Yankee right?",2/6/2010 17:52
591,591, Do you remember which season? I'll have to catch that.,3/1/2007 2:53
591,591," I think it was season 3 or 4 maybe, but I think the best ever. ",12/11/1998 22:48
591,591, I love this time of year. Baseball opening day is just around the corner.  Are you a fan?,6/21/2022 1:28
591,1735," I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx.",4/13/2000 9:52
592,592, Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.  ,9/8/1970 20:12
592,592, Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series.,2/13/1970 20:45
592,420, I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009?,9/17/2019 0:23
592,420, I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance.,7/18/1985 4:49
592,420, Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too,2/19/1998 13:33
592,420, I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets.,2/25/1999 7:01
592,420, I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers,6/8/1996 14:10
592,592, I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual.,4/27/1976 22:56
592,420, Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.  ,8/27/1977 2:41
592,420, Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series.,6/20/2015 2:11
593,431, The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate. ,5/6/2001 20:23
593,431," I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016.",6/20/2015 0:14
593,593, I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing,8/6/1999 23:17
593,593, Baseball is all about tradition. That is probably why a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league games up until 2005.,8/27/1990 23:09
593,593, Can you imagine the planning and cost that would go into that?,1/17/1973 17:06
593,431, They were great at managing it. I never heard of any mistakes. Speaking of managers. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are techincally able to play.,6/19/1986 16:18
593,431, Interesting.  Also baseball is just as popular in Japan if not more so.,5/17/1984 13:14
593,593, That is interesting. It is so popular they are surprised to find it is actually America's national pastime.,11/23/2020 22:56
593,593, A lot of Japanese players have gone on to have great careers in the MLB.  Ichiro is one of the best hitters of all time.,3/24/1983 8:20
593,431, Do you like baseball?,3/21/2020 14:31
594,594, Sure. baseball is intersting. i try to watch the world series. you?,10/9/1986 18:45
594,418," Me too, interesting how the cubs were the first team to win them back to back and then had really bad luck some would say the team was cursed",2/22/2004 12:35
594,418, I think that they suffer a curse. what can they do to lift the curse? is there a spell to cast? A sacrifice to make?,4/19/1999 21:21
594,594," I dont know, thats an interesting question maybe sacrifice a goat and call it a day? do you like the Yankees?",3/9/1970 14:39
594,594, I am not a yankees fan. could we sacrifice another goat against the yankees?,4/16/1976 12:59
594,594," Sounds like a solid plan, you get the goat lol",6/8/1981 18:54
594,594, I figure that there must be something that can both lift the cubs curse and transport it to the yankees. Who has the most world series thus far?,7/5/2017 6:02
594,594," I have no idea, I would have to say the Yankees, ",6/27/1996 21:26
594,594," Yes, i think the Yankees have the most. Is this the result of voodoo and witchcraft? if so, then it can be undone through voodoo. ",1/3/1986 10:32
594,594," I have no idea about magic, maybe Bobby Richardson is also cursed, he is the only person to win the MVP award and the lose the series",8/8/2000 17:24
595,195, that is a shame. The new york yankees suspended don mattingly because he refused to get a haircut. Does that seem fair?,4/24/1992 23:46
595,595," No, it does not seem fair at all, there is also a Lost  Yankees player",12/13/1979 10:49
595,195, Lost? How did they lose him? that sounds almost intentional. What about bill oreilly? he has been pretty sneaky too.,5/1/2008 15:26
595,195," I have no idea, I think it means a player in the Lost series, and what about him? what did old Bill do this time",10/17/2008 12:49
595,595," Oh, he pretended to be a member of the press while he was in college in order to get season tickets. ",1/4/1994 21:43
595,195," Oh I heard about that, thats so funny, best part is that it worked, he fooled many and got to watch the games for free",11/5/1998 7:04
595,195," ol Bill is a cunning one. you gotta keep a close eye on him. maybe if he had worn a uniform, he could pretend to be a manager.",12/20/1977 12:22
595,195," He could just to get season tickets I know I would, he sure pulled a fast one on many",11/10/1989 15:17
595,195," I guess i was never tempted to get season tickets, but if I were, i would probably stray into the chicanery that bill committed. his sin is the sin that i would commit, were i in his shoes. Anyway, great chat!",5/5/1987 17:47
595,195," I guess we are different that way lol, I would follow Bills footsteps and get me free tickets and I agree its been a great and fun chat thank you very much, bye. ",4/13/1997 6:25
596,596," Hi, do you like baseball?",4/25/2013 7:32
596,1473, I do like baseball. dont get much chance to watch. usually watch the WS. you?,5/7/1995 14:14
596,596, I love baseball as well. Did you know managers can technically play which is the reason they wear uniforms?,6/8/1989 6:31
596,596," I bet that is from the old days. I bet in the old days, one of the players was chosen to be manager.",10/31/1975 8:26
596,596, Haha that would be funny to see. Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada.,10/16/1995 20:22
596,1473, What? Why? is kickball not clear enough? boy those canadians need to have a word for everything LOL,5/22/2021 11:41
596,596, LOL I agree. A man once found $3 million dollars worth in baseball cards.,8/12/2014 14:21
596,596," that is a terrific find. i would probably sell a few, but keep the rest as an investment. what about you?",11/18/1991 16:59
596,596," I agree, I would definitely sell the rest so I could retire early lol.",11/19/1994 21:16
596,1473," Yeah, that's true. buy stock and live off the dividends. did you watch the world series last year?",4/11/1970 14:44
597,1317, I didn't get to watch it. What about you?,3/15/2012 20:34
597,1317, I watched a few games. the dodgers lost again. they really have trouble in the series. ,11/2/2016 3:25
597,1317, I'm a huge Cincinnati Reds fan. Just hoping I can see a World Series one day. Who do you like?,4/30/2015 14:20
597,597, i like the bay area teams. they havent done very well recently. the giants were good a few years back. ,7/30/2020 5:12
597,597, That's cool. Did you know Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 in the 1926 World Series?,9/23/1994 19:50
597,1317," the babe didnt look like much of a runner. he could hit, but run? im surprised he tried to steal.",6/6/1999 21:57
597,1317, Haha I agree. The Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs won the World Series which is just crazy.,10/11/2011 6:44
597,1317, that is amazing. the cubs are in the history books. they are history. not much has happened to change their place in the history books,5/7/2011 17:54
597,1317, I agree. Do you like the Yankees?,9/25/1975 20:38
597,597, Not particularly. they always have a ton of money and can buy the best players. it is hard on the small market teams.,4/23/2007 11:35
598,1551," For sure. Well, it was good talking to you. Have a good day. ",5/9/2011 20:54
598,1551, Are you a fan of baseball?,6/6/2019 18:57
598,598, I will watch it if it is on but I don't follow many teams. Do you know a lot about it?,11/1/1986 7:55
598,598, Not a lot but a little. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically eligible to play if they need to?,3/13/1972 2:37
598,1551, I wouldn't have guessed that. I always thought of the managers as those out of shape guys who yelled at the players. ,12/13/1986 5:47
598,598, Me too. Did you know that baseball is hugely popular in Japan?,8/25/1979 11:03
598,1551, That I did know. They have some great teams over there. I think they were surprised at how popular it is in america as well. ,4/21/1988 21:09
598,1551, Yes they are which is so strange to me. Did you hear about the guy who found baseball cards in his grandfather's attic?,1/3/2010 5:02
598,598, Weren't they worth a few million dollars? Could you imagine finding something like that!?,8/21/1989 7:11
598,598, Yes they were. 3 million to be exact. That would be amazing!,2/24/1974 13:00
599,599, I wonder if there were a lot of Yankee cards in there. They seem to be the powerhouse team of baseball. ,11/4/2003 17:07
599,577," They do. Speaking of, in 1973 two Yankees pitchers swapped families permanently! ",11/10/1986 4:11
599,599, Um how would that even work? Like they married each others wives and raised the others kids? So strange!,7/21/2020 9:21
599,599, I guess. I have no idea why they would do that. Bill O'Reilly made up a fake press organization to get Yankee's season tickets while he was in college. ,3/20/1996 17:08
599,599, Given the price of yankee tickets that is one way to get in I guess. I wonder if that started his love of news as a career. ,12/27/1987 5:11
599,577, That's a good question but I also can't believe it worked. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won a World Series the Ottoman Empire still existed?!,1/26/2014 16:51
599,599, Makes sense. I might not know a ton about baseball but i know that the cubs  are always the underdogs. ,6/19/2014 19:11
599,599, Definitely. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then they never won again until the recent win. ,6/18/2009 5:43
599,599, You have to wonder why when teams like the yankees win all the time. Is it the money in the team or lack of players? very strange. ,2/5/2008 18:14
599,577, There is no salary cap in baseball and they have all of the money. They should cap it like the NFL does. ,11/18/1998 14:29
600,1611, That would be a good thing. I think it would increase the excitement of the game because you would have more evenly matched teams. ,12/2/2002 18:24
600,1611, I agree. They've been among the leaders in attendance since 2011 and you know that's because they always win. I think that would level that out as well. ,3/28/2001 7:51
600,600, Are you a fan of baseball? ,9/7/1991 2:00
600,600, I sometimes follow baseball. usually around the world series. you?,12/28/2019 5:19
600,600," Yeah, usually when my home team is doing good. ",5/18/1985 16:40
600,1611, i find the game to be too slow most of the time. I would prefer to watch the highlights and get the gist.,9/14/1993 6:52
600,1611," Yeah, they are better to attend in person. Or I should say they used to be better until they jacked the price of a beer up to $12. ",7/6/1986 0:29
600,1611," I do not buy anything at games. i get loaded up before and then partake after. during the game, no.",3/8/2021 3:43
600,600, That's probably a good idea. Did you know somebody found $3 mill of baseball cards in their attic? ,11/26/2012 19:22
600,1611," I would love to make such a find. i would sell some of the cards, and keep the rest as an investment.",10/18/1981 4:50
601,82," Yeah, me too. They must have been very old cards. ",8/23/1995 2:29
601,82, I think they were from before 1900. classics. very rare. collectors were probably pretty excited.,8/7/1999 23:14
601,601," WOW, I wonder if the Honus Wagner card is still the most valuable. ",8/25/2008 7:35
601,82," It probably is. i have no idea what its value is, but it has to be one of the most.",1/1/1971 14:53
601,601," Yeah, it is the most valuable card ever. ",8/30/2007 9:38
601,82, That is what i heard. i know that cards came with packs of cigarettes. that has changed! LOL,10/15/2001 23:32
601,601, Hilarious! I wonder what it is worth these days? ,1/10/2013 14:41
601,601, i have no idea. millions? you got me. some tech billionaire will want the thing and pay a ton.,8/29/1987 22:06
601,82," Yeah, that is probably true. Did you know kickball in canada is called soccer baseball? ",8/20/2015 4:24
601,82," That is a cutesy name. i wonder why they chose that. kickball is better, i think.",7/24/2010 12:19
602,602," Yeah, I'm not sure, but it seems hilarious. Well, nice chatting with you!",3/28/2017 22:54
602,602, I enjoyed chatting with you!,6/19/2020 9:04
602,856, Take it easy!,12/27/2007 1:45
602,602," Hello, are you a baseball fan?",9/4/2008 22:31
602,602," I do not know much about baseball but I have been to a bunch of games, including a few Yankee games. It does have the second highest attendance.",11/28/2016 12:41
602,602, Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings.,4/2/1987 18:30
602,856, I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises.,12/11/1977 11:21
602,856, Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one.,10/17/1999 20:36
602,602, I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer.,11/11/2006 4:33
602,602, Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated.,9/7/1989 11:01
603,603," You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition. A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.",7/24/1988 19:55
603,1313," Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today, now so many different companies make cards that there isn't a chance for them to be as rare.",6/12/2011 4:51
603,1313, I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable. I thought it was simply the popularity of the player. In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America's pastime. I wonder what their baseball cards go for.,3/24/2009 12:48
603,1313, It's interesting when a Japanese player wants to play in the MLB. The team gets money for that player leaving.,2/7/1988 22:12
603,603, I did not know that. In Canada kickball is called soccer-baseball. Odd how a different country views baseball.,7/30/1992 22:24
603,603, I wonder if they have any different rules than we do? It would be interesting to see if they put their own twist on the game.,3/18/2021 8:13
603,603," When I think of baseball, I think of countries like Japan and America. I don't really think of Canada and I especially do not think of the Ottoman Empire which were still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series.",11/20/2010 2:17
603,603," It's also very popular in Latin America. A lot of professional players are from Cuba, Puerto Rico, The Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.",6/19/1986 17:48
603,1313, That is true. I suppose Canada does have influence because in the 1992 world series the US Marine Corps color guard brought in the Canadian flag upside down.,7/13/1989 7:15
603,1313, That must have been embarrassing. Hopefully everyone realized it was a mistake!,7/23/1975 7:14
604,597, Well if Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run and everyone still loves him then I am sure it is okay about the flag all those years later.,12/30/1974 23:48
604,604, I'm sure it is since I've never heard it brought up until now.,2/15/1976 9:33
604,604, Well thanks so much for chatting to me about baseball. I learned a lot today.,11/24/1982 23:25
604,604," Thanks, it was fun chatting with you as well!",11/12/2020 21:29
604,597, Hello are you a fan of baseball,2/11/1989 15:34
604,597, Hello! I like the New York yankee's! how about you?,3/21/1992 21:58
604,597, Not really a fan of baseball personally ,6/23/1975 11:55
604,597, I don't follow it but I like Baseball! The world series is always exciting! The New York Yankees have a lost player....never found! How odd.,6/9/1982 14:58
604,604, That is odd... a man once found some 1900s baseball cards in his granfathers attic and they where worth 3 million bucks,12/21/1977 20:46
604,604," Wow, lucky! Did you know kickball is considered a type of baseball in Canada? Interesting! ",1/13/1988 6:18
605,605, That is interesting! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are suprised to know it is considered Americas national pastime,6/28/1977 20:12
605,605," That's funny, it has always been America's favorite pastime! I wonder if they take Baseball as serious as American's do lol, or if they watch the world series as well.",7/22/1976 5:02
605,1587, I have no clue... so you are a yankees fan,1/17/2000 20:40
605,1587," Yes, they are a very interesting team. Way back in 73 2 of the Yankees pitchers swapped families, permanently, pretty odd.",11/28/2017 11:01
605,605, That is odd.. Bobby Richardson is the only person to win a world series mvp despite losing the series.. I know the Yankees are pretty well known bbut not to much else about baseball,11/11/1995 7:27
605,605," Yeah, I don't know many Baseball teams. I do like the world series because it is pretty exciting to watch. Long ago, the women's world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series though.",12/28/1971 13:16
605,1587, That is pretty crazy.. my daughter plays softball so that is interesting to know... the chicago cubs where the first baseball team to win back to back world series and havent won since lol my step dad is a cubs fan,5/13/2007 3:23
605,1587," I love softball, I played on a league for a couple of years. So yep I can appreciate baseball because it is much tougher to play. The Cubs, I really don't follow them but I do love our home team too even if they are not so great lol..",8/31/2000 12:05
605,605, yeah i dont really pay attention to baseball this is the first year I have somewhat paid attention to football I went to a Cheifs game and it was a pretty awesome experience,9/18/1986 4:57
605,605," Cool! I haven't been to a Football game before, but have been to a baseball and a basketball and I think it was all pretty fun.",2/16/2007 14:50
606,594, Yeah it is exciting thats for sure,3/1/1982 15:11
606,606, It really was. Do you know what the Ottoman Empire is? I guess it was still in existence when the cubs last won the World series....not sure what that is though.....,11/10/2012 4:57
606,606, Im not sure what it is either but I guess that means it was long ago lol,4/8/1979 17:41
606,606," Haha, very true! I didn't know Baseball managers wore uniforms...in case they need to  play! Cool",3/24/1989 17:57
606,606, that is awesome all part of the team,11/30/1988 19:51
606,606," Exactly! Well, I will continue to follow a little baseball haha, and try and watch the World series as well. You have a great night! Great chat!",3/28/2020 12:10
606,594, Do you like baseball?,2/15/2022 18:04
606,594, I do - it was my favorite sport as a kid.  I even knew the married couple who scheduled all 2000+ games every year,10/19/2011 3:40
606,594," I didnt know about them, I guessed they had a talent for that, can you imagine the time that would take!",8/28/2021 9:18
606,606, Yes it was a lot of work.  I just wish my grandfather had saved baseball cards - one lucky man found 3 million dollars worth of them in his grandfather's attic,5/14/1990 20:12
607,1793," 3 million dolars no kidding! that is awesome, what a lucky break he had,",8/12/1997 2:54
607,1793, For sure.  Wonder if baseball cards exist in Japan?  The game is really popular there as well,7/4/2002 16:39
607,607," I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees",10/8/1977 1:28
607,607, I am an Atlanta Braves fan but I could not help but love the Cubs when they finally won the World Series a few years ago,3/2/1977 6:33
607,1793," Yeah I bet they were really exited, they could lift that curse finally",10/24/2012 13:16
607,1793, Yes they won back to back world series and then never won again for years,9/3/1988 14:47
607,1793, Babe Ruth was caught stealing a base and then his team lost back in the year 1926,11/29/1992 12:45
607,1793, Yeah talk about blowing the world series for your team - in game 7 even!,1/24/1981 4:31
607,1793," I know right, he still was considered a legend, things could have turn out differently if he didnt had the guts to steal that base",6/13/2014 16:33
607,607, Yes.  baseball is not as popular as it once was though - the womens world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series,5/16/2021 21:27
608,608," It did? Wow, that is suprising, womans sports usually dont get support at all",5/18/1998 22:09
608,608, yes as little as foreign sports!  During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down!,7/16/2006 17:42
608,1250," I wonder why, do you know the reason for that?",8/27/1992 20:02
608,1250, An accident I think!  They were clueless.  I hate the Yankees because they win so much.  Do you like them?,7/3/1986 16:37
608,608," I like them yeah lol, did you know theres a Lost Yankees player!!",8/6/1997 15:08
608,608, How did they lose him?  I knew that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently.  Not sure what was up with that!,10/10/1991 21:16
608,608," That is werid, I can undertand if it was a temporary thing but making it permanent, wow, I bet they hated their families",8/11/2000 19:33
608,1250," Hi! I recently learned that baseball managers are required to wear uniforms as well because they have to technically play should there be a need. So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right?",4/22/2019 19:48
608,608," that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ?",7/3/1973 5:32
608,1250," I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic!",6/30/2021 1:43
609,1805," I had heard about that, imagine being set for life overnight like that!",10/5/2000 0:32
609,609, How would you sell it? I imagine the buyers would be a small population.,6/29/2004 0:56
609,1805," I suppose so, do you think he took a loss in value trying to sell them for what he could get?",9/21/2008 10:01
609,1805, I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful.,5/2/2011 17:52
609,609, That really would be sad if someone exploited him,3/13/2017 0:55
609,1805, Do you have a favorite baseball team? Mine is the Yankees.,4/28/2005 7:08
609,609," I am not too into baseball, but who is the lost yankees player?",5/29/2019 14:43
609,1805, Yeah that's a little frightening and do they mean lost as in lost his way because of the fame or lost as in missing?,5/16/1977 15:38
609,609," I am not sure, I just know there is a lost one. I heard once they suspended mattingly because he would not get a haircut",3/25/1990 16:19
609,1805, The players to don a certain haircut? That's pretty strict! I wonder whether or not people still try to sneak into those games like what Bill O' Reilly did with the fake press pass. That's pretty smart since computers and photoshop didn't seem to be too popular back then.,3/10/2006 7:22
610,52," That is true, you can get away with a lot back then, now we know too much!",8/2/1979 1:13
610,610," Yeah, have you ever been to a live game?",10/1/2017 11:05
610,52," i have not, I know it is America's pastime though!",3/27/2005 11:34
610,610, I would argue that it was football! I didn't know there was a women's world cup has well and it even had higher television ratings than the world series!,1/24/1982 3:36
610,52," I would as well, but apparently it is very popular in japan as well!",11/6/2022 12:33
610,610," I wonder when they carried the flag upside down in the 1992 world series, whether or not that was the doing of Japan.",10/21/1992 14:17
610,52, Maybe it is because it was the canadian flag?,6/30/1999 23:15
610,610, Oh it was the Canadian flag! What was the Marine Corps doing carrying around the Canadian flag instead of the US flag?,7/8/1985 22:24
610,52," Maybe they carried both, I am not sure!",11/22/1976 10:59
610,610," I see, well it was great chatting with you! Have a good day!",8/31/2007 15:45
611,1013, hey there what do you know about baseball,4/13/1987 10:11
611,611," I know that it is a sport, played with a ball called a baseball. There are bases, and players, and bats. And hot dogs and popcorn.",8/8/2001 9:38
611,1013, haha hot dogs sound good! and yes the objective is to hit the ball and run around the bases to get to home plate,5/13/1974 2:15
611,1013," It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points, not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make.",9/2/1984 22:36
611,1013," thats a good question, but you could buy a lot fo baseballs if you found millions of dollars worth of cards in your attic like that one guy",5/8/1973 4:04
611,1013, He must have wondered why his grandfather didn't do anything with them. I would sell some and keep some. ,7/22/2007 10:36
611,611," ya kind of a bum move to sel all your grandpas cards, especially since theyve been there since 1940",2/9/2022 5:24
611,611, He might have needed the cash. Did you know that the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their cap? I've never heard that rule.,3/21/1999 19:50
611,611, wow didn't know that! also didn't know baseball is super popular in Japan,7/15/2018 3:34
611,611," Very popular, but not as good as the US version. Different experience in the stadium as well.",7/19/2010 15:00
612,82," I've heard that, funny the Japan are surprised that baseball is actually americas pasttime haha",4/4/1972 7:31
612,82, They have something called the Japan series. It doesn't draw the attention of the World Series.,12/18/2004 2:53
612,612," huh I'll look into it, can you believe until 2005 a husband and wife team scheduled all the MLB games?",2/16/1990 4:28
612,612, They must have had a computer to help them. All those games? It couldn't be done on paper.,11/10/1997 9:39
612,82," ya I agree, like 2500 games to schedule a year, that would get tedius!",1/6/2011 21:38
612,82," I wonder how much they got paid. The Cubs haven't had much luck, have they. They were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series; and haven't won since.",3/24/2004 0:42
612,612," no you're right, what do you think about the Yankees?",1/5/2003 9:22
612,82," They have too much money. In general, there is too much superstition  in baseball. Ben Affleck caused the production of Gone Girl to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a Yankees cap on screen.",3/25/1972 12:31
612,612, its funny they started out as the Highlanders but changed their name in 1913,10/19/1992 7:18
612,612, The Yankees is a very American name. Their logo comes from a medal designed for a police officer. ,2/2/2015 3:01
613,1297," oh thats cool, wild that they have the 2nd highest attendance in the league!",5/15/1988 8:55
613,1297, The Yankees are an institution. They've won the most World Series.,10/28/2000 23:35
613,1297," ya, and I don'w know but apparently the Yankees lost a player somehow, do you know about that?",2/24/1984 2:01
613,1297," How's it going, do you follow baseball much? The Dodgers beat the Braves 6-0 in game 1 of the national league division series",6/9/1986 19:07
613,1297, I follow a little. That is exciting for Dodger fans.,9/10/1996 14:40
613,613, Yea their starter Ryu had a great game pitching 7 innings without a run,11/10/2008 3:14
613,1297," I heard Maz Muncy had a three-run, second inning blast. ",3/8/2015 14:53
613,1297," Yea it's amazing how many home runs were hit last season, with the Yankess setting a record 267 in a season",9/2/1997 6:59
613,613, Home runs make the game more exciting!,1/24/2012 0:37
613,1297," Yep, 7 of the playoffs teams in the division round were in the top 10 for Home Runs last season",9/8/1977 22:45
614,614, That is amazing. I just learned that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises.,8/5/2016 1:14
614,614, Yea I remember Pete Rose played a few games while as a manager ,1/22/2014 10:19
614,614, I have never heard that before. I always thought it was funny to see the managers dressed up.,2/28/1995 10:41
614,614," I wonder if baseball managers in Japan ever play, apparently Japanese fans are surprised to find out baseball is considered America's pasttime",11/12/1980 15:08
614,614, I wonder why they are surprised by that?,6/5/2010 9:26
614,917," I guess Japan really loves baseball lol, I wonder if they have valuable cards like the one worth 3 million dollars found in a grandfather's attic",5/26/2008 1:43
614,917, I wonder if its newly popular or if its been there for awhile.,2/17/1990 18:44
614,614," I don't know, it's funny the ottoman empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs won the World Series",2/2/1977 7:03
614,917, I wish there was a date to reference. ,4/4/2011 14:09
614,614, I believe it was 1908 before the Baltimore Orioles moved to NY and were renamed the Yankees,1/8/1975 22:28
615,615, Wow! It is funny that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in canada! ,12/13/1990 1:07
615,615," Lol, it's pretty funny Bill O'Reilly invented a fake press organization to get free season tickets to the Yankees",8/25/1994 6:43
615,1410, I wonder where the lost yankee player is,2/24/2022 20:12
615,1410," Well I got to go, maybe I'll look for him",3/3/1974 23:14
615,1410," Hi, are you a baseball fan? My favorite team is the Yankees, they have been around since 1901",3/29/1970 21:21
615,1410," Yes, Phillies my team.  Yankees lost me a bet for a $1 with my grandma when I was very young so I gave up on them.  Did you know that Roberto Osuna hasn't pitched since May 6 serving a 75 game suspension",11/27/1983 23:26
615,1410," I knew he was suspended but not for that long,what team is he on now?",2/2/1992 15:34
615,1410, I believe the Astros,3/15/1986 21:34
615,615," Oh, I knew he was on the blue jays, that's a pretty high risk trade considering Osuna violated the domestic violence policy",10/3/1974 18:30
615,615, Yes.  Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to serve a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar,1/27/1977 14:16
616,1185," Yea, I remember that, although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees wouldn't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents",11/17/1979 7:51
616,1185, It seems risky.  But the Astros seemed to want a late-inning reliever badly enough to get Osuna ,3/11/1978 4:12
616,616," Yea, as former world series champions they started to get worried they only had a 4 game lead in their division",6/16/2018 8:44
616,616, Did you know that a married couple scheduled all the major league games for 24 years up until 2005,3/17/1973 4:00
616,1185, Now but that must of took them a lot of time,2/24/2020 18:16
616,1185, A man found $3 million  in baseball cards in his grandfather's attic,11/4/2008 11:22
616,1185, I'm surprised they were still in good condition after being hidden since the 1940s,1/29/1990 21:04
616,616," Yes, I wish I found them.  Interestingly speaking of baseball it says that in 1973 two yankee pitchers switched families permanently.  I wonder what that means?",12/19/2017 3:32
616,616," I'm not sure either, maybe they both divorced their wives and then married them",7/19/2012 9:36
616,616, In August 1991 Don Mattingly was actually suspended for not getting a haircut.  I wonder if they still enforce that rule?,9/11/1970 8:00
617,876," It's possible, I know they made Johnny Damon cut his hair and shave his beard when he signed with the yankees",10/27/1996 1:35
617,617," Wow.  Interestingly, the woman's world cup had higher TV ratings than the world series in the U.S. That is cool.",1/27/1972 17:53
617,876," That's cool, I think that was the year the US women won the world cup",6/20/1970 4:41
617,876, great!  The ottoman empire was still around when the Chicago Cubs last won the world series.,10/27/1984 23:26
617,617," Lol, I think they need to update that fact unless the ottoman empire made a resurgence a couple years ago",8/28/2007 7:16
617,617, So how bout them Yankees?,10/23/1977 4:51
617,876, How are they doing?,6/14/1984 10:51
617,876, They are perennially amoung the leaders in the MLB attendance and made the post season 2 years in a row,9/13/2001 10:51
617,876, Do you believe that Osuna has served a 75 game suspension due to domestic violence ,12/6/2000 5:40
617,617," That's crazy, I don't know what the Astro's were thinking taking the trade from the Blue Jays",1/31/1989 6:15
618,1794, I wonder why he's allowed back,7/9/1978 7:33
618,618, I guess it's his first offense and they are waiting to find out about his upcoming court hearing,12/13/2014 11:55
618,1794, oh.  the Astros think Osuna is remorseful and had enough counseling to not harm anyone in baseball I guess,6/21/2021 10:59
618,618, I guess they are giving him a fresh start which means as long as he plays good we don't care,11/29/2016 0:15
618,618, He says he won't let them down.,1/1/2019 2:58
618,1794," If they are serious of giving him a fresh start they should wait till next year, he hasn't pitched in the majors since May 6 anyway",7/11/1983 7:05
618,1794, The trade left the Astros in a sticky situation.  All that money invested and what return yet,1/13/1992 20:32
618,618," I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper, maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead",5/1/1977 7:28
618,618, They might need him,6/11/2020 6:36
618,618, He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though,6/16/1994 23:13
619,619, Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks,8/11/1984 6:13
619,1849," Yea, he's the face of the franchise now since Jeter left",4/15/1978 1:09
619,619, Did you know the Yankees had been the Highlanders?,10/5/2020 10:50
619,619," Yea I read about that a long time ago, I didn't remember them starting off as the Baltimore Orioles though",6/18/1978 12:02
619,1849," Yes, that is strange and I wouldn't have known that.",10/20/2017 3:41
619,619, I didn't know they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets in 1974 and 75 either,10/28/1997 16:06
619,619," Wow, interesting fact.  I never heard that one either",10/23/1973 16:51
619,619, What do you think about the Orioles and the signing of Alex Cobb?,7/11/1995 18:14
619,619," well I think theyre doing what they need to do but I don't know much about baseball, do you?",4/2/2000 7:08
619,1849," I know a bit, I tend to follow some of the games and I think that it was a good call, baseball is an interesting sport indeed, many cool facts about the game",11/14/1995 23:56
620,1858," oh ya for sure, like how the MLB uses 160k balls in a given year for all their games",1/8/1984 13:50
620,620," Thats a lot of balls, just like a single couple used to schedule all of the 2430 games of the league, seems like a lot of hard work",5/18/2009 2:35
620,1858," that does seem like a lot of work, did you hear that a 17 year old girl struck out Babe Ruth, I wonder what happened to her",9/24/1990 0:43
620,1858, Really? a 17 year old struck out one of the greatest players of the history of the game!!! thats crazy!!,11/10/1977 5:31
620,620," yup, she should have gone pro, do you know what happens if youre in the outfield and catch a ball with your hat in baseball?",9/14/1999 0:50
620,620," No, what happens if you do that?",7/7/1974 19:22
620,620," well you apparently get 3 bases, I never knew that",3/31/1984 14:53
620,1858," Really? I wonder why it doesnt happen often, I havent seen it, that would be interesting to see though. ",1/21/2010 14:26
620,620," nope I think they should do that more, do you like the Yankees?",1/5/1994 19:57
620,620," I think they are a great team, the team has a lot of history for sure, do you like them?",10/22/2002 10:51
621,621," I do actually, they win a lot and I like winning teams haha, I guess they were created in 1901",6/20/1982 12:20
621,1733," Its a winning team for sure lol, you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently, that seems really odd",4/5/1992 1:48
621,621," haha wow that is odd, pretty dumb how Ben Affleck refused to wear a Yankees hat because he was a red sox fan",7/21/2015 2:52
621,1733," It does seem dumb but I guess I can respect that, he must feel identified with his team, you know that a player got suspended because he refused to get a haircut!!",10/7/2017 5:59
621,621," wow that seems dumb! kind of weird that their uniform doesn't put names on the backs, they say it takes away the attention from the team",5/3/2008 10:18
621,621, Yeah so what do you think about the World Series? its been played for more than a hundred years a lot of history there,2/17/1972 6:29
621,621," ya I don't watch it but I'm glad its there, I guess its ya been going on since about 1903",4/24/2018 22:55
621,621," Yeah since the year 1903, its been a long time for sure, the Chicago Cubs were the first team to win it back to back,",5/3/1984 21:41
621,1733," yup and then they didn't win it for like 70 years or something, I guess the Dodgers have lost more world series than any other team which also stinks haha",6/20/2005 6:41
621,1733, Do you like baseball?,9/23/1980 0:54
622,1636, I do like baseball. I can't wait for the season to start. Do you like baseball?  Did you know that it evolved from a game in England?,3/16/2018 18:03
622,622," I do like the game, yeah, and no I didnt know that, I wonder why its not popular in England then",2/13/1995 22:29
622,1636, I don't know.  Baseball is a form of an old bat and ball game played there back in the mid-18th century.  It's weird that it's popular in the US and especially Japan and not there.,8/15/2006 7:24
622,622," It is odd, maybe as odd as the managers wearing uniforms in the field, ",12/31/1990 3:44
622,1636, I've always wondered why they do that.  I assume it's to show team membership but I don't really know.,2/18/1998 13:24
622,1636," Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing, if the need arises they can step into th field, did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his attic",4/1/1978 8:00
622,622," So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right?",12/18/1980 2:51
622,622," Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right!",1/30/2003 12:05
622,1636, Definitely!  Those cards had been hidden away since the 1940s!  I guess the people living there either never went in the attic or never looked around.,12/20/2020 17:42
622,1636, So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees? what are your thought on the team,2/19/1999 3:40
623,623," I like the Yankees.  There's some odd stuff with them though.  I mean, did you hear about the two pitchers that swapped families permanently back in 1973?",1/27/2020 1:20
623,623," I didnt, why would they do that lol, that is really odd I have to Google that",5/15/1997 7:58
623,623, It is really odd but I guess it was the 70s  so who knows.  I've even heard there is alost yankees player.  That is especially odd to me.,4/13/1976 17:30
623,623," What does that even mean, a ''lost'' Yankees player? can you elaborate more about it",10/9/1984 4:33
623,548," I really can't, sorry. I just heard that one thing, a lost player.  No one ever expanded on it to me.  ",2/20/1998 11:38
623,548," Oh I see, well nothing Google cant solve then,  you know  a player got suspended because he refused to take a haircut",9/24/1997 6:52
623,623, No I didn't!  What player?,3/10/1978 13:07
623,548," His name was Don Mattingly, crazy right, that happened back in the year 1991",4/23/1992 22:53
623,623," You know, I would have thought it would have been much longer ago than that.  I guess I just figured there were stricter rules on hair back in the day.",6/17/2021 18:13
623,548," I guess so, still sounds a bit stupid to suspend a player just because of that, I think he was a key player for the team so yeah. ",11/8/1988 11:46
624,261, Hi there!  Are you a baseball fan?,12/5/2009 2:03
624,261, Not really.  I find the sport difficult to watch and slow.  What about you?,8/12/1982 4:29
624,261, I like it.  I think because it just it's something that always makes me think of warm weather and summer time.  Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada?,8/25/1978 3:39
624,261, It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada.  That is funny.,3/8/2000 8:22
624,624, I wonder why they call it that.  I'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms...I guess they can play for their teams if needed.  Interesting.,11/12/1991 21:06
624,624, Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is?,6/12/1982 15:26
624,624, He is actually an umpire.  He has a bad reputation for blowing calls.,7/19/1970 0:57
624,624, That's what I heard.  And he tried to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him.  I think being an umpire must be difficult,4/8/1991 1:00
624,261, I wouldn't want to be one.  Especially the ref in the NFL who blew that call against the Saints and cost them a chance of going to the super bowl.  You'll have to google it if you don't know about it.,11/19/2014 22:59
624,261, I heard about that in the news.  Same thing with being a ref in a tennis match or a soccer match.  It's a tough job.  At least there is video playback.  But human error plays a roll always.,11/22/1993 14:51
625,625, It does.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan too?,3/17/1988 3:42
625,1580, Yes I did.  It is popular in South Korea too.,11/19/1973 11:03
625,625, There's been a few Koreans who have played in the MLB.  Shin Shoo Choo from the Rangers is from there.,10/16/2009 4:57
625,625," Oh okay, cool.  Do you like watching World Cup soccer?",11/16/1987 0:41
625,1580, I do.  I watch it when I can.,4/8/2022 16:33
625,1580," I heard that more people in the US watched Women's World Cup soccer than the World Series, which I find hard to believe.  The final games of the Women's World Cup are always very exciting though.",1/15/2016 17:04
625,625, I believe it!  Soccer is super popular compared to baseball.  Speaking of the world series...did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 series.  I wonder if he was playing for the Yankees then.,2/15/2003 4:08
625,625, Wow!  Well soccer is an easier game to watch than baseball.,3/7/1971 16:36
625,625, It is.  More action.  I wonder if they have hair length rules in soccer?  Don Mattingly of the Yankees once got suspended because he refused to get a haircut.  lol,6/17/2007 13:47
625,1580," I don't think so in soccer.  Many of the men have long hair.  Remember Alexi Lalas with the long hair?  Speaking of baseball, did you know a female pitched was once booted from MLB for striking out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig?",12/5/2004 16:13
626,1977, You're right!  A lot of them tie their hair back.  I didn't know that.  How interesting!  It's been fun chatting with you!,8/9/2020 19:05
626,1977, Same here! I didn't know there was a female pitcher to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.  Have a good evening!,11/23/1990 0:07
626,626, I'm going to have to look that up.  You have a good evening too!,9/20/2001 19:04
626,1977, Do you like baseball?,7/4/1975 0:17
626,1977, I love it. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms during games?,1/17/1977 13:44
626,1977, Yes they can play if their teams need them so they need to be ready,10/11/2012 23:50
626,626, Yes. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?,11/12/1984 2:34
626,1977, Yes it is called soccer-baseball,4/20/2001 11:43
626,1977, Yes I guess it makes sense that it has elements of both games,11/12/1986 6:09
626,626, Yeah. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule?,5/15/2000 13:04
627,211, Yes it was a couple that did it for a whole 24 years,10/15/1971 20:14
627,211, Yes and they scheduled 2430 games each year,3/5/1977 5:23
627,211, Yeah amazing. In Japan the sport seems to be really popular,5/5/1976 23:02
627,627, Yes so popular that they cannot believe it is a pastime here,12/22/2001 21:46
627,211," Yes, they must really be into it and appreciate the sport",1/13/2006 11:12
627,627, yeah. Do you watch the World Series?,4/3/1992 11:12
627,211, Yes I do. Do you know when it started?,7/19/1981 23:03
627,211, Yes it was back in 1903 so it is already over 100 years old,9/2/2006 17:02
627,627, Yeah. Did you know the ottoman empire was still around when it started?,11/20/1972 8:26
627,627, Yes that us pretyy cool. Did you know CUbs won the championship back to back two years?,8/22/2006 18:59
628,39, Yes and then they went dry for quite a while after that,12/15/1986 1:00
628,39, Yes The women's world cup has more viewers than the World Series though,9/16/1994 14:08
628,628, Pretty awesome. Nice chat!,5/28/2010 10:46
628,628, Same here and have a good one,12/13/2012 10:24
628,39, Do you like baseball?,10/7/1992 0:13
628,39, I love baseball.  Opening day is only 2 weeks away,10/17/2015 12:55
628,628," Only 2 weeks away wow I am really exited, I mostly watch the World Series though. ",5/14/1974 21:57
628,39, Well there have been some pretty memorable world series over the years.  It was first held in 1903,1/11/1993 13:17
628,39, Wow so more than a hundred years since the first game. Did you like Babe Ruth?,1/17/1997 23:00
628,39," I mean, I never saw him play live, but I do think he is one of the best ever.He helped make the Yankees a powerhouse ",3/15/2022 12:49
629,1655, Yeah event the bests make mistakes he cost his team the title back in 1926,3/21/2001 0:24
629,1655," Yes, Babe tried to steal second base and it did not work out well",8/14/2015 21:26
629,1655," No it didn't work well at all. The Cubs were the first team to win the WS back to back, I guess that didnt work for them either",5/6/1979 17:32
629,1655, And that was the last time they won until 2016.  Quite the long layoff,12/18/2005 16:21
629,629," Yeah, it seems like the team had a real curse on top of them, the Woman's World Cup had a higher rating that the World Series. ",12/7/1972 9:57
629,1655," Well the World Cup does just come around every four years, so I can see how it would be popular on TV",3/12/2003 3:41
629,1655, I guess that makes sense still World Series is really popular in the states and woman's soccer team arent as popular. ,2/5/2016 1:21
629,1655, Well baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day.  Too many things are competing for viewers time,10/20/1975 13:28
629,1655," I guess its not, there are a lot of sports out there, I do like the Yankees and the history the team has",3/24/2016 5:48
629,1655, They have the most wins in history by a large margin,8/10/1975 17:36
630,1234, Did you hear about Bill O'Reilly and how he invented a fake press organisation to get season tickets,12/23/1971 10:30
630,1234, He is a well known yankee fan.  I would not put it past him,7/5/2007 3:30
630,630, Maybe he found another way to get tickets by now and what about Don Mattingly interesting how he got suspended,5/16/1998 21:45
630,630, They have a strict dress and apperance code on the Yankees.  He should of gotten a haircut.,4/8/2020 13:57
630,630," Yeah I wouldnt fight against the team and just get one already, anyway its been great chatting with you today. ",6/7/2005 18:22
630,630, You too.  Have a good one.,4/17/1989 19:56
630,630, Good morning! How are you today? I am sure glad baseball season is back! Are you familiar with the game?,7/6/2004 22:55
630,630, I played when I was younger. ,2/18/1979 16:56
630,1234," I wish I played, but only neighborhood games. Do you follow any baseball now? I find it amusing that MLB team managers wear uniforms because they can play if needed.",11/27/2016 6:56
630,630," I follow the Nationals, what about you? ",3/16/2017 4:03
631,121, I follow the Chicago Cubs. Have you heard about the guy that found the hidden baseball cards?,5/25/2003 0:15
631,631," Yeah, apparently they were worth millions of dollars. ",10/8/1979 23:41
631,121," Yes! Hidden away in his grandfathers attic since the 1940's. I wonder if the grandfather forgot them, or hid them so someone would get a big surprise?",11/17/1976 5:15
631,631, I'm not sure. It has me thinking about the time my mom threw away my card collection. ,2/5/1986 17:01
631,631," Oh, hopefully no good ones. Isn't it funny that soccer-baseball is the name for kickball in Canada.",9/29/1972 6:10
631,121," Yeah, that is pretty funny. Is it a big sport up there? ",1/8/1982 13:29
631,121, I am no sure. I know in Japan baseball is super popular.,8/13/1970 1:34
631,631, I've known that for awhile. I'm surprised they don't know it is popular over here though. ,4/7/1982 23:21
631,121, I know! That shocks me too. ,6/6/1998 13:56
631,121, Are you a fan of the World Series? ,6/16/1982 11:59
632,1247," Yes, I am. As a Cubs fan it has been difficult. Prior to the 2016 win the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won.",9/27/1983 9:54
632,632, Interesting. Did you know the cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. ,4/3/2019 12:19
632,1247, Yes! Did you know Babe Ruth lost game 7 of the WS in 1926.,2/28/2015 8:12
632,632," Yeah, he got caught stealing. ",7/27/1985 6:16
632,1247," Yes, and they were already down by one run. I guess someone had to be that guy.",4/19/2009 16:45
632,1247," Yeah, that sucks. He was a great player too. Well, nice chatting with you!",2/26/1980 14:34
632,1247, Nice chatting with you too!,9/23/1994 9:27
632,632, Have a good day!,12/11/1977 14:37
632,632, Did you know the space shuttle's computer only runs on 1mb of ram? That's crazy!,5/30/2002 23:50
632,632," That is crazy! my computer has a lot more juice than that, unbelievable how tech advances.",10/17/1999 3:00
633,633, I know! I can't imagine not having computers now since we have learned to depend on them so much. ,8/27/1991 20:44
633,633," We sure do, I have an apple computer, I didnt know smoking near it would make my warranty void.",2/6/2002 15:06
633,1482, Really? I didn't know that. back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water....how strange is that.,8/22/2006 17:47
633,1482," Really strange, I wonder what happened to that model? maybe water wasnt the best choice. ",3/10/2020 9:09
633,1482," Right! I don't even know how that would work. Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's.",4/7/1978 7:19
633,1482, I know,5/18/1970 12:05
633,633, So do you like the piano? ,1/5/1984 11:58
633,633," I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it.",6/29/2020 4:21
633,633," Me too, I did play years ago but not anymore. I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome.",1/16/1973 2:26
633,1482, That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney,9/17/2016 1:13
634,634," My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship!",10/24/1981 12:05
634,505," That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though.",5/6/1983 21:03
634,505," Very true. Piano music is great no matter where you are. It is like poetry to your ears, which I love too. I write some poetry and it's a great stress reliever :)",7/26/2001 9:45
634,505," I do like poetry, do you like the series of Lord of the Rings? most of the hobbits names are actually names of poetry.",11/4/2005 22:31
634,634, Oh wow I didn't realize that. I think it's crazy that Edgar Allan Poe only got paid 9 bucks for his famous poem The Raven. Not enough people realize how amazing poetry is.,1/11/2002 19:45
634,505," That is crazy as its one of the most remembered poems of history, it must be worth millions now a days.",8/5/2006 10:05
634,634," I know! A very different time back then. So many types of poetry too, I love it and song lyrics most of the time are like a poem. Love it.",11/29/2019 9:16
634,505," Yeah, did you know about the poem Demetri Martin wrote?",10/1/1979 22:02
634,505, Is that the palindrome poem? Wasn't it like over 220 words? Amazing!,9/9/2010 11:43
634,505," yeah, it was over 220 words, pretty impressive and actually good.",1/20/1979 23:28
635,635, Hello! How are you today?,5/11/2005 14:18
635,1391, I'm doing well how about you?,6/1/2020 14:18
635,1391, Not too bad either! Do you play any instruments at all?,2/2/1992 11:55
635,1391, I do play the guitar. I heard that the piano is an acoustic instrument.,10/15/2018 22:03
635,635, Oh really? I never knew that! I guess the strings are struck by hammers huh?,5/8/1997 23:25
635,1391, I guess so. Do you know who invented the piano?,11/18/1997 17:06
635,1391, Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy?,10/27/2021 8:59
635,635, That is correct. The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings.,4/8/1971 8:54
635,635," That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about!",2/14/1987 10:02
635,635, I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming.,1/27/1975 0:47
636,636, Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did!,5/10/2019 9:31
636,278, Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this. Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm?,3/5/2011 20:13
636,636, No I don't! Who was it?,11/22/2006 22:04
636,636, It was by a woman named Ada Lovelace.,4/27/2001 17:18
636,278, Oh cool! I wonder if she wanted to upload her mind to a computer like other transhumanists want to!,8/5/2006 8:03
636,278, Wouldn't that be cool Ha!!! Do you know by any chance what was the number one installed piece of software on computers in 1995?,12/12/2010 13:22
636,636, Was it something like Solitaire?,4/11/2001 22:14
636,278, No. It was the video game Doom which I came across this fact very recently.,5/30/1973 1:06
636,278," Thanks for that fact! I remember that game, it was so cool haha. It was nice chatting with you though and just remember, smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty haha.",2/19/1980 7:19
636,636, I didn't know this. Thanks for sharing. It was very nice chatting with you. I hope you have a nice evening. Thanks and bye!!!,3/13/1981 9:45
637,142, Thanks you as well!,12/9/2009 23:46
637,142, Do you know anything about the dance program at Duke University?,2/6/2021 23:51
637,637," No, I don't really but they recently celebrated the opening of the new Rubenstein arts center.",9/22/1992 13:52
637,637, Who was Duke's first vice Provost for the arts?,10/23/1980 1:17
637,142, Scott Lindroth I believe. I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them.,10/12/1976 13:09
637,637," I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups.",6/6/1996 1:44
637,142," That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome. ",12/24/2020 11:01
637,142, I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano?,6/21/2019 1:49
637,637," I love the piano, but not sure how many programs are devoted to it. by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deeper learning experience though.",4/26/1983 18:55
637,142, I am a fan too.    Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700!,8/7/2022 13:09
638,638," Right! L played years ago, and I also love poetry. Everyone should have a creative side they let out. It is amazing that they found a piano at the top of britains highest mountain....crazy to think how it got up there lol",10/22/2008 21:47
638,638," It is funny that they test pianos with Circus Galop, a piece no human could play!",3/10/2006 2:07
638,709," Hahaha, that is odd! I love researching fun facts on the computer and you can find so much! I use my computer for everything, I write some poetry and save it to my computer.....you could probably find a program to teach you piano on the computer lol.",4/3/1991 12:12
638,638," Perhaps so.    It is funny that poetry goes back to prehistorical times, but we still can not teach a computer to compose it well!",10/3/2002 5:18
638,709," Exactly, there will always be a need for human emotion which nothing tech wise could ever do. The Edgar Allan Poe poem, the Raven was fantastic and he was only paid 9 bucks for it. Wow....",6/15/2001 20:33
638,709," Conversely, something as simple as the Japanese Alphabet, when recited in order is also a poem!",11/11/2017 22:42
638,638," I think I read about that while on my computer, and that is amazing actually. I will have to look it up I want to see what it is all about!",2/14/1981 13:16
638,709," Did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water!",10/12/1988 21:36
638,638," Really? That is awesome! something else to research on my computer, I love reading cool facts. Almost all of the Hobbit's character names were taken out of an old poem, how funny!",12/29/2007 12:43
638,638, Indeed!     I wonder if something similar inspired Demetri Martin's 224 word palmindrome poem.,5/22/2001 13:35
639,442," Exactly! I need to read that poem, must be very good. I am wanting to find that poem that is read normally is found to be depressing but reading it backwards is inspiring! Love that!",9/19/1979 10:11
639,639, I am looking for some of the poetry from the pyramid texts!,12/11/2006 22:18
639,639, Oh wow! Now that would be very interesting! I may do that myself as well haha!  It has been great chatting with you!,12/5/1975 16:59
639,639, You too.     I enjoyed sharing prosaic writing with you too!,7/29/1994 20:48
639,442," Hi, how are you?",10/9/1994 22:18
639,442, Good! Did you know Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies helped author a paper about AI? Not just a pretty face!,11/22/1979 19:49
639,442," Wow, I had no idea! That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd?",1/30/2019 3:52
639,639," I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes. ",11/17/1994 5:32
639,442, Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works.,8/26/1970 21:21
639,442, Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively. ,9/5/2005 15:30
640,640, That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it.,5/5/1990 18:36
640,640, Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix. ,9/23/2007 6:09
640,214, That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity...,2/19/2006 9:28
640,640," Haha. Definitely. Overthinking can be a torture, I'm sure. The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968. How far we've come!",6/8/1992 23:26
640,640, I would love to go on Lockheed Martin's virtual reality tour of mars. seems like it would be a lot of fun.,8/10/1991 8:55
640,214," It does sound fun. Up to 40% of VR users get motion sickness -- me included. So make sure to take your barf bag if you go, just in case. ",5/7/1983 10:54
640,214, I never thought of that impact on people. Have you ever gone on 4D rides at like disney? They move and shake but then they also spray water on you for when you go through water tunnels or something like that. Pretty fun.,8/19/2017 5:50
640,640," Yeah, I took my daughter on the Stitch ride and she FREAKED OUT! She thought it was real. I felt so bad. But that's proof that 4D can ramp up the experience. ",1/27/2022 16:19
640,640, HA! How old is she? My 7 year old went on a roller coaster for the first time and freak out until the end and then I could not get him off the rides.,10/27/1984 4:26
640,214, She was 11. But she has a really active imaginations and she loves Stitch -- so I think a part of her wanted it to be real. Wonder how she would do on that Lockheed Martin VR space bus you mentioned earlier?,4/1/1990 8:59
641,641, I am sure she would do great! Are you on Facebook?,4/2/1983 20:21
641,641," Yes, I'm on FB. Used to be on MySpace too, which offered to buy FB for $75 M in 2005. That would have been the buy of the century. ",5/27/1997 7:53
641,641, I know! Wht dopes! Like Iceland rewritting its constituion using ti.,11/18/1992 12:59
641,1089, There's a German state where it's illegal to use the like button on Facebook. Wonder what's that all about?,1/20/2021 17:43
641,641, Nice chatting with you!,10/9/1975 15:45
641,1089, Hello - did you know MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005?,7/25/2022 0:27
641,1089," Hi, Are you a registered user of Facebook?",2/7/1985 0:08
641,641," Yes I am, what about you?",8/22/2019 11:07
641,641, Yes. I am thinking of joining the QuitFacebook movement though,5/1/2014 13:08
641,641, I'm not a huge fan of Facebook. I rarely use it.,4/2/2017 19:58
642,930, Did you invest in the company at the IPO in 2012?,5/28/2022 11:24
642,930, I did not. What about you? ,6/16/2001 15:14
642,642," No, but it would be worth a lot of money today if you had.",1/30/2003 17:41
642,930, It would be a big investment. Did you know the Facebook like button is illegal in one of the German states? ,5/17/1981 2:32
642,642, No I did not. WHy is there not a dislike button,3/19/1987 4:11
642,930, lol not sure ,9/9/2001 9:59
642,642, They make most of their money off of ads,1/19/1991 9:19
642,930, Yea they make a lot off of ads. I saw that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerburg is red-green blind.,8/8/1993 17:49
642,930," Yeah, that is weird. I know how you can get a free whopper from BK",7/3/2002 7:29
642,930, How can you get a free whopper?,11/18/2010 16:19
643,688, If you unfriend 10 people on facebook,4/4/1973 8:48
643,643, That's pretty crazy and cool. ,2/20/1985 0:11
643,643, I am thinking about going back to MySPace and deleting Facebook,5/19/1977 7:06
643,643, I didn't even know MySpace was still around. I would like to do that as well.,12/24/2009 17:54
643,643, I want to read the Icelandic Constituion on there first,5/24/2018 5:44
643,643, I don't know much about that. ,5/17/2013 23:06
643,643, Time to check my posts on Facebook.,2/27/2017 12:17
643,688," When I previously thought of virtual reality I thought of gaming, but have you heard about its uses in the educational revolution?",10/20/2016 5:59
643,688," Hello there, same here, no I haven't seen too much about the educational side though. ",9/2/1992 4:12
643,688," Through virtual reality, children will be able to attend virtual schools and learn how they want. Through their tablets or visually.",5/18/1988 8:17
644,644," That is really cool, I guess they can get access to things and places that they never would have been able to before. ",11/2/2004 5:54
644,1475," Yes, for example if they want to learn visually they can use the headsets to travel to ancient Egypt and watch the pyramids get built!",12/21/2011 18:22
644,644," Wow, that is even cool for me and i'm an adult!  ",9/27/1971 6:04
644,644," It is.  It is becoming a lot more affordable too.  It used to be over $1000, but in two or three years should be less than $100.",10/17/1978 15:48
644,644," I think you are right, I think more schools will have these in the coming years as well. ",2/6/1990 2:14
644,1475," Yes, and can even use them at home to educate.  The program will allow the parents to keep tabs on their children to see how they are doing.",9/2/1984 9:44
644,1475, And I think all of those safety features for parents are a must with all technology these days!,4/11/2010 8:32
644,644," Yes, safety and affordability.  With a lot of companies like Google, Lenovo, Magic Leap, and Facebook involved you know there will be an affordable and great product.",10/13/2015 7:39
644,644, Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win win for those companies as well. ,8/5/2011 7:47
644,1475," Yes, agreed.  You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars!",2/18/2019 2:14
645,645," Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future?",7/15/1991 7:21
645,645, With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit.,12/3/1996 11:35
645,593, Exactly.  Do you use Facebook much?,9/8/2005 5:37
645,645, I do.  I cannot believe in 2005 that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million!,11/20/1978 18:59
645,593," Right! That would have been one of those deals of a lifetime, but mistakes happen. ",10/11/2002 23:46
645,645," It is impressive how huge it has become.  In fact, Iceland is literally rewriting their constitution using Facebook.  They allow the public to chime in with suggestions! Wild!",11/23/1974 0:41
645,593," Yeah I saw that, very interesting.  But, it makes sense though, let the people help control how the government operates, not the other way around. ",4/4/2013 18:29
645,645," Yes, basically the opposite of the German state Schleswig-Holstein where the like button is illegal. ",6/19/1984 8:49
645,645," That is hilarious, I wonder if you went back in time and told people 30 years ago about that, what they would say? Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day. ",7/23/1981 8:06
645,593, Hi!  Are you a facebook user?,12/18/2010 20:24
646,437," Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try?",5/7/1982 13:55
646,437, I think I would try it to see what it was like.,11/12/2002 19:32
646,646, I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun!,11/27/2013 15:12
646,646, I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then.,5/14/1984 16:15
646,646," I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret!",7/30/2006 1:39
646,646, Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality.,11/4/1976 21:58
646,437," Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers...",3/2/2000 10:17
646,437, I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality Mars bus that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat.,5/6/2006 10:57
646,646," Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!!",11/12/2007 1:47
646,437, Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released?,11/3/2021 2:04
647,1112," I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even!",10/8/1983 17:46
647,647, Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol,10/24/1977 13:54
647,647, Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI?,12/30/2020 0:22
647,1112, I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game 2048.  I haven't heard of that game.,6/8/2001 13:13
647,647," I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me!",3/24/1981 22:48
647,647, lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that.,6/2/2008 18:06
647,647," I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal?",9/11/1999 18:40
647,647, I wonder why?  I'm going to have to look that up.  I wonder what Myspace thinks of passing up on the chance to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005?  Is Myspace even still around?,2/23/1974 16:30
647,1112, I think MySpace is around but everyone uses Facebook instead. I think Facebook is worth hundreds of billions today. ,8/25/2015 4:08
647,1112, In 2012 when they had their IPO they were valued at $104 billion then.  So you are right. I'm sure it's more than that now.  It's been fun chatting with you!,10/26/2014 13:41
648,951, How's it going? Do you know much about VR? Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool,5/5/1976 21:00
648,951," Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach. ",6/4/1996 22:31
648,648, That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR,6/1/1973 2:42
648,951," Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners. ",1/19/1976 20:17
648,648, VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits,4/11/1982 3:13
648,951, Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI?,5/29/1975 2:17
648,648," Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well",2/3/2019 4:25
648,951," I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.  ",4/24/2012 20:39
648,648, Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time,5/1/1976 18:04
648,951, Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI?,4/10/2015 4:10
649,649," No, I had no clue. I don't know if I'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968",2/28/2015 17:23
649,678," Holy cow, I never would have guessed that about VR.  Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias?",5/25/2000 20:29
649,649," Yea, I've heard of that, very cool. Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also",3/21/2001 0:54
649,649," Wow, that would be pretty cool to try, I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that?",8/9/2019 10:45
649,649," I don't know, maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that is nearby a Lockheed Martin facility",11/8/1996 22:44
649,649," Yeah you are probably right.  On a different note, are you a user of Facebook?",2/15/1990 19:21
649,649," Yea, I think I started using it in 2006, two years after it was first founded by Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates",4/15/1972 15:12
649,649," Yeah I think I am the same, I'm pretty sure my roommate in college set one up for me in 2005. ",8/22/2012 21:52
649,678," I use to like myspace a lot better in high school, Tom must be kicking himself for not buying facebook in 2005",9/12/1981 19:14
649,678, Yeah think about how much money was lost not buying it way back then.  I think I set up a Myspace account but never used it. ,8/12/1970 12:05
650,650, Well FB is valued at 104 billion right now but it would probably be worth a lot less if myspace did buy it,6/15/2006 0:15
650,278," Yeah that is true, but I'm willing to bet it would be worth more than Myspace currently is. Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",9/17/1993 11:02
650,650, hello,7/13/2015 21:37
650,650, Hello how are you doing? Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005,1/29/1982 11:19
650,278, i bet whoever was in charge regrets the hell out of it,7/11/2003 0:17
650,278, Right!  Missed opportunity! Facebook's like button is illegal in the german state of schleswig-holstein.,7/21/1995 2:46
650,650, i wonder exactly what is so bad about it. The King of Pop started his solo career in 1971.,3/14/2002 1:26
650,278, Yeah i know right.  Why are they so against the thumbs up.  Freddie mercury cancelled a duet with michael jackson in the 1980s ,6/18/2011 5:07
650,650," Freddy's vocals would've destroyed jacksons. also - a llama, really dude?",7/27/2014 8:02
650,650, hahaha well MJ is really weird.  Maybe it gives him inspiration!  Michael jackson wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself to roam the nevada desert.,8/21/1993 18:33
651,651, only thing i have in common with the dude is being a massive simpsons fan. if i ran into that robot i would think i was tripping,11/3/2010 20:58
651,651, Did he have a music video of him being this large silver man or something? lol Thats awesome that Michael was a simpsons fan!  I need to start watching it again. ,9/13/2011 1:03
651,1648," you know, im not sure.....yeah! same here. havent really watched it much lately. taylor switf removed her music from spotify but kept it on pandora. think it was the money? ",2/8/1981 17:38
651,651, Maybe.  This is a ton of money Aloe blacc only received $12k in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams,4/19/2013 1:31
651,651, seems like someone got robbed. pandora makes 274 million in revenue,1/5/1977 9:12
651,1648," This is amazing,  I love listening to stand up Pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music.",9/18/2004 12:34
651,1648, woah -  i had no idea. pandora is powered by the music genome project. ever heard of it? i havent,5/22/2002 11:15
651,651, No I havent. ,5/29/1972 12:28
651,651, an effort to capture the essesne of music at the most fundamental level. i wonder what else they do. ,10/30/2021 1:56
651,651," yeah me too. On September 24, 2018, Sirius XM Holdings announced its intent to acquire Pandora for $3.5 billion.",6/5/2006 8:59
652,652, Burger king had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on facebook you get a free whopper. LOL i couldve had whoppers for daaaaayyyys,12/2/2022 3:05
652,652, haha what is the price of friendship???  whoppers!,6/26/1979 1:04
652,623," ahaha, we can be real life friends eating whoppers.",5/22/1990 8:43
652,623, right!!  nice talking to you.  have a good one. ,1/26/2021 0:46
652,623, Are you on Facebook by any chance?,8/28/2021 2:09
652,623," yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness ",12/17/2013 18:58
652,623, I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.  ,5/11/2007 15:56
652,623," I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others ",1/27/1982 4:47
652,652, I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements. ,11/7/1992 18:33
652,623, I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution,7/2/2007 5:05
653,653, That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard. ,1/4/1991 12:46
653,653," Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons",2/28/2014 10:59
653,653," I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio.",6/21/2022 0:51
653,653," Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though",8/10/2017 6:21
653,1819, He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge.,9/8/1990 10:32
653,653, I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3,10/24/2003 22:21
653,653, That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made. ,9/2/1976 22:10
653,653," I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora ",4/20/1989 22:57
653,1819, I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise. They have a net income of $-16 million despite having $274 million in revenue. I really think they need to look into their overhead cost.  ,9/26/1992 20:08
653,653, I would agree. I know she didnt like how they pay artist. I did not know they were streaming comedy also,9/20/1988 23:30
654,1297, I didn't either. I have never tried to use it for that. I use Podcast apps for that purpose. I'll have to look into that. ,7/13/2001 23:27
654,654, They have plenty of streams at 168 million steams for Aloe Blacc,10/15/1997 14:59
654,654, That's a huge amount of streams. I did not realize until recently that Pandora was only available in the United States. I find that surprising. ,10/11/2008 19:58
654,1297, me too I found the music genome project interesting to learn about also,9/8/1971 20:34
654,1297, Algorithms are always interesting to me. ,2/7/2012 7:22
654,654, I guess a disabled student who won a case against a TX school died recently.  Her name is Amber Tatro.,1/12/1972 23:15
654,1297," Yeah,  thats sad.  Do you used facebook?",2/9/1987 14:47
654,654," Yes, but I'm not addicted... It was a tough SC case.  I'm not sure I agree that schools should have to perform medical procedure.  They are school not a hospital. ",7/25/1990 9:20
654,654," Yes I agree,  unless they have medical training. ",5/7/1972 14:44
654,1297," It was all kinds of things with her... Infections, injections, etc... The school would need a team.  She got a standing ovation when she graduated. ",1/24/1997 4:21
655,371, Right.  That is pretty amazing. ,2/13/1996 21:31
655,371, Facebook... It seems to have many uses.  Iceland is using to rewrite their constitution.  What do you use it for?,11/23/1988 16:48
655,655," I use it for keeping in touch with people,  seeing what people are up to and news.  How about yourself?",6/30/2011 6:42
655,371, That's the same with me.  I comment very little.  I didn't realize Facebook is blue because Zuckerburg is red-green colorblind...,6/6/2001 16:22
655,371," Me either.  I just recently saw the movie the social network,  its about facebooks start. ",11/10/2000 18:36
655,655," Yeah, kids from Harvard -- wasn't it a student post board?  Myspace could have bought it for penny's...",12/28/1974 9:21
655,371," Yeah something like that.  I know right,  that was a huge mis opportunity on their part. ",11/13/1999 19:11
655,371, Yeah.  Why would Burger King have a promotion to encourage others to unfriend others?  They offered a free Whopper to unfriend 10 people.,7/10/1980 18:10
655,371," I dont know the reasoning behind it,  but I wouldnt mind a free whopper lol ",5/8/1970 23:12
655,371," Yeah, that made me a little hungry.  Did you like Michael Jackson?  ",7/7/1994 21:26
656,1267," Yes,  love the king of pop.  You?",6/17/2008 7:30
656,1267," yeah, he was a talent for sure.  I can't believe he wanted to develop a 50 foot robot to roam the desert around Vegas.",5/23/1981 7:12
656,1267, Hes always been a little different lol Did you hear freddie mercury cancelled a det with mj because he wanted a llama in the studio? lol ,11/2/1999 22:51
656,656, No.  I miss Freddie too...  strange reason to cancel... Do you listen to Pandora Radio?  The have comedian now.,4/21/1984 17:00
656,656," Yes,  love pandora,  I do listen to their comedy on road trips and long drives. ",7/7/1974 2:00
656,656," Yeah, ZM radio is cool too.  Thanks for the chat, you were great!",8/10/2001 17:30
656,1267, Good Morning! Do you like to travel?,1/27/1991 5:55
656,656," I do, I travel a lot for work, but even more for leisure. I wish I could use the commuter bus the Dutch are creating. It's designed to travel at 160mph!",10/16/2010 15:43
656,1267, I would rather do that than be in Iceland where there is no rail service!,12/27/1995 21:03
656,1267, I agree with that. I wonder how many people there have never left their towns?,4/2/1972 6:35
657,1741," I'm sure many are content where they are. I would hate to live in Japan though, it costs 300 dollars in tolls to drive across country.",11/1/1982 5:23
657,657, That would be an expensive road trip. I wonder how the first king to travel around the world got around?,7/17/1994 7:27
657,1741, I think it was King Kalakaua of Hawaii to do that and that was long before airplanes!,10/4/2016 20:15
657,657, I wonder if he went to Mackinac Island? They've banned motorized vehicles there for over a hundred years. I bet it's peaceful there!,6/15/2016 10:21
657,1741," I bet it is, instead of hearing the snow plows like I am right now! Did you know the dodo bird was part of the pigeon family?",7/3/2001 12:44
657,657," I did not know that, that's pretty interesting. I've heard that some birds fly from Alaska to Norther Mexico without sleeping! That is wild!",7/28/2017 21:16
657,657," I would be sleeping right away during that trip haha. Birds are smart, especially the ones that can mimic camera sounds in Australia!",10/11/1986 13:59
657,657," Yeah they are, and how hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.",3/27/2004 2:50
657,1741," I wouldn't know how they get the spider webs not to stick to them, I can never get them off me haha.",8/11/1989 4:31
657,1741," I'm not sure either, haha they always stick to me too!",9/5/2001 3:45
658,658, Have you heard of Machine Learning? it's the study of algorithms and mathematical models that computer systems use to improve performance.,8/4/2013 4:55
658,658," Yes, I actually studied it in college. I wish I could have wrote the algorithm that mines rap lyrics and writes its own!",10/11/1999 4:35
658,387, That would make writing songs much more easier! I like how they can make double entendres like that's what she said.,6/22/1990 1:35
658,658, That is pretty cool! Ubisoft actually partnered with the British Museum to apply machine learning to speed the deciphering of ancient hieroglyphics. ,7/8/2011 5:44
658,658, Technology is just beyond cool! They can even monitor food poisoning with it!,1/12/2005 12:27
658,387," It is amazing, possibilities are endless with it! Did you know the are you human  test on many sites serves a second purpose?",5/29/2018 7:49
658,658, I did not know that! All I know is that they are annoying when you have to wait for them to load lol.,5/5/1971 2:55
658,387, hi how are you? do you like animals?,8/24/2006 2:40
658,387, Hi there. I do like animals though I do not have pets. I think they should have rights so they are not hurt. There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents them in court.,12/7/1988 21:27
658,387, i do not have any pets either. i would like a dog. that lawyer must have an interesting set of clients. LOL,10/28/1994 4:53
659,1845, H&M was selling goat hair coats and there was video footage the improper treatment of the goats.,2/10/1985 4:41
659,1845," yeah, the source of clothing is often quite disgusting. people working under terrible conditions. child labor. its sad.",11/27/1995 21:56
659,1845, H&M is trying to trace the source of all its products now.,1/11/2012 9:44
659,659," that is good. it is easy to lose control of the supply chain. where do the materials come from? well, it is a big planet.",7/11/1996 12:03
659,659, At least it seems more and more businesses are recognizing that transparency is important. I think because more consumers expect it.,6/25/1974 2:57
659,659," yeah, we dont want to participate in a kind of oppression. we want clothes at a fair price.",8/30/1982 7:23
659,1845," Speaking of saving money, there was a man who wore 70 items of clothing so he didn't have to pay for baggage. I don't think that would fly in the US haha",9/2/2019 11:25
659,659, he must have been enormous. did he make it through the x ray machine? did he fit in the seat?,4/2/2003 15:43
659,1845," Right, haha. Bulletproof clothing often seems bulky as well. Bulletproof clothing mogul Miguel Cabarello shoots his employees to test the quality of his clothes.",6/30/1982 12:31
659,659, what?? that is crazy. his employees should shoot him a few times first. LOL,8/16/1980 0:07
660,660," Yeah, I know. I don't think he could pay me enough.",9/10/2020 22:37
660,209," yeah, really, there needs to be a danger pay, or a per bullet bonus or something ",4/25/2010 3:32
660,209, Yeah because we cannot live forever like the biologically immortal jellyfish and lobster.,9/16/1991 4:08
660,660, would you really want to live forever? i wonder if it would get boring or frustrating. it might be good to be frozen for a century then wake up for a bit. that would be fun.,2/7/2000 16:02
660,209," Not forever, maybe just longer, haha. In the Netherlands they try to help wildlife live longer by constructing bridges for them.",11/30/1978 0:06
660,660," that is thoughtful. the dutch seem to think a lot about nature. Anyway, great chat!",4/11/2021 4:02
660,660," Yeah, makes me want to take a nature hike right now. Nice talking!",9/2/2005 18:58
660,209, Have a great day! Bye!,12/8/2000 12:52
660,660, Have a good one!,11/27/1984 9:52
660,660, Hello ! Did you know the brand ZARA banned the use of animal after an investigation?,4/6/2003 22:07
661,661, Hello - I did not know that. ,4/22/1987 15:17
661,661," They were found to throw goats, I understand why people were shocked ",8/27/1991 16:46
661,661, That's crazy. Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color?,10/18/1993 15:01
661,1449," Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also ",2/10/2009 13:27
661,1449," Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage. ",6/7/1987 12:10
661,661, Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it ,3/26/2008 4:10
661,1449, Yea I don't think that's ethical either.,11/4/1990 19:49
661,1449, I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage,1/25/2011 23:49
661,1449, Yea I think so too. ,6/10/1995 16:15
661,661, Germany was the first country to give rights to animals do you agree with that? ,5/5/2007 16:56
662,560, Wow I didn't know that. I agree with that though. ,6/8/1981 7:50
662,662," I do too, but I mean it includes animals like the lochness monster... haha",8/27/2019 2:13
662,662, haha. Did you know rip curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says China? ,3/2/1973 19:59
662,560, Really ?? thats crazy ! isn't that so unethical also.... the people that make the clothes probably don't even get paid enough.... Apple did have a clothing line also but I mean it did not last,6/8/2013 8:51
662,560, Oh wow that's funny Apple had a clothing line.,3/20/1985 0:59
662,662, I bet it had apples all over it.... Did you know that many many companies are feeling the pressure to ban animal use such as faux fur? ,5/21/2009 23:56
662,560," I did not know that. I don't own anything with fur, but it doesn't bother me if people do wear it. ",8/16/1980 17:48
662,560, Why does it not? do you agree with the companies? ,4/8/1975 22:52
662,662," Animals were put on this Earth for humans to use by God so as long as you're eating the meat, it doesn't bother me to use the fur along with it. ",10/21/1995 1:47
662,662, Interesting point of view ! I still think they are right to ban it though ,12/26/1978 6:13
663,1300, do you like colorful clothing?,7/4/2012 6:00
663,1300," I do just like the pilgrims, do you know when they wear black?",5/18/1988 14:59
663,663, Yes only on special ocassions,6/7/1982 4:23
663,663, Yeah. Do you know how they can tell if you need your clothes tailored?,4/21/1990 20:35
663,663, Yes they look for collar gaps in them,7/17/2007 22:42
663,663, Yeah. Did you hear of that store in Alabama with stuff from airports?,1/10/2013 23:35
663,1300, Yes they sell stuff that are left unclaimed at airports from people,7/27/2016 23:50
663,663, Yeah I bet you they have all kinds of stuff there,1/28/2001 5:05
663,663, Yeah I guess. DO you like animals?,8/12/2018 8:25
663,663, I do. DO you know how many are there?,2/13/1978 17:27
664,664, Yes about 20 quintillion individuals ones,6/4/1989 15:58
664,1568, I do not even know how many zeroes are in that,2/10/2011 18:23
664,1568, Exactly. Do you have a pet?,2/19/2014 0:36
664,1568, I have a dog and two cats and you?,10/12/2006 5:03
664,1568, I have a cat. Domesticated animals have a white patch on the forehead it seems,4/22/1979 23:59
664,664, I do not think my pets have that though to be honest,9/6/1971 11:14
664,1568, Mine either. Do you know who we have hiccups?,10/26/2016 8:12
664,664, Yes they are left behind from when animals had gills and lungs,11/10/1992 6:15
664,664, Yeah. Did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?,12/5/2019 2:44
664,664, So cool. It was nice chatting with you,5/20/2013 19:26
665,665," Same here, nice chatting with you",2/9/2020 15:22
665,467, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! :),7/23/1984 15:16
665,467," Hello, what is your opinion on animal cruelty?",9/4/1985 11:31
665,665, I hate when animals are being cruel... ;),1/18/1990 22:01
665,467, Would you purchase a pair of shoes made of animal skin if they were on sale?,10/13/2014 16:36
665,467, hmmm... are Martens made out of leather ?,7/27/1991 1:53
665,665," I am not sure, but I am pretty sure.",9/26/1992 23:51
665,665, I wanna say no.... but if they look pretty cool... and the animal is dead already... I mean... I won't change the world by myself by skipping a beautiful pair of Martens...,9/14/1985 15:14
665,665," Animal are being killed for food, but I think there are other material can be used for clothes.",6/22/1979 3:17
665,467, I guess so... but I feel like that's going to end soon because I've read an article about artificial meat genetically made... so maybe animals will be safe soon....,10/5/1986 7:19
666,666," Yes, you are right. Did you know that some of the largest clothing chains discontinue selling mohair due to animal cruelty?",12/31/1986 13:22
666,97," I mean that's great, but I think they are just doing that for the media coverage... I don't know, don't know much about fashion...",4/21/1970 17:14
666,666, Maybe you are right. Mohair is made from the hair of a Angora goat for sweaters and coats.,7/23/2008 5:51
666,97," oh, so the animal is fine ? After cutting the hair ? Or does it suffer ?",9/28/1991 18:23
666,666," Oh, so the Angora sis much like a sheep?",4/19/1992 6:09
666,97," I'm not sure, I hope Angora is not suffering because somebody cuts it's hair...",6/23/1990 4:36
666,666, I hope not either. Materials that made from the hair of these animals are expensive.,5/9/1988 15:55
666,666, I'm sure they are... hey - Apple had a clothing line in 1986. I didn't know that....,8/24/2010 21:23
666,666," No, I didn't know that, all I know about apple is making and selling electronic products.",11/2/1973 15:23
666,666," Yeah, that's what I thought ! Maybe it's worth googling it after this HIT ;)",4/27/2000 2:31
667,390," Yes, did you know what type of clothing were made by Apple?",2/18/1997 3:27
667,390," That's the thing - I don't , but I would think it's something artificial - maybe worth looking into ; ",4/23/1991 7:16
667,667, What do you think about a man wore 70 items of clothing at a Chinese airport to avoid bagging charge?,6/5/2009 23:59
667,390, I think he had to be really skinny :),8/24/1980 3:00
667,390," You are so right, I am surprised he pass the checkpoint. ",9/10/1985 11:27
667,390, He was probably sweating like crazy ! lol :),3/1/2009 9:22
667,667," Back to animals, I am a animal lover and I hope things will change in their favorite.",7/26/2021 1:21
667,667," I really think it will soon. Hey, Thank You so much for chatting with me ! ;)",9/27/2019 11:54
667,390," Ok, nice chatting with you.",7/18/2002 13:47
667,390, My pleasure ;),12/15/2021 0:04
668,495, Do you like to travel?,6/24/2003 14:10
668,668," I love to travel. Haven't gotten much chance lately, though. How about you?",1/7/1990 18:46
668,495," I love to travel as well, so relaxing I want to visit Mackina island, sounds like a really peaceful place",12/11/1988 10:17
668,495, Where is that? I don't think I've ever heard of it.,5/24/2009 6:37
668,668," That is actually located in the US, I cant recall where but motorized vehicles have been banned there for more than a century",9/23/2018 0:19
668,495, Wow! Are they trying to keep a historical feel to the area?,6/22/1998 7:08
668,495," Seems that way, the air must be clean and free of many of the pollutants we have in the city, Japan also seems like a great destination, kind of expensive though",5/2/1978 9:59
668,668," Japan would be an amazing cultural experience, but travel inside the country is pricey, maybe even more than travel to the country!",7/26/2020 23:46
668,495, Yeah highway tolls cost more than $300 dollars thats too much money ,8/7/2022 22:29
668,668," I guess if you traveled there, it would be best to focus on one city so you don't have to spend on traveling around. It's probably expensive to travel in Iceland too. Most people there without cars take flights to get from city to city!",7/6/1970 17:40
669,669," That makes sense, seems like it would be just as expensive and the flight time is less, the firs king of Hawai sure traveled a lot",1/23/2016 14:46
669,1803, I wonder if he was surprised at the size of the world after ruling a small chain of islands for part of his life. I know I would be.,1/20/1978 21:43
669,669, Sounds like something to be excited about I bet he saw many kinds of birds in his travels,5/11/2007 18:21
669,1803," He probably saw some kinds that he had seen at home, since birds migrate so far. Some go from Alaska to northern Mexico!",6/8/1986 17:26
669,669," He probably saw a dodo bird, those are extinct now but maybe he had the chance to see one.",6/21/2014 21:47
669,1803," It's a shame they went extinct. The moa and the elephant bird have gone extinct too, but both of those were wingless birds.",8/1/1987 22:09
669,1803," There was an elephant bird? I bet it was massive, spiders must hate hummingbirds lol",1/10/1995 21:44
669,669, I'd hate hummingbirds too if they kept stealing my house to make a nest! Thankfully they're a bit too small and lightweight for that.,7/16/1999 7:47
669,1803," I bet hummingbirds wouldnt mess with bigger spiders, sounds like they are bullies but I hate spiders so I guess its ok lol",7/30/2015 10:26
669,1803," I'm with you - not a fan of spiders at all. Hummingbirds are beautiful to watch though, and penguins are my favorite animal. I'm on Team Bird over Team Spider.",5/31/2009 13:53
670,670," Im on Team Bird as well so that makes two of us lol, I bet a lot of people would agree with us.",12/23/1998 18:25
670,670, Do you like to travel? ,6/21/1974 22:32
670,96," Yes, I do. I dont often have the time or money to travel but i really do enjoy it.",11/5/2007 15:12
670,670, Me too. Did you know in Japan every highway is a toll? ,3/29/2014 19:34
670,670, the high speed highways impose a toll. the roads are not crowded though. you get what you pay for. did you want to go to Japan?,12/26/1975 9:28
670,96, I want to visit. Did you know that Iceland had no public rail service? ,6/22/2015 10:26
670,670," Yes, i did know that. Japan on the other hand has a tremendous rail service. if you plan to visit, the rail system is better than the highway. however the air travel in Iceland is probably cheaper.",5/8/1972 20:01
670,96, Did you know that bird's bones are hollow? ,6/30/2005 13:34
670,96," Yes, I did. they are stronger because they are hollow. lighter too. Did you know that birds have regional accents according to scientists?",12/5/1978 12:39
670,670," No, I didn't know that. I also didn't know the feathers weight more than their bones. ",1/7/2011 0:14
671,671," I guess that is also true of crows, which are among the most intelligent of birds, and are even capable of imitating human speech.",4/13/2002 7:04
671,671, Interesting. What do you know about machine learning? ,7/29/1988 16:06
671,332," It is learning done by machines. Beyond that, not much. You?",4/7/2000 19:43
671,332, They have an algo that can mine rap lyrics and write their own. ,1/16/1985 16:53
671,671, That is very cool. Soon we will not need rap artists. We can have the machines do it for us.,7/1/2002 6:16
671,671," Hilarious. Yeah, it will be like that Beastie Boys song Intergalatic. ",5/8/2000 1:59
671,332," Yes, that would be great. What else do you know that is interesting about machine learning?",6/11/1976 8:02
671,671, Apparently there are are you human  tests that aid in the design of machine learning. ,8/2/1984 14:39
671,671," Yeah, turing tests. this whole things we're doing right now is part of that study. Anyway, thanks for the phat chat!",8/2/2021 14:05
671,332," Right, that is what they are called. Nice chatting with you too. ",10/29/1982 6:14
672,521, Have a good evening!,11/9/1983 1:17
672,672," You too, nice chatting. ",9/24/2013 1:47
672,521, do you have a smart speaker? I have an alexa... but they kind of creep me out sometimes.,6/5/1977 10:38
672,672," I don't. They look handy, but come off as kind of invasive.",2/11/2003 0:37
672,521, yeah i think they can be... but it is useful. I like amazon products for the most part. it was way more affordable and versatile than the apple home speaker that was 350 ,4/29/2001 4:05
672,672," $350 really is too expensive. I get that Apple tries to go for the high-end market, but good grief.",5/28/1996 0:25
672,521, siri was intended for android and blackberry initially and it's funny now because the amazon ceo talks about how limited it's abilities are now.,9/1/1987 0:28
672,672," Siri isn't even compatible with Spotify on the Homepod. When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem!",12/21/2002 10:33
672,521, i have a huge problem getting alexa to connect too sometimes tho. it always tries to open spotty control... my husband and I always joke that we are an amazon family i didn't realize how true that was until I learned that amazon has owned IMDB since 98!,4/1/1970 1:15
672,521, Since '98? No kidding! I guess it makes sense for a company that started as a bookstore to branch out into movies next.,6/17/1994 1:23
673,673," yeah, i remember when they only sold books. a distant memory i think. now the workers walk 7-15 miles each shift.",12/12/1993 11:07
673,470, That makes me wonder how many miles the goats Google used to trim their grass traveled. Maybe 15 miles?,8/26/2007 0:45
673,470, hahaha google has some wild things. I used to live in the bay and their workspace is very unique.,9/25/1980 9:17
673,673, You've seen the Googleplex? Neat! What's it like?,6/18/1986 15:24
673,470, they have a lot of different campuses all over palo alto and san francisco. it is very well kempt. and there are google bikes EVERYWHERE.,4/24/1977 13:05
673,470, That sounds about what you'd expect from the provider of so much web traffic.,7/22/1979 3:44
673,470, yeah when they went down for a bit a few years ago web traffic dropped 40%. yahoo must have been happy for five minutes.,4/11/1987 20:36
673,470," Poor Yahoo. Apple has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana... I'm sad that Ask.com isn't still around. I want to have Jeeves as my personal assistant!",12/1/2008 14:15
673,673," that is a throwback. Cortana isn't very useful, but I like bing as a search engine...and i like that they pay you points that can be changed in for giftcards.",1/18/2020 13:12
673,673, Cortana was helpful in Halo at least. Can't really picture Siri hanging out with Master Chief.,5/23/1986 4:31
674,674, my friend met the siri lady in an airport once. that was interesting. ,11/20/1996 14:09
674,1182, Hah! I wonder how the male voice actors feel. Mr. Briggs didn't even know he WAS the voice until he heard himself in a commercial.,3/15/2003 23:29
674,674, yeah talk about being the weakest link. I wonder how that happens though...like don't they have to pay for his voice?,10/11/2020 11:25
674,1182," Maybe it was some kind of contract work, and the client wasn't disclosed.",5/13/1979 0:59
674,674," maybe that is a good point. thanks for chatting, I had a great time talking. :)",1/7/1997 13:10
674,674, Me too! Best of luck to you and your Amazon Family! Take care.,12/22/1995 14:54
674,674, DO you use siri at all?,9/27/2018 4:32
674,674, I sure do. Do you know what she sings if you ask her to?,1/30/1996 2:05
674,674, Yes she sings the same song as hal 9000 of space oddysey,5/5/2006 19:22
674,1182, Yes. Do you know where siri sends the questions that we ask?,5/11/1998 13:04
675,675," Yes to a database in North Carolina, pretty scary",7/8/1988 10:34
675,675, Yes that is why IBM are afraid of what siri might say,4/29/1993 9:20
675,431, And they are right to be afraid. DO you know who is the voice of Siri in the UK?,5/19/2005 5:31
675,675," It is a male, the same guy that did the voice in the Weakest Link",8/31/2008 7:14
675,675, Yes his name is Jon Briggs and he did not know he was the voice of siri,6/8/1998 23:45
675,675, Yeah until he heard an iPhone commercial. Do you use Google?,12/3/2022 0:36
675,431, All the time. Do you know how much computing power a search requires?,11/9/1995 3:57
675,431, Yes more than it took them to sent Armstrong and 11 others to the moon,9/6/2017 13:18
675,431, Yeah . Do you know how they calculate traffic?,5/5/2003 5:44
675,675, Yes they take the average of android devices in traffic,3/25/2018 8:01
676,1646, Yes. Google once hired goats to mow the lawn instead of people,2/16/1988 17:35
676,676, That is so cool and different and also more environmentally friendly. ,4/9/2006 15:09
676,1646, True. Did you know they went down for 5 minutes in 2013?,12/26/1984 16:19
676,1646, Yes and it took down 40% of web traffic down with it,6/21/2003 23:37
676,1646, That just speaks volumes  on how heavy its use it,3/3/1978 12:28
676,1646," I know, it is amazing. Nice chat",10/4/1970 17:06
676,676, Same here and have a good one,7/7/1970 19:40
676,676, Do you use siri in your house? ,4/15/2010 8:28
676,676," Hi! I use Siri sometimes by accident or sometimes when I am driving and can't take my eyes off the road. However, I do use Alexa around the house. Do you?",4/11/2019 23:31
676,1646," I've never used it, it is hilarious, because I have an iphone. I don't have alexa, I'm scared it will spy on me. ",8/9/1998 23:25
677,267," Oh, yeah, usually Siri is turned off for me like on my other Apple devices, but I have found that it sometimes comes in handy for phones when driving although most of the times it's quite frustrating because they don't understand me and do something else. Considering Siri's best skill is being a musicologist, I will have to try out that feature some time.",7/26/1988 2:23
677,677," It scares me, I was unaware that Apple had something called the Homepod. ",7/27/1978 7:20
677,677," Apple has restricted the scope of the HomePod's intelligence, considering that Siri gets things wrong about 10% of the time. It's nice that they built the technology so that everyone is treated the same, which raises privacy concerns because anyone can ask to read owner's messages.",8/25/2005 20:52
677,267," Yeah, do you use Cortana? The microsoft thing? ",2/5/2011 13:41
677,267," No, I don't use that, do you?",11/2/1986 5:27
677,267," No, but I find it to be very annoying. They took away the search functionality for that. ",7/27/2022 3:23
677,267," Oh, I'm not too familiar with that. What do you mainly use it for?",9/12/1993 21:26
677,677, I'm not sure to be hoenst. But did you know that siri was supposed to be for android originally? ,12/18/1974 13:18
677,677, That's surprising but I did know that Siri uses Bing search engine over google as its default search engine. ,5/12/1994 10:54
677,677," Interesting, I did not know that. ",6/2/2007 0:40
678,678, I would love to work at Google some day even if it means being called a 'noogler' and have to wear a propeller beanie cap because that's what new google employees are all succumbed to.,7/4/1972 15:39
678,1404, Well apparently the guy from the weakest link does the voice. ,8/12/1996 1:23
678,678, Which voice are you referring to?,7/8/2009 18:57
678,1404, The birtish voice on Siri.,7/18/2021 14:32
678,678," Oh ok, the American voice of Siri is a voice actor named Susan Bennett, she's also the terminal voice for Delta Airlines, I wonder whether she negotiated a licensing or royalty fee for her work.",11/1/1992 6:47
678,1404, I didn't know that. What type of roles has she been in? ,3/8/2011 16:00
678,678," From what I read, Delta Airlines, subway terminals, voice of Siri, etc. I'm guessing any commercial voice you hear in public places might be hers.",3/10/1984 22:42
678,678," OMG, that is awesome. I bet Amazon workers are tired after walking 7-15 miles each day. ",12/24/2001 18:09
678,1404," They are definitely tired, but on the bright side, they probably don't need gym memberships because they might be in great shape!",2/3/1987 6:54
678,678, That's true. The first customer spent $27.95,2/16/1993 11:19
679,611, Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia?,6/29/1973 0:43
679,611, Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place.,8/23/2020 20:16
679,611," I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect.",10/29/2004 13:31
679,611, It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission.,9/24/1972 5:29
679,679, It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.  ,6/8/1972 23:54
679,679," Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible.",9/3/2016 6:47
679,611, That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered.,1/16/1998 5:23
679,679, Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward.,1/6/1981 4:38
679,611," I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid.",2/14/1998 6:46
679,611," Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village.",12/4/1973 0:45
680,486, Or rather building a village close to where the animals already live.,6/2/1994 19:12
680,680, What about the Disney World alligator? Did you hear about that one?,3/21/2019 0:17
680,680," I vaguely remember something about that, what was the deal with it again?",2/20/1974 23:59
680,486, There was a sign that said stay away from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond. He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched. Poor kid.,3/21/2007 15:31
680,486," I remember that now.  I feel bad, it is just awareness. Some people have none",10/19/1987 1:47
680,486," Yeah, I heard that he was also playing in the water. And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others.",7/10/2006 8:49
680,486," Removal I can deal with, only if we were not intruding on their initial home.",6/5/2019 5:41
680,486, Yeah well I guess Disney World built where there were already alligators naturally. Seems pretty ineivitable in many areas of Florida that we would intrude. Sigh. I feel bad for the boy but the crocodile was probably just acting in its nature because it's a carnivore.,10/27/2010 17:54
680,680," Thinking like this little snack wandered into my home, how nice.  ",9/22/1979 10:18
680,486," Right.:/ And as humans we make handbags of alligators all the time. That being said,I'd be very protective of my children if an animal came to attack them.",6/13/1996 4:05
681,898, True.  Its been great chatting!  Have a nice day!,3/18/2006 1:16
681,898, Are you a fan of Disney movies?,2/3/2011 23:43
681,898," Hi, how are you? Yes, I do like Disney films. Loved them as a kid. I haven't seen one in a while though. What was the last Disney film that you saw?",7/13/2012 18:53
681,681," I saw Moana last, but also Frozen shortly before that, it was the first film directed by a woman by Disney, you?",7/8/2003 0:32
681,681," I think I saw an animated film, probably Fantasia? A long time ago. I have heard good things about Frozen.",6/17/1980 14:24
681,681," That was a while ago, an instant disney classic. Did you know toy companies get involved before they even make movies",6/9/2011 7:05
681,681, The marketing and the licensing are all together on this. The film seems to be a giant commercial for toys! LOL,8/25/1979 16:40
681,898," For sure, that is a good way to put it! Do you have a favorite animal?",11/18/1973 1:15
681,681, I guess dogs are my favorite. There are so many out there! Elephants are cool too.,11/22/1996 5:55
681,898, me too I love dogs so much. Elephants and dogs are the only animals that respond to pointing,11/6/1988 14:41
682,682, That makes sense. Elephants have a tremendous intellect. I think they are much smarter than we suspect.,9/30/1979 16:11
682,280, Did you know there are like 20 quintillion individual animals on this planet,9/13/1992 10:44
682,682, I figure we're killing them at a rate that is going to hurt our chances of survival. That is something we should worry about.,9/7/1973 18:56
682,682," For sure, it is sad to think that is happening. Hiccups formed i think because of animals ",5/7/2019 23:08
682,280," We probably do not need hiccups now, but there are there from a long time ago. Maybe when we breathed differently.",8/25/1988 13:06
682,682," That is very true. in 2002 animals were given actual rights in Germany, should happen everywhere",10/6/2007 21:27
682,682, Animals should have someone to advocate for them. Too often animals are left to fend for themselves. I wonder who the lawyers are.,2/22/1980 6:35
682,280," For sure, humans could do this if they weren't so busy doing other things.",4/1/2005 6:21
682,682," I wish that we had a longer term vision of our place on the planet. We don't. Humans are separate from animals, but not independent. We will follow their fate if we destroy the planet.",3/13/1984 8:37
682,280," For sure, I will be long gone by then but sad to think it will probably happen. good chatting with you!",10/20/1980 15:49
683,1499, Nice chatting with you too!,3/6/2016 1:11
683,683, Have a great weekend! BYE,3/4/1979 12:15
683,683, People in Indoenesia do not like crocodiles.  They killed 300 after 1 killed a villager.,6/6/2006 15:38
683,1499," I can see how the crocodiles can be dangerous though. For them, it's about human safety",1/9/1972 14:36
683,683," I understand, but the guy that was killed was in a protected croc sanctuary. It was kind of his fault.",7/13/2014 10:32
683,1499," And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal",7/3/2010 4:08
683,1499," Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers.",6/20/2010 14:18
683,1499," Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear",8/30/1999 14:27
683,683," Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies",4/11/1983 5:29
683,1499," On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany",4/1/1993 17:03
684,1616, That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty,12/7/1988 12:21
684,684," As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species",4/2/2008 13:48
684,684, That is funny.  Next it will be bigfoot,8/14/1971 14:55
684,684," If Bigfoot is in the US, that one may not happen. Although if he has a white patch on his forehead, it's a sign that he's domesticated",2/9/1981 5:44
684,1616, Apparently humans looked like bigfoot many years ago.  Then about 240 thousand years ago we lost body hair,1/7/1981 0:06
684,1616, One thing we didn't lose are hiccups. It's a leftover result of when land animals had both lungs and gills,8/14/2007 7:42
684,1616, That is insane to think how species evolved.  Now that are 20 quintillion different animals on earth,4/21/2004 10:47
684,1616," And yet among all those, we are the best distance runners due to persistence during hunting",11/30/1983 10:32
684,1616," Yes, but we have to buy our vitamin C.  Most other animals and plants produce it naturally",4/8/1976 18:17
684,1616," True, but I wonder how many other animals can regrow a rib in 2-3 months after it's surgically shortened",7/30/1993 0:03
685,685, That is true.  And we can use tools.  Let's see a crocodile do that,6/14/1979 13:13
685,1710, I wonder if there's a sound frequency that can cause fear in them like there's one that does in humans,7/22/1988 16:15
685,685, Maybe that is why we build fires and make weapons.  To guard against the fear,8/31/1991 3:58
685,685, Hi do you like animals?,4/27/1978 4:24
685,1710, Hi. I love animals. I have a couple of pets. How about you?,10/6/2021 19:14
685,1710," I also love animals,  I have a dog,  but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years",12/10/1993 9:50
685,685," I don't think he'll be able to find that. Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist.",8/22/1999 14:22
685,1710," well not the ones I want.  But they do exist,  the kimodo dragon. ",4/21/2002 0:58
685,1710, Oh that's right. I forgot those little guys are still around. Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights?,11/27/2002 19:12
685,685," Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those?",11/1/2022 1:53
686,725," Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have.",6/30/1981 7:28
686,725, I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?  ,5/6/2005 6:18
686,725," No, I had no idea. That is interesting. Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?",2/17/1991 7:31
686,725, Is that every animal?  I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish.  That is interesting. ,10/24/2003 5:51
686,686," Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats.",7/17/2012 12:17
686,725, lol what kind of animals do you have?,1/5/1986 17:39
686,686," I have two cats. They are rescues, really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen. Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman?",6/7/2010 13:47
686,686," Nice,  my dog is a rescue.  I wonder why they hate frozen,  it has such good songs.  No I didnt know that. ",10/14/1978 17:36
686,725, I don't know but they literally growl at the TV when its on. I guess they aren't Disney fans. I wonder if they would like the lion king.,9/26/1977 6:17
686,725," Yeah show them something they might relate to,  cats.  did you know that wreck it ralph developement started in the 1980s,  took so long to get that movie finish,  turned out great though. ",8/4/1987 8:31
687,687," I had no idea, that is a long time of development. I was also surprised to find out the lion king was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for its African release.",12/22/1986 23:21
687,140," Thats good,  they should make it dubbed in more languages. ",12/20/1989 14:32
687,140," Yeah, they are trying to sell to a big audience. I mean toy industries are involved with Disney animations before they begin making the films.",6/2/2013 14:29
687,140," That seems like a given,  these toys come out way before the movie to promote it and get kids excited about the movie.",10/13/1983 8:22
687,687," Well its no surprise. Disney is one of Hollywood's biggest film studios. If they make something, then you should get in while you can.",6/2/2018 12:33
687,687," Yeah,  its been good talking to you.  ",2/25/1975 8:17
687,687, Is Google your #1 search engine?,3/21/2004 12:01
687,687," Yeah, pretty much. I'm locked into a disturbing amount of their utilities. How about you?",7/23/2006 10:57
687,687," I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo",12/4/1981 16:28
687,687, I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google. ,12/15/2012 2:57
688,836," lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon!",12/10/1976 4:33
688,688," Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame.",4/11/1993 14:22
688,688," that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan?",12/31/1983 12:50
688,688," I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you?",9/24/1989 3:06
688,688," wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest.",10/17/1984 9:00
688,836," I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need.",1/14/1977 7:24
688,688," I have a friend like that also, no shame in that. That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still communicate with others if needed. Do you do a lot of amazon shopping?",4/6/1996 18:07
688,688," A fair amount, although they're another corporation I hate :) I get better deals on supplements and used books. How about you?",9/14/1976 3:52
688,688," For sure, it was started as a book company in 1994",8/29/2005 19:45
688,688," They're a good source of out-of-print stuff, for sure. Library Genesis is also good for obtaining unauthorized pdfs of a whole lot of books. I always check there before Amazon.",5/23/2011 5:49
689,689," I will have to check that out, is that legal to use? I am taking my masters and books cost too much",9/4/1992 22:55
689,689," The uploads are probably copyright violations, but I've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it. And any academic book you want there's a better than 90% chance you'll find it there. Just Google Library Genesis to find mirror sites. ",5/28/2012 4:57
689,689," wow, I will do that, thank you! Back to amazon though, jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000, i wonder why",11/9/2022 12:24
689,689," It sounds a lot like something called the Long Now Project that did something similar, IIRC.",7/24/1989 22:48
689,1072," I will have to look into that, that sounds interesting. I just googled library genesis. It was so nice chatting with you!",8/24/1982 22:04
689,1072, Likewise. But I don't think we're quite done yet.,10/28/2016 14:34
689,1072," Now we are, enjoy your weekend !",9/17/1984 7:10
689,689, You too!,8/31/1973 19:45
689,1072, It looks like Apple is have some problems with its new HomePod product. Do you have one?,7/24/2010 17:14
689,1072, No I don't have one. But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices. do you have one by the way?,9/14/1980 23:07
690,846, Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer products that are just as good at a lower price.  Kids and young adults buy them because they are cute and popular in their little clicks.,8/3/2020 9:55
690,846," Yep I think so. It's crazy that there have been over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though, so they are definitely going to get more popular over time",4/10/1990 15:27
690,846, I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object. Siri wasn't even and Apple development.  It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it. ,5/18/2007 18:00
690,690," Haha that's really weird. I also think it's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod, when you can get a Google home for about $100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred, that's definitely a rip off",10/29/1978 15:45
690,846," Yeah, that's Apple.  They have become more competitive but, face it, like everyone else their stuff is made somewhere in Asia. SO do you use something like Siri or Cortana?",1/26/1996 12:38
690,846," No I just stick to Google myself, I don't know what Google's voice assistant is called but it's not Siri or Cortana, what about you? What do you use",10/25/1985 2:58
690,690, On my phone it's Google like you.  On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.   I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?  ,1/25/2022 19:42
690,846, No I didn't know that either. I only heard the female Siri haha. What do you think about the fact that a Google search uses more computing power than the power it took to send an astronaut to the Moon,12/12/2004 6:56
690,690, People back then were good with a slide rule!  I think smart people will always be needed and computers will not take over the world.,5/22/1988 20:26
690,846, Yes I think so. What it is crazy how far technology has come. For instance Google can use Android devices on the roads to map traffic data,3/18/2019 4:20
691,691, Yeah.  I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013.  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  I probably thought it was a problem on my end.,10/28/1997 0:26
691,784," Wow that's a crazy amount of traffic! And no I don't remember that either, what do you think about the fact that Google Maps changes its Maps based on where you are searching from? That way if there is a dispute on a countries border it will create the border based on the user's location data?",8/27/1991 13:26
691,784, That is interesting... They sure go to a lot of trouble.  Like when they used goats as lawn mowers.  They clearly didn't know how ornery goats are. ,6/26/1992 23:31
691,784," Haha that sounds like that would have taken a long time, what do you think about the fact that the CEO of Amazon actually built a clock into a mountain? I don't know why he would do that do you",4/21/1972 3:47
691,691," Yeah, Bezos will do that in lieu of compensating his employees.  He's another one of the lefty liberals that would disappear if you removed the hypocrisy from them.  ",7/17/1990 1:33
691,691," LOL I like the way you think. it is crazy though that Amazon owns imdb.com, I use that almost everyday for my movie collection",12/11/1995 14:51
691,691, I love IMDB and was surprised to learn that.  I also learned that the 1st Amazon customer got a building named after him.,10/28/2000 11:46
691,691," Yeah that is shocking. And since I don't have an iPhone I wouldn't know this, but apparently if you ask Siri to sing a song then she will sing the song that HAL 9000 sings in 2001 A Space Odyssey which is definitely creepy haha",3/2/1974 7:23
691,784, That would be a little creepy.  Kubrick did the Hal 9000 thing where it was kind of chilling...  Thanks for the excellent chat!,3/19/2012 21:47
691,784, hi how are you? do you use amazon?,1/11/2003 2:31
692,692," Hello I am doing great! I do, a little more than I want to though, how about you?",11/6/2022 13:52
692,1147," I sometimes use it, when i dont have time to shop. i like to check things out in the store, if possible.",2/19/2014 22:22
692,692, It's sad but I have turned into the complete opposite! I only go to the store if it's not on amazon haha. I wish I was the first customer to buy something though!,12/23/1990 12:30
692,692, I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me. ,10/18/1977 16:15
692,1147, Haha I would like that as well haha. Can you believe how many miles a day an Amazon worker walks a day?,11/29/1995 14:22
692,1147," I think that they must lose a lot of weight, or get really bad knees LOL",7/21/2020 8:17
692,692, I bet! I didn't even know IMDB was owned by Amazon too. They have the hand in every cookie jar haha.,8/21/2012 6:07
692,1147," Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL",7/8/1976 12:53
692,1147, I'm only 30 and am dreading that just thinking about it lol. Maybe Google will try and stop them?,3/11/2012 5:42
692,1147, Google and amazon will merge. all searches will produce amazon results. you will use your wages from google or amazon to buy goods online from amazon.,4/16/1998 11:59
693,235, It's like the movie terminator! SKYNET IS OUT TO GET US!!!! haha it really is crazy how much stake Google has in the internet.,5/8/1999 1:12
693,235," google dominates, but there is always some upstart that unseats the dominant firm. i wonder who that will be.",7/18/1975 13:29
693,235," Well Google falls under Alphabet now, so I feel like they are getting prepared for that!",6/21/1991 0:10
693,235," Yes, from A to Z, they will control everything. oh, well. i for one hail our new corporate overlords.",10/9/1998 16:43
693,693, Apple even has a big piece of everything. Do you have an iPhone and use Siri?,11/29/1983 0:50
693,693, I dont have an iphone. too expensive. i really dont want an electronic pacifier in my pocket LOL,11/25/1982 1:38
693,693, haha I have the iPhone SE which came out like 5 years ago haha. I hardly ever use Siri but people love her!,9/21/1983 2:38
693,693, Siri is probably convenient but isnt it always listening to you? i dont want that kind of eavesdropping.,1/8/2001 7:15
693,235, I'm sure it is. Apple must have a lot of boring data on me haha. ,6/24/1982 23:56
693,693," Yeah, me too, and i dont even use Apple. LOL anyway, great chat!",10/3/2002 4:14
694,1959, Thanks you as well. Have a good night!,4/3/2018 16:06
694,694, hi how are you? do you like to dance?,5/29/2012 2:20
694,694, I like to watch it. I know Bruce Lee was a great dancer and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958.,12/18/1979 0:24
694,1959, i cant say that im surprised. he must have had a great sense of rhythm. i bet he was a real ladies' man.,6/10/1994 22:11
694,1959," Yeah, I bet. Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week.",11/20/1986 12:40
694,694," if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really.",5/3/2017 20:35
694,1959, Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent?,1/26/1977 17:49
694,694, is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius.,4/10/1978 3:02
694,694, It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.,12/27/1986 21:44
694,1959," yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young.",2/21/1976 20:21
695,1751," Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger.",4/19/1989 17:20
695,1751, i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well.,6/12/2011 20:38
695,1751," Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet.",2/17/1996 21:29
695,695, I use smile when i hit a bet too. LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school.,3/18/1985 1:11
695,1751," Yeah, I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS.",5/5/1981 0:57
695,1751," I bet he was really good too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground later on. by the way, are you a fan of snakes?",9/13/2005 1:58
695,695, No. I'm not crazy about snakes. There's no snakes in New Zealand.,8/20/2011 5:10
695,695, so ive heard. i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes. i have never seen a flying snake. that would be frightening.,8/21/1977 13:47
695,1751," No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs.",3/24/2013 1:35
695,1751," oh, ok. The fear of snakes is hard-wired  in human brains. i guess that makes sense. we needed it for evolution.",10/23/1997 9:38
696,376," Yeah, can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes.",4/7/2022 15:45
696,696," i guess scales and feathers are analogous? i never know they were related. Anyway, great chat!",2/16/1973 13:16
696,376," Yeah, good talking with you too!",12/2/2013 11:51
696,696," Hi! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction, however!",5/1/1982 0:52
696,376," hi how are you? I have heard of it. it is a movie that came out recently, right?",1/23/2003 9:33
696,696," Not too long ago and it's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie, black comedy and mystery! Drew Goddard directed it as well!",10/13/1975 18:22
696,376, A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously?,3/13/1982 15:36
696,696," Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough!",10/30/1997 5:00
696,696," I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary. ",7/20/1985 21:18
696,696," That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more! I need to try that!",10/16/1984 17:41
697,697, How does that even work? is your brain more active? more emotionally sensitive?,12/5/2014 8:56
697,697," I would imagine so. It's so weird, isn't it? I tell you what else is weird, Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched. Can you believe that? He definitely has a twisted mind, doesn't he?",12/28/1981 22:49
697,1942, He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended up fascinated with the macabre.,12/16/2016 17:51
697,697, Agreed! You know what else gets me? Danny from The Shining didn't actually know he was acting in a horror movie until years later. It's like how did he not know?,8/16/2019 4:28
697,1942, I guess he was ....slow? i dont know. what kind of movie did he imagine it to be?,9/23/1975 0:49
697,697," That's what I'm wondering. Ha! But enough of this horror talk, or else I'm going to get scared. Ha! Are you a fantasy fan at all? I'd like to join the national spelling bee fantasy draft one of these days!",11/17/2013 21:04
697,1942, I have never down fantasy sports. I guess the appeal is that you compete and can make some money?,10/3/2002 6:52
697,1942, I guess so! But I also think it's cool that a single fold in our brains basically separate how we perceive reality and fantasy. That's truly amazing!,11/4/2011 4:00
697,1942, I wonder if my fold has come unfolded in recent years. i feel that my time on the internet has blurred the line.,2/3/2016 19:25
697,697," Ha! I know what you mean. It is hard to distinguish at times, isn't it? Maybe we should start writing fantasy. Then hopefully we can be knighted for our services to literature like author Terry Pratchett was!",10/11/1981 8:03
698,1418, Terry is a great writer. He deserves the recognition. do we have to call him sir terry though?,10/1/1978 22:31
698,698," I suppose he's earned that title. Ha! On a similar fantasy note  (if you would consider this movie fantasy like I kind of do), do you like Thor? I think it's crazy Ant Man of all characters made his Marvel debut before Thor and even Hulk, Iron Man and Spider Man! Isn't that unbelievable?",8/8/2015 18:55
698,1418," I havent seen thor. I guess it could be good. i like the norse myths. Anyway, great chat!",7/3/1972 22:31
698,1418," It's a great movie! Marvel Studios produced it and Paramount distributed it. Plus it was directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by both Zack Stentz and Ashley Edward Miller! Well, it was great chatting with you as well! Hope you have a good night, friend!",12/17/1974 18:12
698,698," Yes, i enjoyed chatting too! Have a good weekend!",8/27/1980 7:22
698,698," And same to you! Be sure to check out Thor this weekend. If you like Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Natalie Portman or Chris Hemsworth, then this is the movie for you! Ha! Take care, friend!",2/16/1995 5:48
698,698, Good morning! As someone who suffers from ophiophobia. I am pleased to learn there are no snakes in New Zealand. ,10/12/2021 9:16
698,1418, I hate snakes. ,8/31/2020 22:09
698,1418, Did you know that there is even a flying snake? ,12/9/2018 12:57
698,1418," No I did not.  But crocodiles, which I also hate, are related more to birds than snakes. ",9/17/2015 19:51
699,699," I like the crocs, and I guess monkey's share our fear of snakes.",1/5/1981 16:40
699,309," They must be smart, lol.  What about the legless lizards.  They look like snakes ",4/30/1995 16:58
699,699," I don't like those either, nor eels. I do think it's fascinating that they have their paired organs one in front of another, opposed to side-by-side.",9/4/1995 3:43
699,699," That is fascinating.  I also think that the fact that In Britain, politicians had tomwear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998.",10/8/1988 21:10
699,699," That's insane. Kinda like people thinking that in the old west, the bowler was most popular, not the cowboy hat.",5/3/1996 9:51
699,309," Oh really, neat.  When someone tips their hat to you, it originated from knights lifting their face visors to show friendliness.",12/31/1987 17:00
699,309," I did know that! It was explained to us at Medieval Times. Yet, the length of ladies hatpins were regulated, so they could not be used as a weapon.",12/31/1974 15:58
699,309, That sounds reasonable.  Some hats even have religious fuct,9/25/1977 13:09
699,699, Do you know what the function of the turban worn by Sikhs is?,1/6/2006 2:02
699,699," No but I know it's a religious thing, just like mitres worn by Bishops.",6/9/2001 23:31
700,700," The chef's Toque is just silly, it gets in the way and looks like a coffee filter.",6/3/2012 4:33
700,590," lol, yes it does.  Do you like to Dance?  Did you know that Bruce Lee was actually a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha cha championship in 1958.",6/11/1985 4:20
700,700, I don't dance. I am not cordinated at all. I like watching people dance. I think its cute how babies break out in dance when they hear music.,7/26/2022 6:42
700,590, That is adorable.  My wife has a degree in dance.  She told me that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pair of pointe shoes in a week.,9/26/1998 22:17
700,700," I think it's fascinating that Michael Jackson's shoes were responsible for that extreme lean in his dance moves, I always thought he wore disguised pointe shoes.",7/19/1997 5:29
700,590, I also saw he has a patent on the device used for that lean.,11/13/1985 9:25
700,590, That is insane. Almost as crazy as Tupac being a ballet dancer in high school.,9/7/1987 17:49
700,700," Well, have a great day.",7/13/1982 4:47
700,590, Are you a fan of horror films? ,9/21/1989 3:33
700,700, I am a definite no on that!,2/28/1999 19:19
701,3," I'm not either to be honest. What about Fantasy films, do you watch them? ",5/24/2006 11:42
701,3, I'll take back a bit. I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories!,6/7/1992 4:56
701,701," Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies? ",10/12/1976 14:11
701,701, Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King.,7/10/1971 18:26
701,701," I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end. ",5/19/1980 20:00
701,701, I'm glad. I know if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will enjoy the art more.,6/17/2002 0:53
701,3," Interesting, any type of specific artists, or just abstract art? ",7/18/2007 13:08
701,3, I think just abstract art. ,2/25/2007 15:31
701,701," Ok, I wonder why that is. Any ideas as to why this occurs? ",4/25/1982 14:09
701,701, None at all. It's hard to believe Danny the boy from the shining did not know he was acting in horror film.,10/1/2015 11:55
702,702, Interesting. I didn't know that. Did you know that they have fantasy draft spelling bees? ,3/22/1999 2:08
702,702," No, I did not. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy. ",4/15/1999 19:01
702,1307," Interesting, I didn't realize that. Have you heard of the fantasy called In the Realms of the Unreal?",3/28/1987 3:55
702,702," No, what is it about?",10/19/2021 22:25
702,702," It's apparently a fantasy, but I'm not sure what it is about. ",3/24/1994 19:55
702,1307," Oh, okay. I know fantasy has evolved into various media including film, TV, graphic novels and more!",5/28/2022 23:40
702,702," Wow! That is really cool. What about Thor, have you seen it? ",9/13/1974 15:09
702,702, I have heard of Thor. I know it is a 2011 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics character of the same name.,12/16/1993 18:03
702,1307," Yeah, it is pretty good. I saw the first one and kind of liked it. ",7/25/1980 11:53
702,702, Did you happen to see Bad Times at the El Royale?,8/30/2014 13:51
703,272," I did, and I thought it was much better than what I expected, what about you?",10/12/1983 20:19
703,703, I went to the theater. I know it did not do well in the theater and that's too bad. It was good and I'm a big fan of Drew Goddard and Jeff Bridges. ,1/8/1993 7:36
703,272," I liked Cynthias performance I thought she was pretty good, I liked that each had a different skeleton and hidden problems",2/28/2007 16:06
703,703, Yes she was amazing. I liked the intrigue and mystery as well. Drew Goddard also did Cabin in the Woods. Are you a fan of horror movies?,5/24/1974 7:02
703,703," I am a fan of horro movies, what about you? do you like them?",2/29/1972 11:24
703,272, I love them. Did you know that watching horror movies burns over 180 calories?,10/21/2021 7:12
703,703," I didnt, I guess Im going to watch a few this weekend lol, do you know who Stephen King is?",7/6/1971 23:48
703,703, I love Stephen King. My book shelf that just hold his works is literally bowing from the weight. ,8/8/1977 20:46
703,272, Well aparently he was afraid of Bambi and that was the first horror movie he ever watched.,6/26/1978 3:26
703,272," I can see that being very upsetting. Old Disney movies are brutal. Speaking of King, the boy who played Danny in The Shining was not aware they were filming a horror movie. ",12/26/1973 3:29
704,1467," I wonder how that worked lol, it was a really scary movie, probably best if they tricked him.",2/18/2018 6:08
704,1467, I totally agree. It's intense. Have you ever heard of an instrument called a waterphone?,4/11/1990 15:20
704,704," I havent heard of that instrument, I wonder how its used or its applications!",12/18/1996 13:48
704,704, It's actually used to make the creepy metallic noises you hear in horror movies. I always wondered what made that sound. ,10/6/2014 15:02
704,1467," Oh I see, I wonder how it sounds like thoug, do you like fantasy?",8/9/2004 15:01
704,704, I like some fantasy. I like Terry Pratchett who was knighted for his works and he certainly deserved that honor. ,12/4/2007 2:17
704,704," He was knighted because of his apportations to literature right? Im more of a Superhero fan, I guess that counts as fantasy as well. ",7/31/1989 8:56
704,704, That is correct. I can see that counting. I think fantasy drafting has become out of control. People have fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee now!,3/21/1970 23:45
704,704, Thats crazy lol I heard about congress fantasy but spelling bee fantasy?!! thats just weird,10/1/1990 18:32
704,1467, It has definitely gone way too far. ,3/10/1990 7:52
705,1147, Isn't it amazing that British politicians were forced by law to wear a top hat.,8/22/1997 23:17
705,705, I wonder what the story is on that. I'm going to look up bowler hat,7/29/1992 6:45
705,1147, The bowler hats were extremely popular in the old west.,3/26/1994 2:15
705,705, I looked at a picture of bowler hat. I think I like cowboy hat better. Or those Mexican hats. Those are cool,1/31/1981 16:27
705,705," They do look very similar to the cowboy hats, no wonder they were so popular.",7/16/1991 9:41
705,705, They are cute but maybe that's why I don't like them. I don't see kippa mentioned ,10/29/2009 20:19
705,1147, I like to wear hate. I tip my hat to greet people when I'm wearing one.,7/14/2020 20:31
705,1147, I don't like to wear a hat unless it's to keep the sun out of my face,8/19/1979 12:17
705,705, Are you afraid of snakes?,9/8/1992 17:34
705,1147," No, I think they are kind of cool. We have a snake man around here who visits jails and hospitals with his snakes. The kids love it",1/4/1984 9:46
706,706," That's surprising. Like most people and other primates, I'm so afraid of snakes.",12/15/1984 6:20
706,706, oh ya I saw this cat video where people had a cucumber and the cat thinks it's a snake and freaks out ,10/27/1971 18:35
706,706, I guess chats are scared of snakes too then. There are places in the world where there are no snakes at all.,10/15/2008 18:59
706,706," I meant to write Reptile man, not snake man. He has a webpage",3/29/1971 13:07
706,1193, I think snakes are reptile. Snakes are different from lizards though.,5/28/2022 16:30
706,1193, I'm going to look up legless lizard,12/7/1975 11:00
706,706," I've seen those before, they look like snakes, but they're not snakes.",4/8/2016 17:51
706,1193," wow, interesting! My daughter works for a veterinarian that sees pretty much any kind of animal",2/15/2002 4:30
706,706," There are so many types of snakes, I'm sure she has seen all of them including flying snakes!",3/3/1999 23:17
706,1193, I should ask her. People have all kinds of pets like turtles and spiders,12/17/2003 10:42
707,707, I just have a dog as my pet.,8/3/2018 2:36
707,707," Hey hows it going, do you like fantasy or horror films the most?",4/18/2017 9:18
707,628, horror is the best. I love Edgar Allan Poe,12/15/2018 1:08
707,628," The Raven is such a great book. I like both, I get scared easily at horror movies though but do with fantasy, they are both great though.",12/6/1990 13:09
707,628, I did not know that scream was going to be titled scary movie.,12/29/1976 23:14
707,628," Yah, what are those called, dark comedies right? ",1/7/2011 15:21
707,628, yes. The actors in the exorcist never knew that they were making a horror film. lol,5/5/2013 19:47
707,628," It's crazy, I think a lot of people are like that in real life too, I wish more people would realize that it could be us like that. Isn't it nuts that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy? ",3/19/2021 3:22
707,707, Thats deep. People could learn more about this at an actual university,12/21/2008 9:22
707,707," They could, too bad not everyone has access to a university though, would help everyone out a lot if it was more profitable, the inequality gap in the US is getting ridiculous!",8/22/1971 1:21
708,708, Did you ever see Thor that came out in 2011 ?,12/9/2020 9:52
708,554," I did, I remember watching it in the movie theater, it's the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loki seems like a bad guy you can root for, or am I mistaken?",10/31/2001 1:51
708,554, I have never seen it. I do like Chris Hemsworth,10/27/2013 0:34
708,554," Yah he is a good actor, I like Natallie Portman and Tom HIddleston too, both great actors and actresses!",4/17/1972 1:58
708,554, I agree but Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are the best,3/30/2008 7:47
708,708," Idris Elba is a great actor, did you see The Wire at all?",6/17/1980 1:19
708,554, one of the best shows ever. So Jim henson created 'the dark crystal' ? I did not know that,11/1/2005 16:57
708,554," I did not know that, Jim Henson created Seasame Street right?",12/21/1970 13:56
708,708," yes i grew up on that. I would love to see that 15,145-page fantasy manuscript ",8/29/2003 17:04
708,554, Or what about a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee? That's nuts people do that too. I wonder what Seasame Street would be like as a horror or fantasy show?,9/18/2005 6:32
709,709, lol good question. the lord of the rings won an academy award for best picture Good movie !,5/21/2016 22:23
709,1621," I'm sure it was a good movie, I really can't get into that type of fantasy movies, same with Game of Thrones, I know they are great pieces of art and so good, I just don't really like watching them, there is a lot of good take aways from the movies though about how the world should be. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature, and he's a comedic fantasy author.",4/17/1981 1:15
709,709, Very good point. I love all Fantasy movies in both literature and drama. enjoy your fantasy movies !,1/22/1970 1:53
709,709," Hey! Did you know that until 1998, British politicians had to wear a top hat when making a point of order in the house of commons?",6/7/2012 10:14
709,1621," I did not know that, but it could be because hats are worn for various reasons which include ceremonial ones, like the house of commons!",12/28/2019 23:05
709,1621," Exactly. The most popular hat in the Old West was actually the bowler, not the Cowboy hat.",12/30/1971 20:40
709,1621," So you are saying that all of the westerns have got it wrong? Haha, all of the cowboys should have been wearing bowler hats, doesn't make them seem quite as tough. ",10/2/1978 6:49
709,1621," I guess so! I was surprised when I learned that. Imagine the Marlboro cowboy in a bowler! That wouldn't work though, because a cowboy really does need a cowboy hat to protect against the sun and rain.",6/25/2000 22:16
709,709," I agree, it is just not the same. You know how cowboys would tip their hats in greeting? That originated from knights raising their face visors to show they were friendly. ",3/19/2000 9:32
709,709," That's very interesting and makes sense. How do you feel about snakes? I'm not a big fan. I'd go to New Zealand, where there are none.",5/10/1970 18:16
710,1761," I would be joining you in New Zealand. Snakes make my skin crawl, always have. It is a long held fear of mine. New Zealand is lucky!",8/10/1972 2:59
710,1761, Yeah that's how I feel too! There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves. If I saw that in person I would die.,10/24/2012 12:52
710,1761," I would as well, it is bad enough to see them slither around, but flying...no! I was reading that the fear of snakes is hard-wired not just in human brains, but in monkey brains as well. ",9/19/2012 4:43
710,1761," Well humans and monkeys are distantly related lol. There are legless lizards also. I don't mind legged lizards, but I don't think I would look at a legless lizard as anything less than a snake.",11/17/1998 22:10
710,1761," If it doesn't have legs, I am checking out. A legless lizard is a snake! You know, I was reading that crocodiles are closer related to birds then snakes and lizards. I would have never guessed that. ",10/19/1980 5:44
710,710," Haha checking out. Agreed. I wouldn't have guessed that about crocodiles either. I always call alligators/crocodiles dinosaurs, and I heard that chickens are likely descendants of dinosaurs.. so maybe I am onto something? ",2/18/1992 19:03
710,710," If you have seen Jurassic park and believe it (I kinda do) then you would agree. Hey, do you like dancing? Did you know that it can be categorized and described by its choreography. I am horrible, but its fun. ",7/23/1971 6:38
710,1761, I love Jurassic Park and I do love dancing. I'm not the best dancer either but I have a good time. Apparently Bruce Lee was a great dancer and won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,6/17/1978 9:54
710,1761, I bet that is why he was so good at martial arts. Dancing probably helped keep him limber and light on his feet. I feel like those would be important skills to have. ,4/8/2001 22:56
710,710," Good point! Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat! I can attest to that, I have one at home and he loves music.",2/11/2006 10:32
711,1267," That is adorable, baby dancing is the best, it is so pure for the joy of it! You know who else was a dancer? Tupac, he danced ballet. That is unexpected. ",3/6/1980 23:45
711,711, Whoa I didn't know that and I'm a Tupac fan. Very unexpected! Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I know he wasn't wearing those though.,7/7/2007 14:08
711,711," No, can you imagine him performing California Love wearing point shoes and doing ballet? It would be funny, but probably ruin the effect of the song. ",6/17/2006 17:27
711,711, Hahahaha very true. Well I thoroughly enjoyed this chat! Have a wonderful day/night!,9/3/2001 16:11
711,711," Same to you, take care!!!",5/15/2014 3:52
711,1267, You as well.,12/23/1990 11:33
711,711, Hi do you like DIsney?,4/27/2003 15:39
711,1267, Yeah I do. Do you know what the real name of Minnie is?,3/19/2018 20:30
711,711, Yes her name is Minerva but I like Minnie better,12/12/2021 18:35
711,711, Yeah me too. Have you heard about the culture of hidden mickey mouse?,7/24/1995 4:13
712,712, Yeah they hide stuff on everything disney for people to find,8/22/1987 11:16
712,712, Yeah pretty cool. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,8/14/1999 17:18
712,1041, Yeah the is the science guy and he worked with disney for the Flubber movies,6/1/2018 23:26
712,1041, Yeah he is in a lot of things now. Do you like the Pixar studio movies?,10/6/2014 2:24
712,1041," I love them especially wall-e, have you seen it?",8/12/1992 20:29
712,1041, I have and loved it. Do you know who it is a tip of the hat to?,5/24/2001 0:34
712,1041," Yes to Walter Elias Disney, which is very fitting as he started the whole thing",2/18/2001 21:07
712,712, Yeah it is fitting indeed. DO you use google a lot?,7/31/2022 13:44
712,1041," Yes I do, is the got to search engine for me. Do you know when it was founded?",2/11/2018 10:44
712,712, Yes in 1998 so it has been around for a while now and I am glad for it,6/15/1989 16:54
713,713, Me too. DO you know how they calculate traffic?,11/1/1981 1:21
713,283, Yes they actually take the average of how fast android devices are moving,10/29/2014 1:08
713,713, Yes. They once hired goats to mow their lawn instead of people,2/2/1999 23:21
713,283," Yeah that is pretty neat, everyone benefited there",9/17/2000 2:21
713,713, Exactly. A single google search uses more computing power than it took to sen 12 astronauts to the moon,4/6/2003 20:53
713,713, That is insane indeed. It once went down for 5 minutes and took 40% of traffic with it,10/9/1999 11:07
713,283," No wonder they are this big, so many people are using them",9/1/1999 2:52
713,713, Hello there hope you're doing well. Do you like the fantasy genre? I like it because it's roots are in oral traditions.,8/28/2008 11:35
713,283, I like fantasy drafts. Lol,7/13/2016 6:03
713,283, Yeah fantasy drafts are fun- and even fantasy drafts are done for the national spelling bee!,11/17/1975 6:01
714,714, I haven't ever done that. There is also a draft for congress.,9/3/1971 11:53
714,714, Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring. A single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.,5/5/2008 6:25
714,714, Have you ever heard of terry pratchett,3/3/2017 11:17
714,714, Yeah I think so I can't believe he was knighted for services to literature. He must have made some great contributions.,3/4/1993 16:46
714,1230, He really has. What an honor as well.,8/28/2014 15:19
714,714, Yeah he must've been so proud. There was once a janitor from Chicago who wrote over six years of fantasy manuscript. He must've really been into it.,7/18/1988 2:21
714,714, Yeah that is a long time to write something. He must have been really devoted.,6/26/2013 23:02
714,714, Agreed. I bet he would've love to work for Disney. Bill Nye actually work for Disney as a consultant for Disney's flubber.,12/28/1981 19:42
714,1230, really. Thats cool. I always liked bill nye,2/6/1996 4:07
714,1230, Yeah he seems like a good guy. The Disney character Minnie mouse's name is short for Minerva mouse.,1/8/1970 11:16
715,715, I heard that actually.,10/28/2007 11:42
715,715, Yeah I think it's interesting I never knew it. There's a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney. I didn't know they hid things.,3/28/1974 20:18
715,1180, You would think they would have better stuff to do.,6/1/1990 18:54
715,1180," Yeah some people have too much time on their hands. Disney's big hero six was rendered using a 55,000 core super computer. Wow.",3/19/1986 17:58
715,1180, Have you ever seen Wall-E,7/2/2003 8:05
715,1180," Nope I have never seen that movie, is it good? It looks like Pixar honored Walter Elias Disney in the name.",3/21/2017 18:51
715,1180, Yeap they sure did. ,10/9/2002 21:22
715,715, I love having Google because I can look up anything I don't know. A single search requires a ton of computing power.,8/28/2011 4:54
715,715, Have you ever read a wrinkle in time?,4/21/2004 19:25
715,715, I have not. What is it about?,9/26/2001 17:11
716,1896, It is a fantasy where the main hero is a little girl. Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication. ,7/14/2012 21:28
716,1896, Interesting. There is a university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies.,8/15/1973 6:29
716,1896, That would be an amazing class! I think there is so much to be learned from those great books. ,12/5/2008 12:41
716,1896, I think so too. Jim Henson created The Dark Crystal with the idea that it was unhealthy for children never to be afraid.,4/6/1970 13:47
716,716, Hmm I could see that being true. If children have no fear then they are liable to get into anything. Healthy fear isn't a bad thing. ,8/5/2014 10:12
716,716, I agree. Do you like Walt Disney?,9/17/2008 6:16
716,716, I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You?,11/21/2011 9:52
716,716," Yep, I like Walt Disney. The Disney channel doesn't accept outside ads. Did you know that?",2/2/2005 21:33
716,716, I didn't know that. Makes sense though because then they can direct traffic toward their products and shows. ,7/3/1973 14:44
716,1896, Yep I agree. Walt Disney and Salvador Dali once collaborated on a short film.,4/2/2015 1:11
717,717, That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles. ,1/6/2013 15:34
717,404," Yea those are both good ones. Disney makes $1,110 per second.",10/8/2018 13:45
717,404, Wow that is just a insane amount of money. Hopefully they are doing some good work with all that cash. ,7/27/2008 13:54
717,404, I bet they are. Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough.,2/14/1976 22:38
717,404, That seems very strange but I guess the times where different on what people considered entertainment. ,8/26/1979 11:27
717,404, Do you use Google?,8/23/2022 13:25
717,717, I do use it quite a bit. Gmail is great. Do you like it?,8/29/2009 12:14
717,717, I love Google. I pretty much use it daily.,12/3/1970 4:48
717,404, I think they are probably the most used site ever. Look at what happened back in 2013 when it went down for 5 minutes. Internet use dropped 40%!,1/31/2013 9:22
717,404, It was good talking to you.,9/18/1983 15:48
718,315," A Wrinkle in Time was a great film with an interesting cast, what are your thoughts?",1/4/1988 16:17
718,718," Well, good morning.  I actually have never seen that movie, have you?",7/25/2007 6:38
718,315," I have, its actually pretty good, you should watch it, Oprah  Winfrey is a part of the cast",1/10/1984 9:22
718,315," Well, anything with Ms. O in it is probably pretty good.  I'll give it a look when I get a chance.",10/18/1971 5:10
718,315," You should, I think it was also a book, well best movies come out of great books",11/15/1975 0:15
718,315," Yes, they do. Do you watch Disney Channel?",11/30/2000 13:35
718,315," I do like the Disney Channel yeah, why do you ask?",2/27/2006 16:13
718,718, Do you know they don't accept outside ads.  The only commercials it airs are for its own shows and Disney products?,5/17/1998 7:35
718,718," It seems like they are loosing a lot of money there, did you watch the movie Big Hero 6?",12/9/1982 16:53
718,718," I don't think so.  Yes, I loved Big Hero 6, so did my kids.  Speaking of Disney, did you know Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough?",9/10/1971 22:13
719,719," Well the movie Big Hero 6 was made with a 55000 core super computer, amazing right? and he was fired wow, that is funny and ironic",8/14/1989 5:26
719,719," Amazing, what a computer that was.  Did you know that Walt Disney and Salvadore Dali collaborated on a short film?",2/13/1985 9:51
719,719," I didnt, no, I might have to Google that later, do you know Bill Nye the science guy?",7/6/1975 17:54
719,719," Yes, I've watched him many times on tv.",3/3/2013 7:58
719,1426," And what about the movie Flubber, do you remember that movie?",5/2/1973 8:52
719,1426," Yes, I do. Old version and the newer one.",12/18/1992 17:59
719,1426," I didnt know there was a new version, anyway, he is the science consultant in the old version of the movie",7/28/2013 7:13
719,719," That's cool! Here's a fun fact for you, type the word, askew into Google and watch the page tilt.",10/11/2006 9:44
719,719, I just did it and nothing happened maybe they fixed that issue already.,4/19/2013 4:33
719,1426, Maybe so! Do you know new Google employees are called nooglers?,3/19/1991 11:12
720,974," That seems kind of messed up, I think the beanies are funny, the ones the make the nooglers wear.",7/7/1974 15:44
720,720,"  Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed?",8/13/2012 4:17
720,720, That is sad. I hope we can reverse that  statistic. ,9/1/1997 17:08
720,974, Yeah that is really sad.  I recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century. ,4/21/2006 2:55
720,720," I also think it is interesting that when earth was formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. I wonder why that changed?",8/2/1988 4:13
720,974," I don't know,  maybe it slowed its rotation eventually?  That's pretty weird.  ",4/15/1975 9:49
720,720, Do you believe in aliens? The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials. ,5/20/1989 18:21
720,974," Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens?",6/13/2004 4:07
720,974, I am not sure. I feel like there is more life out there. I wonder if they will make contact with earth?,11/17/1982 7:50
720,720," Im assuming so,  otherwise what would the ambassador have to study?  lol how else can he be prepared if theres no evidence?",5/11/2017 12:45
721,721, I am not sure. Do you have any pets? ,6/24/2006 7:40
721,721," Yup,  I have a dog.  How about you?",4/29/1987 0:37
721,721, I have a cat. Did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks!,12/12/2001 6:03
721,559," lol yeah,  theres all sorts of cafes like that,  Ive been to a meerkat cafe,  a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before. ",7/9/2021 19:24
721,559, That is really interesting. I would like that. I wish i slept as much as cats. When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping.,5/29/2012 12:09
721,721, Thats a lot of sleeping!  Theres is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol ,12/4/1973 19:22
721,721, I love that. It has been the mayor since 1997.,2/25/1988 12:32
721,559, lol I wonder how they decided that or what his duties are lol ,8/22/1993 19:49
721,559, I wonder if he is a stray. The cat in the godfather 1 opening scene was a stray that was found on set.,12/23/2004 16:23
721,559," Wow,  I hope that cat got paid,  thats a very popular movie!",8/19/1971 23:51
722,1748, I hope he was adopted after.,4/3/1993 14:58
722,722, lol yeah.  Its been fun chatting! ,8/5/1985 14:21
722,1748," As libraries close, I wonder if it is still true there are more libraries than mcdonalds.What do you think?",1/25/2014 15:42
722,722," I think its possible, They are very useful for everyone. The sacramento library even has a library of things",11/27/1992 3:18
722,722, A prisoner used the library resources to become a lawyer.,8/11/1981 11:45
722,1748, I know! it was a really good use of resources. He proved his innocence and now helps others do the same,6/7/1981 3:10
722,722," That's amazing. There are all kinds of old stats and info to discover, too.",6/22/2011 14:29
722,722, Yeah you can get unrestricted access to information in many different formats,4/3/2010 14:55
722,722, Appling was busted on an old baseball story because researchers contradicted his claim.,11/20/1975 1:35
722,722, I heard he was really good at fouling pitches. Including 14 straight.,10/23/1975 8:30
723,723, It would be great to see a new interview with him but he passed away in 1991.,8/9/2003 19:33
723,1187, Yeah I would like to hear his opinion on Belt's 21 pitch at bat,10/26/2017 16:35
723,723, I wonder if he would change when presented with the Yankees stats.,9/22/2009 20:11
723,1187, He had a good time playing against Red Ruffing. He liked messing with him,6/20/1985 0:59
723,723, It sounds like Appling used that strategy a lot.,3/28/1970 7:06
723,1187, Unfortunately we dont have enough stat going back far enough since at bats and pitch by pitch only started getting record in 1988,3/25/1988 4:37
723,723," He bragged about fouling out players,",2/19/1990 22:46
723,1187, Do you think Brandon Belt could do the same,6/2/2008 13:38
723,1187, He used the same strategy to run out 12 minutes 45 seconds of gametime.,3/3/2004 6:31
723,723, Thats a long time in baseball. 16 fouls,2/11/1971 15:38
724,1570, It is the longest at-bat since they kept stats on that.,6/15/1975 3:52
724,1570, Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play for their team?,5/2/1979 0:42
724,1570, So they're ready to go on the field and sub in?,11/15/1997 5:57
724,1570, I believe so! That would be something to see!,2/15/2017 15:29
724,1570," hey did you know that when I cat gets to be 15 years old, it has on average slept for about 10 years, so 2/3 of its lifespan",4/17/1976 23:20
724,1570, That doesn't surprise me actually.  i saw something funny the other day that in Japan that have what is called Cat Cafe's where people pay hourly to play with cats,10/29/2019 21:20
724,724," ha that is crazy, I just got back from a pet store and held a dog actually, I'm not much of a cat person, are you?",6/6/1994 14:22
724,1570," No, I'm not but was reading an article where the town of Talkeetna, AL has had a cat named Stubbs as it's mayor since 1997",8/10/2018 1:01
724,724," that is funny, I like the movie the Godfather a lot, apparently the cat used in the beginning scenes was found on the set and was actually a stray",3/11/1993 8:52
724,1570, What about birds. do you like them?  I think hummingbirds are amazing.  They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest,1/15/1978 1:27
725,1140," haha that is funny, I do like birds, I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds, like you're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw, but it's just a bird making that sound haha",7/17/1983 9:54
725,725, wow that would be scary!  I saw that the famously discint do do bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon ,3/29/2015 4:58
725,1140," that is wild, I know people hunted the dodo because they were eating them, so I guess if we want to know what they tasted like we could try pigeon haha",7/21/1987 0:47
725,1140, this is interesting.  In most birds the bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers,11/2/1983 4:38
725,1140," that is wild, I think it's crazy that there are birds that fly the distance of Alaska to Mexico without sleeping, thats a lot of endurance!",10/29/2021 9:47
725,1140, I saw that human activity threatens about 1200 bird species with extinction,9/1/1982 14:35
725,1140," ya that is sad, we are using up earth's resources, and I know that by the end of the 21st century we will have run out of helium which is very important for manufacturing",10/14/2008 0:05
725,725, Wow that is crazy.  more than 80 percent of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed,5/31/1987 14:15
725,1140," ya that is sad, what's really crazy is how quickly this is happening, so far humans would only represent about a minute if you consider the entire history of earth to be 24 hours long",11/22/2014 21:02
725,725, Ok so this is totally of subject but the united nations appointedd official ambassadors to extraterrestrials,12/22/1995 4:37
726,90," haha I wonder how they appointed that guy, like he essentially knows that he will never have to work, like what does that guy do all day? I want his job haha",10/8/1977 5:54
726,726, Exactly that is so funny!  Did you that over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival,12/28/2017 2:30
726,726," I didn't that's a ton of people, I wonder if an alien would be overwhelmed at the number of people on earth, like they would have to wonder how big of a planet this is and how it supports so much life",12/13/1996 11:52
726,90, Good question.  I read that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system and largest of the four terrestrial planets,9/10/1991 13:23
726,90," I could see that, what I really want is for scientists to find alien life in my lifetime though, we need to go back to the moon! haha",11/10/2002 18:20
726,90," hi, do you know much about planet earth?",1/31/2012 15:00
726,90, I know that 80 percent of our forests have already been destroyed,12/4/1984 10:27
726,726, yeah and that is so sad. did you know the day used to be 5.5 hours only ?,11/19/2001 20:59
726,90, It is really sad considering that humans have only been here a minute if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period. I did not know that about the day being so short,11/17/2008 18:51
726,90, Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet,11/24/2015 14:40
727,727," Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets. ",7/28/1987 16:04
727,727," haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century",11/26/1970 5:54
727,81, No more helium balloons? Aww...,8/11/1987 19:55
727,727," I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals",9/3/2007 19:33
727,727, I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon.,12/18/1983 12:01
727,727, Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers,3/18/1985 23:58
727,727," Yeah, this is due to their bones being hollow.",4/23/1972 22:48
727,727," yeah, I guess that makes sense for them since they need to fly",6/8/1981 2:07
727,727," Right. I think wild birds in Australia are neat but would probably drive me insane. They can mimic camera, car alarms, and chainsaw sounds.",7/3/2020 3:52
727,81," hahaha I can imagine that, going out everytime to check if the car is alright",5/6/2009 15:38
728,728, Another neat thing to observe would be a hummingbird stealing a spiderweb's nest!,10/5/2021 8:37
728,1632, they are so tiny and yet so smart,10/29/1970 3:47
728,728," Sorry, I meant stealing webs to repair their nests. Yeah, bird brains are tiny but they seem so intelligent!",5/14/1996 18:48
728,1632, That is true. How do you feel about cats?,11/9/1976 6:19
728,1632, I do not really like them but there is a stray cat that is super sweet and cuddles with me even though I tell her no. It is pretty cute. How about you?,6/15/2022 16:38
728,728, I like cats too. there are cafes of them in japan,4/14/1985 6:27
728,1632, Nice! I would love to be a cat. They spend a lot of time sleeping.,12/5/1972 4:31
728,728, Hello! How are you this morning?,3/21/2014 0:28
728,728, im doing well! sipping on my morning coffee. how about you?,11/30/1998 4:04
728,728, Same here! Enjoy that! Also enjoy helium because it's running out lol.,6/7/2018 3:49
729,992, it is??? no way! what are we going to fill out balloons with?,4/12/2018 6:23
729,992, I'm more worried about making funny voices lol. We are running out of so many things on this earth. Did you know 80 percent of forests have been destroyed?,2/15/2008 16:50
729,729," thats a sad thing to hear. but we still have a bunch, so imagine how many we used to have!",1/13/1993 19:14
729,992, I couldn't imagine! I wonder if that's why some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?,10/8/2015 18:45
729,729," they have to get to the warm, and fast! they must get tired making the long journey tho",11/15/2010 10:14
729,992," I'm sure they sleep for days haha. Birds are pretty smart. There are wilds birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws.",7/27/1991 16:31
729,729, That's so funny. I wonder what their accents are like. Because birds have accents!,4/19/2011 11:42
729,992," I'm picturing british and american birds talking to each other lol. I would like to see that, but also hang out with cats in Taiwan.",5/14/2011 22:32
729,729, id love to hear a bird with a cockneyed British accent. do you like cats?,11/25/1991 17:22
729,729," No I actually don't really like cats lol, but you can hang out with them at a cafe in Taiwan. I think that would be interesting.",5/17/1978 23:19
730,1585," that would be interesting, but i would avoid it, im allergic!",6/14/1998 20:37
730,1585, Wise person you are! Have you seen the godfather? I guess the cat in the opening scene was a stray they found on set!,5/25/2009 21:51
730,730, i actually havent but id love to. i wonder if they paid that cat SAG day rates,2/21/2002 18:31
730,730," haha or in cat treats? I envy the life of a cat, it spends most of its life sleeping lol.",2/11/2019 2:04
730,730," that would be fun, so much better than working all day long",6/16/1975 6:51
730,730, I agree! Would you ever want a cat as your town mayor?,11/25/1998 7:18
730,1585, haha it would about as useful as my current mayor....what town elected a cat???,5/31/1970 2:44
730,730," It was Talkeetna, Alaska! I'm going to look more into that now! Have a great day. Awesome chat!",2/12/2010 2:47
730,730," Hello there, do you follow baseball or MLB much?",1/2/2013 10:35
730,1585," I do, although I haven't followed it much the past couple of years.",8/29/1987 1:55
731,816," I am the opposite, I have been following more closely these last few, especially this last season as my team almost made the world series. ",12/15/2006 5:15
731,731," Oh, which team is that? Is it the Cubs? They were the first team to win back to back World Series.",10/20/1980 19:34
731,731," No, I am a fan of the Brewers, I have never seen them play in a series, one game away.  ",4/12/2011 1:58
731,816, What was the longest at bat you've ever seen? There is some question as to what the longest at bat ever was.,1/23/2008 16:13
731,731," I don't know probably only 20 pitches or so, but I figure the longest is pretty darn long.  Did you know managers can technically play if needed?",12/4/1971 9:00
731,816," I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Also, apparently the longest at bat ever was 21 pitches. ",8/15/1997 17:59
731,731," That is all, that doesn't seem like very many considering a full count is minimal 5 pitches.  ",3/13/2020 2:06
731,731," Well, apparently there is some dispute. The 'story' doesn't match any game on record, but the story has been told for over 70 years.",2/22/2017 17:49
731,816," Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988, so who knows what it was before that. ",9/7/2011 22:19
731,816," Yeah, I guess 1998 is considered the modern era. Before that teams didn't watch stats too closely.",5/16/1994 21:03
732,973," That is crazy, that doesn't see that long ago.  I'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then. ",6/2/2003 12:04
732,732," Cy Young apparently won 435 games, now 200 is considered incredible. ",2/5/2021 10:55
732,732," Holy cow that is a crazy amount of baseball games to win, not just start, but win. ",1/27/2017 21:58
732,973, I can see why they named the yearly pitching trophy after him.,1/14/2003 19:38
732,732, Yeah I agree with you on that. Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball up in Canada?,9/16/1971 16:22
732,732, I didn't know that. Did you by chance read about that in the library which is a collection of information sources?,7/13/2003 13:29
732,732, Yeah isn't that pretty funny?  I read that in some random facts I saw online.  ,6/10/2019 18:29
732,973," Ha, I like random facts. Did you know North Korea holds the record for the largest mass gymnastic performance?",6/25/1974 20:10
732,973," No, I didn't know that, what a weird record to go after.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",3/5/1990 6:46
732,973, Do you like game of thrones?,7/24/1994 19:44
733,733," I do, its one of my favorite shows, Dacid Benioff is a genious, so much imagination, do you like the show?",12/10/2000 9:53
733,733, I do. He did a good job adapting Martin's fantasy novels into a tv series.,6/15/2001 21:41
733,733," George R. R. Martin is one of my favorite writters as well, I didnt know the show was filmed in Ireland, the country has beutiful landscapes",12/19/1974 5:27
733,406, They did a good job worldbuilding and making a somewhat medieval setting,3/27/2016 12:33
733,406," Yeah and also picking up the cast, like Harry Lloyd, he is a decendant of Dickens",9/3/2003 23:38
733,733, Ya an talisa maegyr is played by charlie chaplin's granddaughter,2/7/2009 15:48
733,733," A lot of talent in the show, there is a natgeo show called Game of Lions, seems like a fun show to watch lol",4/30/1977 4:27
733,406, Well another good decision aside from the scene the director made is to film it in ireland. They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage tourism,6/3/1978 11:59
733,733," I wonder if that strategy works for the country, I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show",3/4/1971 23:58
733,733, I'm sure it does. Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got,3/15/2010 19:16
734,734," I liked the second story arc, that one was amazing what about you?",12/28/1972 22:23
734,1049, I like the 3rd arc since it makes everything else pale and insignificant in comparison. Oh but I liked it when jeffry died,1/5/1986 10:03
734,734," Yeah Jeffry had it coming, it was a fair death, he was a cruel boy and the actor was pretty good",2/10/2004 10:41
734,1049, Are you excited for the 8th season?,2/19/2021 16:16
734,734," I am, too bad its going to be the final one but I guess the show will leave on a high note",10/23/1982 12:40
734,1049," Honestly, I have no clue how they are going to fit all the action and story into 1 season when it took 7 to get here. I just hope it doesn't feel rushed or left a a cliff hanger. In any case, since the 3rd arc focuses on the legendary dangers of the north threatening the known realm, there will be a battle to remember",11/18/2020 17:48
734,734," Thats a sure thing, it will be a battle to remember and it feels rushed, theres a lot more the show can give us, I like how Arya acts as well, she has become a badass",10/10/1970 7:53
734,734, I guess it is due to her success that the name Arya is rapidly becoming the popular girl baby name,7/16/2001 4:48
734,1049, Its funny how a show can have an influence even on things like that one,3/3/1982 16:24
734,734," Indeed. In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat about got and I hope you enjoy the 8th season",11/14/1980 7:28
735,1013," Hi, how are you?",9/27/1984 21:27
735,735," Hi, I'm doing good how are you?",11/29/1981 14:35
735,735," I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you watch Game of Thrones?",1/8/2016 1:47
735,735," I've never actually seen GOT. The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show.",3/3/1993 17:26
735,735," I've watched it a few times, it's a pretty good show.I've never seen the National Geographic show called Game of lions, though.  Have you?",7/9/2005 20:22
735,735," No, I can't say that I have. I haven't even heard of that either. What did you like about Game of Thrones?",2/26/1997 17:37
735,735," I like fantasy type shows and this one has a large cast with several plot lines going on at the same time.  It holds your interest and is never boring. Scenery is beautiful, it gets filmed in Ireland, Canada Iceland, Malta Scotland, Spain, and the U.S.",8/30/1971 23:17
735,1013, I think the only guy I really know from the show is Peter Dinklage because he won an Emmy for being on the show.,2/18/1975 13:33
735,1013," Well. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talis on the show, also.",7/20/1995 20:52
735,735, That is interesting! The show comes on HBO right? I'll have to check it out sometime.,10/17/2010 10:02
736,933," Yes, it does.  Just binge watch it, all seven seasons.  The eighth season doesn't premiere until April, so you have some time to get up to speed, it's worth watching!",10/18/1981 9:30
736,933, Eight seasons? That means it came out in 2011. That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful.,4/6/2017 20:35
736,736," Yeah, that long.  It has a big following, so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S.",1/9/2015 3:28
736,933, That is a little disturbing. Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show. I think the actor that played Arya was actually her first role in anything.,3/23/2014 6:00
736,736," I know right.  I wouldn't either, but some people are very big fans. Lol",12/2/1981 17:09
736,933, I'm not that big of a fan of anything. Lots of celebrities are overrated. In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity.,8/26/1985 13:00
736,933," Me either and I remember when Paris Hilton was everywhere.  I wish the Kardashians would go the same way.  They are way overrated, as well.  ",4/18/2019 17:05
736,736," Yeah, the Kardashians are the very definition of celebrity. They garner so much public attention by mass media and I have no clue what they are actually known for.",11/23/2009 16:35
736,933, I don't think nobody does. Lol Do you know that Robin Williams started the trens of celebrities doing the voices in animated movies?  He was the best doing the Genie's voice in Aladdin.,5/18/2011 15:50
736,933," I didn't know he was responsible foe that at all. That is very interesting, but I did know he was the voice of Genie. The guy was a national treasure.",1/25/1999 4:46
737,737," Yes, he was, gone much too soon. Well, it's been nice talking with you this morning.  I hope you have a good day. ",6/28/2000 1:47
737,737, Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),11/30/2009 18:53
737,737," Hi, how are you doing?",6/1/2001 6:35
737,585, pretty good thx :) Did You hear the universe may be one giant superhologram ? I can't seem to wrap my head around it... can You ?,8/28/2012 3:38
737,737," i did not, that would be pretty wild, they should make a commercial about that",4/22/1997 13:38
737,737," They should make a National Geographic special ! lol, even then I don't know if I would understand that... ",1/28/1987 16:20
737,737, they should! i like the theory that there is one electron in the universe!,9/19/1991 2:07
737,585, ugh... another one... I'm Polish man... cut me some slack here :),5/3/1996 11:55
737,585, I am sorry?,6/30/2002 1:03
737,585, I am too... :) I'm saying it's another subject I don't understand ;) one electron ? What does that mean ? I thought there are billions of them...,10/2/2022 19:51
738,1352," i thought so as well, maybe the theory is we are all super small?",12/17/1974 8:00
738,738, Hey ;) there is nothing small about me man ;) lol,1/17/2009 2:21
738,738," I got you haha. what do you think abuot celebrities? judge judy makes 123,000 per episode apparently!",4/8/1970 19:40
738,1352," That's really a lot... I mean I like her, but I remember when I was much younger, I thought she is not a real judge... that it's just a show :)",1/16/2014 11:42
738,1352, She makes the second most of any celebrity other than lebron James actually!,12/11/1997 14:30
738,738," Oh, You're a fan ? ;)",5/6/1983 10:18
738,1352," I think he is a great player, but I love Dirk Nowitzki a lot more",2/16/2016 9:24
738,1352, I don't think I know him... what team is he playing in ?,12/24/1994 9:08
738,1352," he is on the mavericks! i read that pixar has a secret room for celebrities, that is pretty cool!",12/7/2014 22:22
738,1352, They do work with a lot of celebrities so I guess that makes sense. I always liked Pixar - beautiful graphics and great sense of humor ;),12/28/1987 20:45
739,739," they really do make some great and wholesome movies, i liked alladdin with robin williams!",6/18/1973 1:45
739,1525," That was done by Pixar ? I don't think so, but I might be mistaking...",6/11/1990 6:39
739,1525," it may have just been disney, they work so closely it gets confusing",9/1/1976 20:19
739,739, Do you watch Game of Thrones?,9/3/2017 17:43
739,1525," Hi, I have never seen it. What about you?",9/24/1973 12:55
739,739, Are you kidding? its like the best show ever you should really watch it it has about 8 seasons,12/10/1986 13:30
739,1525, Haha I've been wanting to watch it. I saw Harry Lloyd is the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens.,4/29/1989 9:10
739,1525," You should watch it, and yeah the show has a great casting, its based on the novels by George R.R Martin, his a great writer.  ",9/15/1978 9:41
739,739, Very cool. I saw Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talisa.,1/22/2015 3:44
739,1525," Yeah she is one of the main characters of the show, I feel sad because the eight season is the final one so in April the beggining of the end will happen. ",2/19/2008 5:47
740,1200, Oh wow that is sad. I saw there is a Nat Geo show called Game of Lions that follows a pack of lions around.,9/11/1997 6:33
740,1200," That show must be really good, I wonder if they named the show after Game of Thrones. ",12/10/2007 8:33
740,1200, I think so. Do you know much about the universe?,7/23/1980 21:46
740,1200," I love reading about the universe its one of my passions, what about yourself? ",12/20/1991 12:04
740,740, I feel the same way. There are scientists who think the universes evolve through natural selection like species here on Earth. ,8/8/1975 15:48
740,740," That is an interesting theory, they might be on to something, there is also a theory that states that the universe is one giant super hologram.",3/9/2007 4:22
740,1200, Interesting...a giant hologram! I saw there are stars cold enough to be touched by human hands.,6/22/1989 10:14
740,740," That is also a cool fact, then there's also the theory that there's only one electron in the universe.",8/15/2008 8:12
740,1200, That is a very interesting theory. Do you follow celebrities?,3/13/1989 6:42
740,740," I do follow them, many of them make lots of money I kind of envy that",6/18/1990 1:48
741,741, Me too. Pixar has a secret room often visited by celebrities.,3/2/1988 18:32
741,238," It does? I wonder who has been there before, maybe Robin Williams before he past away. ",6/10/1991 10:45
741,238, Possibly. He was the voice of the Genie in the Aladdin movie.,9/22/1975 17:13
741,741," Yeah he was the voice of Aladdin in animated films and left a big legacy behind as he started this trend of celebrity voices of animated films, anyway its been great chatting. ",10/18/2015 8:31
741,238, Such a shame he passed away. Good chatting with you too. Take care!,7/14/2005 14:48
741,238, did you know that Tom Cruise spent ten million dollars to make a bunker that protects him from aliens lol,2/22/2009 0:03
741,238," I did not, I wonder if it was from the star that flickers some people think it is aliens!",7/11/2005 2:21
741,238," that would be scary! according to the xfiles, aliens would colonize earth in 2012, at least that never came to pass!",1/18/1978 4:33
741,741," Thankfully, They named it Tabby's star!",10/12/1988 19:35
741,741," ah interesting, I guess the alien figures from the Aliens movies were based on sea creatures from deep in Earth's ocean",1/9/1998 6:28
742,742," Wow, That star has its own subreddit.",3/1/2008 10:50
742,742," that is weird, did you know that it might be aliens, Astronomers have discovered a system that is 455 light years away with the building blocks of life?",7/19/1980 7:07
742,742," I believe it the universe is huge, earth is also 4.5 billion years old.",2/6/2011 20:21
742,1331," that is crazy, I didn't know that uranus rolls around sideways in its orbit instead of just spinning like Earth does",10/26/1991 11:26
742,1331," Interesting, What is kind of sad is that 80 percent of earths forests have been destroyed.",1/4/1992 15:17
742,1331," yes that is sad, also crazy that when the earth was made a day was only about 6 hours long, thats a super fast day!",8/31/2014 21:02
742,1331," Wow, also interesting is the core is molten lava but the caps are ice!",8/24/1972 13:54
742,1331," ya that is interesting, it's scary to me that we wilsl run out of helium by the end of this century, I know that it's very important for manufacturing electronics",2/7/1995 16:10
742,742," That cant be good, hopefully they invent a way to create it.",3/3/1979 10:55
742,742," yes I agree, crazy that we will run out of helium but humans have only been on this planet for about a minute if you count the planet's history as a 24 hour day",11/1/1979 15:50
743,743, That is not very long at all! There is a planet where it rains glass!,5/27/1992 23:59
743,743," ha that would be wild to see! I wondder if that planet has aliens? I guess firefighters are trained on how to treat aliens in case they ever visit, which seems like a waste of time haha",3/17/1981 21:39
743,806," I guess better safe than sorry, Jupiter's moon would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.",7/20/1999 14:07
743,743," that is crazy, also with venus, I don't know if you know, but it has no seasons and is the only planet to spin clock wise, the rest spin counter clockwise",6/18/1978 5:27
743,806," I did not know that, The name of Jupiter's moon is Ganymede, kind of odd huh?",4/16/2009 15:58
743,743," that is very odd, I don't know who dreamed that up but I would have come up with a better name myself!",7/31/2009 13:15
743,743, Earth is the third planet from the sun and it is the only planet to have water in liquid form.,11/23/2012 7:31
743,743," Yeah and Earth's surface is covered by about 71% water, mostly oceans.",10/4/1997 8:08
743,743, Only 3% water is fresh water which is used for drinking. Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun.,11/1/1977 22:22
743,806, Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy!,3/9/2002 9:37
744,744, The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes. If day in one part of the earth may be other part of earth have night.,5/5/1996 4:43
744,1411," Earth's axis is tilted with respect to it's orbital plane, producing seasons. Thank goodness for seasons. My favorite is Spring!",1/22/1991 21:50
744,744, The layer of the lithosphere is the upper most layer. Almost 71% of earth surface is covered with water remaining 29% is of water. The polar region are covered with snow or ice.,8/7/2021 17:28
744,1411, Hm. The planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spinning like other planets!,6/15/2001 12:53
744,1411, Very interesting. Already 80% of forest area in the world has been destroyed which results in global warming and climate changes and affects the green houses of the environment. Lot of pollution also.,5/24/2020 6:46
744,744," Yeah, sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that, including massive deforestation for many reasons. ",6/30/1987 0:18
744,1411," Planet is a term that has been used since ancient times in the context of history, astrology, science, mythology and religion. There are five planets visible to naked eyes in the solar system.",8/29/2021 8:30
744,744," Yep, I've seen all of the naked eye planets. Have you?",9/28/1994 19:55
744,744," Yes, Venus rises before the sun, so early that it is called the morning star.",4/24/1988 7:28
744,1411, Ah yes! Have you ever seen Jupiter or Saturn with just your eyes?,2/3/1992 6:34
745,1844, It is small planet we can see them with the help of telescope. ,9/27/1998 7:46
745,1844, Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. It's so big!,4/16/1995 23:29
745,1844, Jupiter is the only planet which largest amount of artfical satellite.,12/18/1983 3:43
745,1844," I think Earth is the planet with the largest amount of artificial satellites. Jupiter likely has the largest natural satellites, which we call moons.",12/9/2010 16:56
745,1844, Earth has only one natural satellite is moon.,1/3/1998 0:46
745,1844," Yes that's true. Sometimes the moon is called Luna. The moon is responsible for making the earth's tides, via the tidal bulge of the planet. ",5/6/1987 15:51
745,1844, It is very interesting news.,9/28/2021 12:00
745,1844, It was nice talking to you! Goodbye! :),12/24/2000 15:39
745,745, Do you truly believe aliens exist?,4/14/1985 14:31
745,1844, Yes I do.  I don't think we are all alone in this universe.  What do you think?,12/4/1974 14:11
746,1261, To be honest it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we don't even know about in the ocean. Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist,8/23/2010 16:45
746,746," I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them.",8/30/2005 9:12
746,1261, But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains,9/12/2013 15:16
746,1261," I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us.",11/19/1988 6:29
746,1261," Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them",8/4/2020 21:55
746,746," I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world.",9/2/1980 3:10
746,746, So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from?,9/5/1989 2:01
746,746," The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ideas.  It's just a matter of time, but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then. Lol",2/21/1978 18:31
746,746, We're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh,4/5/2007 4:33
746,746," I'll have to check it out, for sure.  On a side note, I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth. Wonder why?",10/21/2013 5:43
747,747, Might have something to do with magnetic fields we need to get neil degrasse tyson on the case he'll figure it out,9/28/1972 0:55
747,541," Lol, I'm just wondering, will I be lighter on my feet there?  And will the weight of the world not feel like its on my shoulders?  Asking for a friend.",7/10/1993 17:01
747,747, LOL these are the real questions the people want to know,6/6/2005 23:43
747,747, Exactly!  I read that Jupiter saves the Earth from getting hit by so many asteroids.  That's very nice of it.,8/2/2019 23:15
747,747, Poor jupiter its basically a giant shield for our great ball of water,7/1/2017 9:04
747,541, True and poor old Pluto lost its designation as a planet!  Wow!,1/25/2015 22:51
747,541, Pluto will always be a planet in my heart lol they can't just suddenly change something like that,1/8/2018 21:49
747,541," That's how I feel too, about little ole Pluto.  I feel like the bullies are picking on him and I need to stand up and defend the little guy.  ",5/11/1985 6:50
747,541, Listen Pluto will always be a planet there's probably support groups for this kind of thing lol,1/8/2016 10:49
747,541," I hear ya!  Well, it's been fun chatting with you, friend.  I bid you good night.",8/6/1982 7:10
748,748, Have an awesome night go watch alex jones and joe rogan real quick on youtube and have a laugh,4/2/2017 7:40
748,748," Ok, will do!",4/10/2012 6:40
748,748," Hi, how are you?",8/27/2017 5:46
748,748," Great, how are you?",11/19/1993 5:36
748,748, I am well. Do you believe in aliens?,6/4/1989 4:43
748,43," The one's from space? Not likely to have happened, though there is life on other planets. What about you?",5/24/1984 4:24
748,43, Not really. I am not even remotely interested in space so I usually ignore that stuff. X-files on the other hand...,9/10/2013 0:37
748,43, The aliens missed their colonization date. Why so close to Christmas? I guess the winter solstice is a good date.,9/19/1971 8:06
748,43, What a bunch of downers. At least we have will smith to protect us!,1/26/1985 19:13
748,748, Did you know that over 80 percent of the Earth's forests have already been destroyed? Maybe the aliens will be appalled at the destruction and leave.,6/27/2014 1:00
749,136, Or our level of stupidity and move on so we don't ruin their planet. ,1/30/1991 8:23
749,749," In September 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they make contact with us. I wonder how you quality for THAT job. Seems like there would be little to do.",7/27/1996 14:51
749,136, Yeah. I am not sure that's a full-time job. Any aliens today? No. See you tomorrow!,6/25/1991 0:04
749,136, There seems to be more pressing problems. Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will we get helium for our balloons? Maybe the aliens will bring some for us. ,7/15/2019 14:47
749,749," Can helium be created in a lab? On a personal note, I have two helium balloons stuck in my vaulted ceiling. That helium lasts for at least 3 weeks. It is getting tiresome.]",5/23/1998 6:18
749,136," In 2007 Tom Cruise spent millions on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Maybe he knows some of the firefighters trained in treating aliens, in the event of a UFO crash. Or maybe he has a secret helium source.",11/30/1970 17:49
749,136," As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker, I am fine with it. He seems a little weird...",2/25/1981 2:30
749,749," Speaking of weird, the world's longest name is a story about a shepherd protecting his sheep and humanity from aliens. Who has this name, and why? Are the parents X-files fans?",8/5/1984 0:20
749,136, Aliens were based of creatures found in the ocean? I feel like there is a lot in the ocean we do not know about.,11/21/2003 17:20
749,749," We haven't been around very long. If Earth's history were viewed as a 24 hour period, we would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds. ",11/2/1988 4:53
750,750," You're right, that's not long at all!",7/13/1984 20:03
750,750," When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. By the time the aliens show up, the day will be 40 hours long and the work day will be 20 hours. The alien overlords won't pay us overtime either.  Well, I enjoyed chatting!",7/4/1972 9:33
750,750, Me too!,9/30/2018 17:57
750,238," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",3/5/1991 7:01
750,750," I'm doing well, how are you? ",1/25/2016 16:11
750,750, I'm great! Are you knowledgeable of the sport known as baseball?,3/5/2006 12:50
750,750," Yeah, I used to play when I was younger. Did you know a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth? ",3/28/1977 5:54
750,238, That sounds unfair! She should have been hired on the spot! fans would pay to see that!,1/23/1988 18:21
750,750," Hilarious, did you know the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat? ",1/21/1977 1:29
750,750, How often does that happen? Has an umpire ever really done that? I have questions.,6/20/1996 11:15
751,751," I'm not sure, it doesn't seem like a real rule does it? ",5/11/2013 2:41
751,1623, It sounds bogus. Three bases? I've never heard of that. Somebody check the rule book! Giamatti would not accept that rule.,11/14/1971 17:42
751,751," Yeah, some of the stuff you read isn't always true. Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series. ",9/26/2005 4:58
751,751," The Cubbies, a sad story. How could they put on such a losing streak? They signed a deal with the devil to win back to back, and then never win again.",3/6/2002 8:35
751,1623," Well they won recently didn't they? I think in 2014 or maybe it was 16, it slips my memory. ",2/7/1984 0:53
751,751," Did they? Did they break the curse? I didn't know that. I figured they had made their deal, but now I guess they made a new deal with the devil. Why do managers wear uniforms now?",9/17/2005 22:41
751,751," I believe they did. BTW, do you watch the show Game of Thrones? ",9/24/1994 2:01
751,751," I've heard of it. HBO, right? Some guy wrote some books, but takes forever to get new stuff done, yeah?",4/24/2010 2:16
751,751," It is on HBO, anyways, one of the actors who is real big and looks old in the show is actually only 25 years old. ",2/10/1999 10:26
751,751," Hm.That sounds odd. I know that they shoot all around the world, which is a really cool thing.",5/7/1988 23:39
752,326, Did you know the Dodgers have lost more World Series than any other team. ,6/23/2009 20:05
752,752, That is a saddening statisic. How much the fans must deplore that record.,1/5/1997 3:33
752,752," Yeah, it is pretty bad. Have you ever seen them play? ",4/11/1998 7:08
752,752, I have never seen the Dodgers but I expect that LA must have money because of the many fans. ,1/27/1979 9:06
752,326, I've been to the Stadium before. It is not that great. Nice chatting with you. ,2/11/1995 20:55
752,752, Well...howdy! What about baseball and the World Series? ,2/15/2000 12:38
752,752, I'm a fan. Are you a fan of baseball? ,6/15/2005 0:42
752,752," Well, I'm not an Astros fan, I'm a Cleveland Indians fan. How about you? What baseball city you like?",6/7/2009 19:35
752,326, I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade. ,12/20/1979 18:21
752,752, I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him?,1/10/1980 6:49
753,753," I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play? ",12/21/1974 11:39
753,62, I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt.,4/26/2012 16:30
753,62," Yeah. The Nationals have Bryce Harper, he had a bad year last year, but he is still very highly paid. ",10/23/1981 16:53
753,62," Very true. I was rooting for the Nationals last year, but man they hit the wall late in the baseball season. What happened?",10/30/2000 6:06
753,753," It happens all the time. Crazy, they just can't close the deal. ",9/16/1977 4:29
753,753, That sounds an awful like the Indians. I'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series. I'm beginning to think I never will.,2/2/1976 14:59
753,62," Crazy. Well, they were in the movie Major League. ",10/4/2005 8:51
753,753, LOL....yep...and with Charlie Sheen playing for them in that. Sheesh. Hey maybe the Nationals and the Tribe will play in the world series this year....ya never know?,4/1/1983 12:37
753,62, That would be cool. Did you know that up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all of the games for the year? ,6/25/1979 12:20
753,753, I've never heard that before! I wondered what happened after 2005? Did that married couple get divorced for arguing baseball games...lol,10/5/2010 22:51
754,1423," I'm not sure, they probably moved to some sort of automated system. ",9/30/1999 20:27
754,1423," Well, that would explain why the Indians play so many silly early baseball games in wintery Cleveland in the early season. Computers must not know weather.",11/18/1980 4:42
754,754, Very true. Did you know somebody found $3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?,8/21/1973 23:19
754,754," I read that! Wonder what they did with the money? Oh....and I do watch Game Of Thrones sometimes, I'm up to Season 5.",10/5/2010 7:12
754,754," I used to, I stopped at Series 4. I hear they get a subsidy from Ireland. ",4/17/2022 15:06
754,1423," That's news to me...I'm not a huge fan of Game of Thrones, can't understand them when they talk.",3/24/1983 23:48
754,1423," Yeah, it is ok. Well nice chatting with you. ",6/14/1970 6:05
754,1423," Hello, do you watch baseball>",6/6/2021 2:56
754,1423, I am a fan of baseball - I used to know the married couple who scheduled all 2430 baseball games every year,9/19/2001 15:39
754,754," Wow, I guess those are the people that you can call mega fans. I am not the biggest baseball fan although I do go to a few games each year",9/20/2002 16:04
755,755, Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprised to find that it is our national game,10/14/1999 4:30
755,755, I would be surprised too. Kickball is known as soccer-baseball in Canada. That is odd.,8/6/1979 20:28
755,263," Yes.  I have had a few baseball cards in my day, but one lucky man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards!",6/4/2022 10:52
755,755, 3 million is probably more money that I will ever have. The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood. I do no think that those rocks will ever be worth 3 million!,6/3/2002 21:27
755,755, laugh for sure!  Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play!,1/22/1995 4:31
755,263, Really ? Although I do not think any of them have ever stepped in. I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches. ,10/7/1993 21:41
755,263, No doubt but it would be fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game,3/11/2013 13:54
755,755," Speaking of the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series!",5/16/2002 9:46
755,755, That was until a few years ago!  That was a great year.  The curse of the goat!,12/21/2009 8:27
755,755, What is the curse of the goat? Is it some kind of superstition?,3/15/1993 15:23
756,1975, The Cubs did not let a man bring his goat into a baseball game around 1918 and he put a curse on them.  It lasted almost a hundred years!,3/22/1974 3:20
756,1975," Ah, thank you. Speaking of the cubs, they were the very first team to win the world series back to back and they have not won since!",7/7/1979 21:28
756,1975, Yes - even famous players can blow it sometimes too - Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 and it caused his team to lose the 1926 world series,8/31/1973 1:37
756,1975, Really? I though Babe Ruth was a renowned baseball player. I wonder why he would steal.,5/7/1974 12:05
756,1975, Yes he was a big hitter but sometimes you need to steal a base!  He was a big guy though so probably not that fast,7/16/1983 8:58
756,756, Probably. Do you watch Game of Thrones?,10/7/1985 5:44
756,1975, I have never seen it but I have heard a lot about it.  It has received 47 emmy awards so it must be pretty good,1/1/2015 20:45
756,1975, 47? That is a lot. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter played Talisa in Game of Thrones!,8/7/1982 5:16
756,1975, I had never heard that - I knew Peter Dinklage won several Emmys for the show.,6/26/1982 18:28
756,1975, hey what search engine do you use? Is it google?,11/6/2012 18:51
757,757," Hello, how are you? Yes I use Google predominantly, unless I am looking for videos or music. What about you?",9/29/1973 6:19
757,757," Well Actually I use Bing because they pay you for every search, but it's crazy that Google Maps can tell how congested traffic is by how fast android phones are movie",7/14/1973 13:59
757,757, I know right. Or the fact that one of Google's search requires more power than it did to send Neil Armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon.,1/5/2008 13:28
757,757, ya that is crazy! I do like that they're a green company and one time used goats to mow their lawn haha,12/9/1987 21:28
757,757," Yes, goats are very effective.  Talking about google. Google uses andriod devices moments to calculate traffic ",11/10/1982 17:26
757,757," ya they do, they also are a huge part of internet traffic, when they were down for about 5 mins they took out 40 percent of total web traffic1",2/5/2020 12:09
757,426, interesting..google tailors its maps around disputed borders based on where the browser is located ,5/23/2019 16:38
757,757," haha that makes sense, do you use Spotify? I only use youtube myself",2/6/2001 22:58
757,757," I use them all, Pandora, You Tube and Spotify. The all have there different  purposes. Spotify has so many songs that 20% of them have never been played.",10/11/2006 23:40
757,426," ya that is crazy, that's about 4 million songs, I guess a musician woul dneed their song played 130,000 times in order to earn minimum wage ",5/14/1984 12:34
758,1847," Yes per day, that is crazy. A band earned $20,000 from spotify for a silent album.",8/17/2011 20:19
758,758," haha that is genius, I guess the guy behind spotify is also the guy who created utorrent which is something I use",2/16/2020 13:09
758,1847, I use spotify when I just want something playing in the background or to listen to a whole CD. But when I want to watch the videos I switch to YouTube. Did you know YouTube is the second largest search engine.,10/2/1992 18:45
758,758," I didn't but that makes sense, have you checkout out the police version of youtube, blutube?",3/12/1984 9:50
758,758," I have heard of it but now seen it. I just can't believe the amount of content, in 2017 there were 400 hours of content uploaded every minute, so crazy.",5/1/1983 13:40
758,758," that is crazy, also I remember when Gangnam Style came out and Youtube had to upgrade itself to handle the traffic",5/14/1997 9:06
758,1847, I remember that too. Do you know what the most disliked video on YouTube?,6/2/2004 15:19
758,1847," I think it's Baby by Justin bieber, I personally don't think its that bad what about you? LIke it is catchy haha",10/14/1974 17:36
758,758," It is annoyingly catchy, people are just being haters. There are plenty of other awful things I am sure, just not as popular. Have tried their paid music streaming, have you?",9/17/1991 19:01
758,758," no I have never paid for streaming music, I just use youtube, but I am on a google music trial right now, what about you?",2/5/2008 0:12
759,759," I have not paid for anything either, just Netflix. ",5/14/2007 1:27
759,1710, yeah netflix and youtube make up half of internet traffic os it is very likely lots of people use it!,3/22/2003 4:45
759,1710," Game of Thrones seems like one of the most popular TV shows...and it has been for a few years, too, right?",4/10/1984 22:03
759,759, Yeah about 5 or 6 years now.  You dont watch it?,7/1/2003 19:31
759,759," No, but I really want to. I haven't even bought cable TV. I have watched Game of Thrones at friends' houses, though.",12/6/1995 15:51
759,1710," Oh thats good,  you should catch up the last season is coming out in april and thats it the show will be done. ",2/28/1991 16:17
759,1710, I really need to catch up on it. I also have no idea what's going on this year with the World Series Baseball.,3/23/2016 18:52
759,759, The actress that plays Arya actually has never been in anything before.  what a break!  First time acting and gets Game of Thrones!,10/8/1973 4:36
759,759, Is Arya the one that has all the gorgeous fierce dragons on Game of Thrones?,7/12/1998 21:20
759,759," No.  Arya is the little girl,  she looks like a boy,  on purpose. ",12/25/2011 1:38
760,760, I heard that Ireland finances the Game of Throne series because it's filmed there and they get a good boost of tourism through that. Sounds good to me!,11/13/1989 3:19
760,1764," Yes, My aunt and cousin went to visit it last summer,  the pics were amazing!",5/19/1987 5:58
760,1764, Did you know that Charlie Chaplin's Granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr in the Game of Thrones? I wonder if she has many lines?,1/4/1989 22:50
760,760, I did know that but I dont recognize the name at all so I guess she is not a main character. ,4/13/2016 11:06
760,1764, Do they have other cool creatures in the Game of Thrones show besides dragons? I'd love to see unicorns and other things too!,10/9/2004 21:57
760,1764," Giant wolves that are called Direwolvles,  White walkers (like dead zombies but frozen one),  Giants.  ",7/17/2008 8:17
760,760, WOW! Sounds so cool! They have Dire Wolves in this card game called Magic the Gathering. Definitely have giants in that game too. ,9/1/2000 6:05
760,760," Oh ok,  I have heard of that game.  Its a card game?",2/20/2005 1:53
760,760, Yes. I mostly like the artwork on the cards. It's definitely better than watching the World Series baseball. I think my Grandpa used to call it the Fall Classic or something.,6/10/1995 2:38
760,1764, Thats cool.. i hardly watch the world series unless the sf giants are in it. ,9/17/1980 20:42
761,131, I think that's a baseball team doing a little better than the Cubs...I heard they haven't won the world series since the Ottoman Empire was in existence. Amazing!,6/26/2005 8:50
761,131, I think the cubs are only in existence to make everyone else feel better about their own team,6/21/2005 12:51
761,131, LOL I bet there is a group of people like that in The Game of Thrones!,3/6/2007 11:42
761,131, Hello. Would you pay 10$ a month for you tube music ?,10/6/1989 15:46
761,131," Probably not,  I dont really need it lol I just listen to pandora mostly.",5/6/2005 13:34
761,761, I would rather listen for it with ads ,8/9/2007 19:01
761,131, did you know youtube is the second largest search engine in the world?,6/18/2007 18:51
761,761, Yes I use it every day since 2005 when it was first launched ,9/26/1987 12:10
761,131," I probably use it a lot too,  I look up how-to videos,  reviews,  movie trailers,  tips,  and snowboarding videos lol ",11/29/2020 15:01
761,131, I would like to check out blutube to see the law enforcement videos,12/3/2013 2:12
762,762, Is that available to the public?,1/26/1979 3:08
762,762, I would have to check in to that. Do you like Spotify ?,7/9/2012 0:12
762,1981," I honestly have never used it,  I hear it has 4 million songs that have never been played though thats kinda sad. ",2/22/2022 14:31
762,1981, yes it is sad. but I just download all my songs from you tube for free,12/21/1992 22:50
762,762, do you use spotify at all? Did you know a band earned 20k from spotify for a silent album lol ,12/26/1997 18:42
762,762, yes but you need like 13745 plays just to make 7.25 a hour,2/3/2004 12:48
762,762," I guess it depends on how many songs they had on there then,  to make 20 k lol",5/1/1998 11:07
762,1981, Do you use google ? ,9/30/2021 8:06
762,1981, yes probably everyday lol how about u?,8/30/1982 18:26

763,355, did you know google maps calculates the traffic by how fast android phones are moving?,7/24/2013 1:18
763,763, that is very good to know. ,11/3/2002 13:10
763,763, Instead of hiring people to mow their lawn they once used hundred of goats ,1/2/1987 21:38

763,763, Thanks have a good one. ,8/25/1980 17:34
763,763, Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals,5/18/2009 7:19
763,355, I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago.,5/17/1984 0:57
763,763, Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary?,2/18/1977 11:41
764,764, That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know.,5/13/2016 3:21
764,764," Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball",10/29/1989 20:19
764,764, That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years.,2/8/2005 23:04
764,764, That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude!,11/10/1994 1:59
764,764, I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol,4/8/1997 5:57
764,1909, Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic,6/6/1974 0:36
764,764, Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US?,5/21/2022 14:25
764,764," No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL",4/11/2017 2:24
764,1909, lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol,9/7/1983 3:04
764,1909, Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic,8/27/1997 8:00
765,765, I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.,10/18/1993 14:44
765,234," Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April",5/6/2008 18:49
765,234, The next season is supposed to be the last one correct?,3/18/1977 14:29
765,765," Yes it will be the last one. It's crazy that Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is actually in Game of Thrones, I forget who she is though",9/4/2005 21:34
765,765, Wow.  I never knew that.  How neat.  I'm going to have to binge watch it and get caught up before the last season begins.  I've heard that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most like because of Game of Thrones.,8/24/1975 21:43
765,234," Haha you're right about that! And yes you should definitely check it out, they even made a knockoff series about lions called game of lions LOL",4/13/1970 9:46
765,234, That's funny!  I see that Harry Lloyd who is on there is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.  That is neat they have 2 people related to famous people from a long time ago.,8/27/2000 3:49
765,234, Yep I agree with you. There's even a guy who is the great grandson of Charles Dickens LOL they've got everyone in the show,3/22/1990 15:34
765,234, Hello do you like baseball?,11/2/1977 0:58
765,234, I do like baseball. I think it's crazy that the baseball managers can actually play the game. That's why they wear the uniforms,9/27/1992 13:45
766,957," Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol ",12/13/1992 8:05
766,766, Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada,8/25/1977 22:05
766,957, I read it but I dont remember lol ,4/12/1978 19:07
766,957," Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL",12/2/1975 18:46
766,766, maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me. ,11/16/1993 21:56
766,766, Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack,9/4/2014 21:43
766,766," i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.  ",9/15/2022 0:40
766,957, Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan?,6/7/1987 1:05
766,957, who wouldve thought!  ,12/28/2010 9:15
766,766, I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha,2/3/2019 10:22
767,767, Yeah really.  Do you watch game of thrones?,10/9/2011 1:54
767,845, I do like Game of Thrones. What about you? I can't wait for the new season to start in April,1/6/1990 20:47
767,767, seriously!!! Im re watching all of the season to prepare for it hahaha ,5/24/1985 9:11
767,767, Yep I need to do that too! I love that Peter Dinklage has won three Emmy Awards. He does a great job in that show,8/20/1992 11:38
767,845, he does a great of making us hate him lol I really love Tyrion. ,3/30/1984 13:16
767,845, Tyrion is awesome haha. It's great that the show has gotten a total of 47 Emmys as well. I even got three Hugo Awards. I just need to know how the show ends haha.,12/14/1990 7:05
767,767," yes I definitely want to see how this crazy show ends,  and I want to see what spin off they will make,  i would really like a tv show about the targaryens!",8/10/2018 3:57
767,845, Yep I think they are making spin-offs to so that will be cool. Have you ever seen the show Game of lions,3/10/2007 12:20
767,845," I have not,  its on my to do list lol I love animal shows too. ",7/19/1992 21:01
767,767, Animals are awesome! It's also crazy how many stars in Game of Thrones are related to famous stars. Let's hope that this season is good!,5/11/1984 2:06
768,1676," Hi, do you like baseball?",3/18/1977 23:07
768,1676," Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game?",12/18/2010 21:26
768,768," Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed!",11/12/2018 0:16
768,768," It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered. ",12/10/2003 5:21
768,768," Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time!",10/3/2016 9:34
768,1676," Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win.",9/19/2013 7:28
768,1676, That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic?,9/20/2011 3:31
768,1676," You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year.",4/29/1984 12:24
768,768," wow, you collected those too!  I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940's!!",6/8/2013 8:04
768,1676," Yes, I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did. You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp color guard carried the flag upside down, I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident?",7/23/2022 7:42
769,970, I would be funny if it was an accident.. You lknow? I really like hoe the world series are played.. It is not just one game..you get a seven game playoff and the excitement lasts more than other sports!,3/31/1975 12:02
769,970," Yes, that makes it fairer to the best team. You can win on a fluke shot  or play in one game (i.e. Super Bowl, NCAA Champion), but to win 4 or 7 is more skill. I am a Royals fan and they Won the World Series 4-5 years ago and then lost all their best players to free agency or like Justin Verlander leaving the Tigers and going to the Astro's. With small market teams the skill isn't always evenly distributed around the league. ",7/13/1988 19:39
769,769, Yes that is kind of sad.. and Verlander helped so much the Astros to win.. it was the right move.. for the Astros,4/13/2003 15:05
769,769," Yes, there's two sides to every story. Though small market teams don't have the draw of the Yankee's or Dodgers, you see where the Women's World Cup had higher TV  rating than the World Series in the US last year?",7/26/1991 1:18
769,769, I am a soccer fan and the womens world cup grew a lot in popularity since the last one! But I was shocked to learn that is was watched more than the world series!!,7/28/1982 10:42
769,769," So was I, speaking of fans. My wife loves Game of Thrones, we're binge watching it getting ready for the final season, do you watch it? It has some great blood lines, did you see where Charles Dickens great-great-great grandson and Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter are both actors on the HBO Series?",10/23/2011 19:36
769,970, I do not watch but I know is really really popular!! Even made the name Arya very popular in new baby girls.,1/26/2020 6:38
769,970," Yes, that crazy to me. I like the show okay, buy my wife is so enthused she'd probably name a kid after one of the shows characters (both our kids are out college, there's no risk in that). It is beautifully filmed, financed by Ireland  with some many scenes set there and Croatia, Canada,  Malta and all the other places they filmed it makes for some beautiful scenery for all the sets.",6/27/1998 2:46
769,970," LOL wow it is film in really beautiful places !!!  I probably will create a game of thrones tour and visit all those places including the sites in Spain, Scottland, Morocco!!",4/18/1973 21:34
769,970," I assure you they already have it in Ireland and soon, if not already there will be cruise lines offering Game of Thrones Themed world cruises. You don't follow the show, but the Lannister's are an evil clan ruling the throne (illegitimately some would say) for many years and Martin, the author of the book said (funny living in Boston area) the Patriots are the Lannister's of the NFL which I think isn't a totally false and funny analogy.",8/13/2009 15:22
770,770, LOL!! I will probably watch Game of Lions!! You know I have enjoyed this chat very much!! Cool facts about baseball history!,3/11/2005 18:40
770,770," Yes, I enjoyed the wide ranging discussion too. Have a great remainder of your week.",12/8/2009 19:19
770,164, Do you like baseball?,8/17/2015 20:38
770,770," Yeah, I'm a Royals fan. I thought it funny that managers wear unis because they can play. ",10/6/1999 1:14
770,164," Yeah, I never thought that was possible, I think the whole team has to get injured first though",8/2/2010 23:36
770,770, Can you imagine someone like Tommy Lasorda playing.  It would be like Babe Ruth getting caught stealing in the 1926 World Series. ,6/1/1986 1:01
770,770," Yeah I can imagine the scenario, Babe Ruth sure was  a great player, too bad his team lost that game back in 1926",12/7/2012 0:02
770,164," Yep.  Funny, kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada. ",7/30/2008 22:56
770,164," I see, so do you like to watch series? have you watched Game of Thrones before?",3/28/1998 9:26
770,164," Yes and yes... I love GoT, it's a guilty pleasure of mine.  I was surprised to learn that Harry Lloyd was a relative of Charles Dickens.  Love Charles Dickens...",2/25/2012 3:26
771,771," That is a suprising fact are they really related? guess theres no doubt where his talent comes from, you know the series are financed in part by Ireland",5/21/2002 5:27
771,771, I heard that.  There are more famous connections too.  Talisa is the granddaughter of Talisa.  Wow.  ,5/16/1975 12:43
771,771," I wonder if they knew these facts when they casted the actors of the show, it seems like there's a lot of interesting facts behind the series",9/28/1981 1:01
771,771," I'm sure they let it slip out during the casting.  GoT now has spin offs, a Nat'l Geo show called Game of Lions where lions are like GoT characters. ",3/15/2021 15:38
771,771," Havent seen that one but sounds like an interesting show for sure, Game of Lions, I wonder how its similar to the series",3/11/2015 4:54
771,771, I can't imagine costuming lions like that.  Can you believe the women's World Cup had better ratings than the World Series in the U.S.?,6/13/2001 4:38
771,98," It did? maybe because the womens team is pretty good, they always land in a good spot, still, its surprising as baseball is one of the most popular games in America",12/5/2010 0:53
771,771," Yeah, I guess baseball is so popular in Japan that they were surprised to find out it's America's national pastime. ",4/13/1981 12:14
771,98," Yes Japan has a lot of fans indeed, do you know who the Chicago Cubs are?",10/20/1988 18:55
771,771," Yeah, until they won in 2016, the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won the World Series. ",7/28/1981 19:48
772,22," I heard they had a big drought before that, its strange how the team was the first to win the series back to back",1/29/2002 11:26
772,22, It was long for sure.  I was glad to see them beat the Indians in 2016.  It was like that had a curse or something like in GoT.  ,9/15/2010 1:11
772,772," Yeah it sure seemed that way, its a good thing the curse got lift.",12/21/2020 23:45
772,772," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",7/30/1998 15:11
772,22," Hi, I'm trying to learn what the word accoutrements means, do you have any idea?",6/11/1988 8:38
772,22, What are you learning that word for?,2/27/2019 1:49
772,22," Well, it's a new tactic that video game companies are tyring to employ to entice gamers.",5/19/2001 8:58
772,22," Oh, you mean you need to buy extra and accessories in order to enjoy the game fully? Pretty sneaky. ",1/8/2013 13:12
772,772," I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation?",1/26/2005 12:11
772,22, I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest. Do you like to play?,7/31/1976 0:50
773,598," No, but the US department of defense used over a thousand of those consoles to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative! That sounds like massive processing power!",7/11/1993 8:44
773,773, That's a smart way to go. Scale up simple units to get the power. I don't really know the PS. Aren't they up to PS4 or something?,2/23/2017 12:30
773,598," Not sure since I don't play as well either, all I know is that it is created and owned by Sony who launched it in Japan. They were so popular and successful that they've sold at least over 100 million units! Wonder what X-box's numbers are.",6/17/1980 23:29
773,773, Sony has made a great platform. Are the games good? Usually that drives the sales of the machine. Are the games on all the platforms now?,4/15/1982 3:48
773,598," Not sure since those consoles can be used for research purposes, like researchers are using them to research black holes, maybe they are not only used for games.",10/9/1991 15:29
773,773, I did hear that the military used the controllers for training troops on equipment. Very intuitive. They learned fast. I don't know why black holes for research though. Why not regular computers?,3/15/2009 22:47
773,773, Probably since it was cheaper like the supercomputer they built out of the consoles. I wonder if I went on YouTube whether or not I could learn how to build a supercomputer as well. Do you use YouTube?,12/9/2020 10:13
773,773," That's true. Cheaper. I sometimes use Youtube, usually for music.",2/24/1995 21:37
773,773, I do the same for those purposes as well and for DIY videos which I think is a large reason why its the second largest search engine on the net!,10/16/1998 14:55
773,773," DIY videos? Sounds interesting. Why is Justin Bieber's baby is the most disliked video on youtube? Why the hate? I don't like the guy, but what's the point?",11/9/2004 3:54
774,1789," Yeah exactly, like Facebook, they should probably take away that dislike button and spread a little bit more positivity! Unless it's because his die-hard fans are sad that he isn't a Baby anymore. fans do get crazy sometimes.",1/21/2017 1:40
774,1789, I'm not really up to speed on the new music. I guess I'm getting old. I use Youtube to find my favorites from the old days.,11/11/1971 9:06
774,1789," Not only do they have songs, they even have music videos, backstage access, audio recordings, etc. so you can find them all on there, even the oldies but goodies!",6/30/1994 0:18
774,774," That's great! Police actually have their own youtube called blutube, where they share law enforcement videos. I wonder if there are any secrets there that would be good to know. How to get out of a ticket.",4/10/2010 13:44
774,774," I wonder if there were videos whether or not they'd actually work. Great chat, have a nice day!",7/24/1987 0:55
774,1789," Hello, do you happen to have a pet?",7/24/2000 21:00
774,774," No, I don't own a pet. I do like dogs, though. Do you own a pet?",6/8/1998 15:44
774,1789," I have a dog, its interesting how there about 12 different blood types, my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact.",10/30/2007 5:34
774,1789, I've heard that there are dog blood drives. I guess the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg. ,9/18/2016 6:12
774,774," I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company.",6/29/1975 8:24
775,65, It's probably easier to manage dogs in an office space. Cats won't stay put. ,3/18/1998 8:25
775,65," I agree but cats spend like 66% of their lives sleeping, when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping.",1/17/1991 12:12
775,775," When they're asleep, they're easy to manage. Once they're awake, they wander and explore. Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet. Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles.",11/6/1984 16:51
775,775," I wonder if thats an effective system, I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for sure.",12/22/1974 10:17
775,775, I've never been to a cat cafe. There are many of them in Japan and Taiwan. I guess the cats get along with each other and don't have a problem with people trying to pet them.,4/27/1978 7:14
775,65," Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries, there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book.",2/11/1990 4:59
775,775," I think he wanted to use the word we in the paper, so he included his cat as an author. I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town.",12/31/1982 18:42
775,775," I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.",6/20/2019 18:53
775,65," A cat couldn't really do much harm. Sleeps most of the time. Rest of the time they hunt. Cats have eliminated the bird species of specific areas, even caused extinction.",1/1/1978 7:29
775,65," They have? wow that is suprising, you know the cat in godfather 1 was actually a strayed one.",3/27/2006 22:18
776,1955, It was a pretty well-behaved cat. I don't think cats will ever be called  man's best friend but they sure come close.,10/15/1991 0:53
776,1955," I dont think that either, you know dogs are actually not color blind, they can also see colors but not in the way we do.",6/20/1995 13:58
776,1955," I'm not surprised. I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.",11/28/1970 6:22
776,1955," I see, I didnt know cats could also see colors that is surprising to me!",6/2/1983 23:57
776,1955, Cats probably also have many different blood types. I wonder whether they have blood drives the same as for dogs.,8/16/2006 9:30
776,1955," I bet there are, I mean there are a lot of people who love cats so its really probable.",7/21/1987 4:02
776,776, I was reading that Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provides comfort when they are playing. I never knew that and found it interesting. ,1/10/2021 20:16
776,1955," That is interesting, so they started it for comfort over style then. ",7/15/1998 16:22
776,776, I guess. I once had a neighbor who was into jazz and would play. He was pretty good. A harlem woman has free concerts at her apartment for the past 20 years and sometimes top performers will stop over. What fun!,5/21/1999 5:35
776,1955," That would be fun, and its sounds like her neighbors all like it if it's been happening for 20 years!",8/11/2020 4:01
777,777, Did you know that Wayne Rooney is considering signing with DC United,5/2/2003 21:05
777,1267," Yeah I think he did sign with them actually, this must be a bit dated.  I think that is the new norm now with stars coming to the US to end their careers. ",11/11/2011 3:54
777,777, I understand he is not the only one to come to the US. He did sign that is interesting. Do you follow sports much. I do not which is why I had not known. ,3/14/2017 22:10
777,1267, I do follow sports so that is why I knew.  I am a big fan of english league football actually. ,6/23/2013 10:04
777,1267, That is wonderful! So DC United is a team in the US. Is the game played the same here in the US and in England? ,5/22/2008 3:03
777,777, Yeah they are an MLS which is the American soccer league.  The game is played the same way but we have a playoffs here instead of top of table wins the league. ,10/9/2008 6:58
777,1267," I think that soccer is a great sport and while I do not follow, I think it is a lot better than american football is. I would imagine that he is a good player as they did want him badly. ",11/3/2000 1:48
777,777," Yeah he is a good player and I think he has been doing good for them so far.  And I agree, and I think american football is far more dangerous a sport to play. ",7/18/1998 9:37
777,1267, It certainly is. Soccer is such a popular sport all around the world. I guess a player named Mesut Ozil donated his earnings from a bonus in the World Cup to pay for 23 children in Brazil to have surgeries. What a nice thing to do. ,3/23/1995 16:08
777,777," I read that, I think that is such a cool thing to do.  I know he has been in a tough situation with his national team as of late as well. ",4/7/1978 6:40
778,1686, That is too bad for him. Hopefully things turn around. I always wondered why americans call it soccer and I read that is because it was the slang for Association Football. Such a simple reason.,7/14/2010 23:43
778,1686," Yeah I guess it started as a slang term and just caught on for some reason here, I think its stupid that we named american football, football, because most of it is played with our hands!",10/20/1976 2:19
778,1686," Ha, ha, I always wondered that as well. It does not make any sense. Honestly I am surprised that soccer is not more popular here in the US Did you read that there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams play at the same time. That must be crazy. ",2/3/1991 4:38
778,778," Yeah I think I heard about that one time.  I think people here think its too boring because of the score, but it really is the most exciting.  And then I think that they think they need to come up with new games or ways to play to make it more exciting. ",5/28/1970 23:17
778,778, Yes that might be so. Reading about hats and I see birthday hats were derived from dunce hats to encourage foolish behaviour at parties. ,12/20/1982 7:37
778,1686, That is pretty interesting.  Did you know the same type of plastic they make legos with is used to make hard hats?,2/20/2021 12:35
778,778," Wow, I never knew that. Funny that they limited hat pins to a certain length, afraid women would use them as weapons. ",9/5/1972 13:49
778,778," Yeah that is funny!  Well its been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",2/16/2010 6:31
778,1686, Good morning! Do you like dogs?,3/29/1983 13:47
778,778," I do, I have a dog at home and a cat. How about you?",7/20/1974 14:19
779,779," I love dogs. I have one as well, and it's so smart it can understand pointing. I guess dogs and elephants can do that.",8/7/1981 13:24
779,779," Yeah they are smart. Did you know that they are not color blind, but they can't see as many different colors as humans?",10/2/1974 15:02
779,781," I didn't know that, but that's cool. Did you know google prefers dogs to cats?",9/26/1981 6:24
779,779, I've heard that their code of conduct specifically states that. That's pretty cool!,11/8/2007 15:51
779,781," Speaking of cats, when a cat reaches 15, they've spent 10 of it sleeping. Must be nice!",12/11/1989 16:20
779,779, That's funny. Did you know there's a town in Alaska has had a cat as its mayor since 1997. ,1/25/1973 19:10
779,779," They have my vote! Cats are famous sometimes, even one from the Godfather part 1 that was a stray on set!",9/26/2020 17:05
779,779, Did you know there's cat cafe's in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks. I wonder if that would go over well here.,6/26/2000 5:34
779,781," I think it would with dogs, since they perform many roles for humans!",8/11/2015 5:27
779,779, I didn't know that they have 12 different blood types. ,12/21/1996 0:43
780,559, Me neither! They also have dog blood drives for them to donate to!,12/16/2013 14:57
780,559, I need to take my dog to one. I give blood all the time so he should too. ,7/7/2008 7:23
780,559, I'm sure he would save many dog's lives! I wish I lived in Hawaii as far as business attire goes!,12/19/2004 10:12
780,559, I'd like wearing an Aloha shirt instead of my uniform. I dress pretty much like Billy Mays' pallbearers. Blue shirt and khaki pants. ,6/5/2021 20:50
780,780, That is one nice style you have there! I wear polo shirts but didn't know they were invented for tennis players!,1/20/2014 17:06
780,559, I never knew that either. They were invented by Rene The Crocodile Lacoste.,3/24/2014 18:58
780,559," What a nickname! I can see why it was later adopted by polo players, hence the name!",7/20/2000 9:52
780,559," Yeah I can see that too. In China during the cultural revolution, gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their color. That's a fashion that I'm glad died. ",3/8/2015 6:35
780,559," I am too. I always laughed at those people. Well it was nice chatting with you, have a great day!",4/5/1994 21:46
780,559, Hi do you like cats? They are definitely good at hunting vermin!,7/18/1990 5:15
781,781, Agreed. I do love cats as well as most pets! Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool!,3/15/1990 5:38
781,781, Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping!,7/29/2009 10:45
781,781, That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting!,6/1/1998 1:55
781,368, That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor!,4/13/1983 0:40
781,781, Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural?,10/27/1993 22:29
781,781, Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated!,9/22/1986 22:21
781,368," I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it?",5/21/1972 7:39
781,368, Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing.,9/23/1980 6:49
781,781," I know, right? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does. It'd be nice if our country could do that! ",2/19/2013 10:06
781,781, Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto! But yeah I think that is a cool idea to promote recycling. ,9/11/1980 18:19
782,1497, Agreed and help stray dogs as well. I also think its crazy that dogs can't see as many different colors as we humans can. ,3/22/1996 20:10
782,1497, Yeah that is interesting. I think it's funny when owners put shirts on their dogs. They probably put Hawaiian shirts on their dogs in Hawaii!,6/1/1977 22:38
782,1497," Ha! Probably so. You know, I've always loved the term man's best friend. They do so much for humans like companionship, hunting, protecting, pulling and even therapeutic roles, man's best friend is the perfect term, in my opinion!",3/24/2000 20:05
782,782, Yeah totally agree with you. Did you know that the official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of a traditional suit and tie?,9/2/2021 11:02
782,1497, Is it really? That's kind of funny! Ha! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore khakis and blue shirts. That was very nice of them.,11/24/2021 14:43
782,782, Interesting. In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars!,8/21/2006 2:48
782,1497, Now that's interesting. Ha! I also think it's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not. I never really realized that!,8/21/2005 8:53
782,782, Yeah I didn't know that either. I always thought polo shirts were designed by polo players but they were originally invented by tennis players!,5/9/2021 3:11
782,1497," Were they really? I figured polo players invented them as well. But you know, in American English, the term shirt is such a catch all term that represents a wide variety of upper body garments and even undergarments. ",10/25/1996 20:34
782,1497, Yeah I agree it does. In Britain they have more specific definition of the word. ,12/5/2021 9:55
783,885, Yeah it's more specifically a garner with a collar and sleeves with cuffs along with a full vertical opening with buttons. We would actually refer to it as a dress shirt. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a nice day!,3/5/1976 14:58
783,783, Many people enjoy chatting on the Internet. Do you? Do you like computers?,6/29/1973 2:40
783,885," I do actually, I use the computer a lot. I just do not have that kind that the russians made that runs on water",3/23/2013 16:38
783,783," The water computer sounds alien, like something that Elon Musk would create. I wonder how fast that darn thing ran. As fast as Windows 8 maybe.",3/2/1980 21:31
783,885," I am not sure since it was also a very long time ago, in 1936.",7/12/2002 3:48
783,783," 1936. That was a great year for water computers. Since then, not so good. I expected the Russians to make one that ran on vodka, but then again, vodka is too precious for computers. WOuld you upload your mind to a computer? If it ran on vodka, I would.",5/8/1980 12:25
783,885, No I do not think so but it seems transhumanists are trying to do that. Curious to see if they succeed,5/8/1990 11:05
783,885," If they succeed, they will have long boring lives. They will spend their time chatting on the Internet for cash to buy upgrades.",6/7/1996 9:38
783,783, That sounds very probable. DO you have a PC or an Apple computer?,11/30/1997 1:01
783,783, I have a PC. I have used Apple stuff though. You? Playstation?,4/5/1972 3:19
784,1825, Yeah I have an Apple so I guess good thing that I am not a smoker so as not to void the warranty,1/16/1988 20:20
784,784, What about vaping though? Is that a problem? Then Apple would lose like 90% of their hipster customers!,8/13/1997 16:32
784,784," Yeah, right? Do you watch youtube on your computer?",4/15/1976 18:40
784,1825, I sometimes watch YouTube to catch up on news and documentaries. You?,7/30/1973 8:45
784,784, Yeah me too. It is the second largest search engine now on the internet,8/29/1970 9:35
784,1825, People are addicted to them vids! The kids can't enough of 'em! Even I go there to listen to my old favorites from back in the day!,5/3/2018 6:53
784,1825, Cool. Do you know which is the most disliked video in there?,4/21/2001 3:44
784,784, Dislliked? I don't know. Some teen idol? Donald Trump?,6/9/1995 8:53
784,1825," Actually is it Justin Bieber, his song Baby",3/10/1976 2:18
784,784," The Bieb! That figures. The guy bothers a lot of people. He's rich, he doesn't care. Things are going his way. ",8/6/2011 20:50
785,663, I guess so . Have you heard of Bluetube?,3/18/1975 2:42
785,663," Bluetube? Sounds racy. What is it, and how much does it cost?",11/4/1993 18:08
785,785, It is actually a police YouTube. Nice chat,7/17/1986 2:28
785,663," Hi, how are you?",2/8/2015 19:56
785,785," A little tired because I didn't get enough sleep. Have you ever had a pet cat? By the time they're 15, cats have spent about 10 years of their lives sleeping",8/2/2000 23:22
785,785," Sorry, to hear that.  I have had a cat, she passed away last year and she was 18 years old.  I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping. lol",3/20/1992 10:38
785,785, I didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds!,11/7/1972 7:58
785,785," My cat was probably the easiest low maintenance pet I ever had,  A lot less needy than my dogs, for sure. Do own any pets?",7/31/1994 3:33
785,785," The only pet I've ever had are fish, though I don't mind cats. I had a friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan",4/14/1993 20:48
785,785," Yeah, I heard about those cafes.  People pay to have a drink and play with cats.  Sounds like an easy way to make money!",10/14/2016 23:16
786,1748, I'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US. Maybe that's why it hasn't become popular here. ,8/9/2019 6:30
786,786, That's true.  Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at blood drives?,7/30/1990 3:47
786,786, I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours? I know some dogs would be able to give more blood than others based on their size,10/31/2009 8:23
786,1748," I'm not sure, but they probably work the same, I'd think.  I'm sure there's a big need especially for dogs with cancers.",6/10/1986 1:00
786,1748," I think it's interesting how dogs and cats can be different, but both are useful for hunting",1/21/1994 11:05
786,1748, That is interesting. It's also interesting that Istanbul has vending machines that dispense water and food in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.,7/11/2009 4:44
786,786, That's a genius way to take care of the strays while also encouraging recycling. I bet Google would donate to that type of initiative considering the company loves dog enough to have it in their code of conduct,3/2/2021 18:33
786,1748," Yeah, they are truly a dog company!  We need these machines in America!",9/12/1987 21:03
786,1748," The stray cats could probably benefit from something like that as well. When filming the Godfather, the cat in the opening scene was actually a stray that wandered onto the set",4/26/1978 5:45
786,1748," That's cool, cat was a movie star and didn't even know it. lol I wonder if the cat named Stubbs in Talkeetna, Alaska knows that its the mayor?",10/25/2006 4:27
787,787," Since 1997, nonetheless. That's a long time for an animal to be in a political position. There must not be a large population in that part of Alaska",5/29/1995 0:45
787,787, Probably held that position longer than some politicians.  Don't have to worry about too many scandals when you're a cat!  ,2/5/1998 18:04
787,787, It's about as funny as the physicist whose cat is a coauthor just so his grammar would be correct. It was easier to add the cat than to use first person singular rather than plural,10/19/2018 8:25
787,1408," That is funny too,  You don't have to worry about your grammar either, when you're a cat. It's been nice chatting with you this afternoon.",7/6/1984 19:25
787,1408, hello there ,8/4/1992 3:48
787,787, Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight?,10/18/1995 6:25
787,787," Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself? ",8/10/1971 10:28
787,787, Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer. ,7/23/1992 0:38
787,787," I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United. ",2/8/1991 8:04
787,1408, Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago. ,8/31/1993 16:27
788,788, Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year? ,7/7/1985 2:53
788,36, No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.  ,12/12/1971 23:12
788,788," Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.  ",3/7/2005 22:54
788,36, I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began. ,10/11/1970 0:46
788,36," To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument? ",9/16/1990 8:02
788,788, I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.  ,11/30/1970 14:18
788,788," I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.  ",3/11/2004 15:42
788,788, I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.  ,5/31/2019 11:35
788,788, Did you now that the term soccer came from association football? I find that interesting. I always wondered why it wasn't called something else. ,3/17/2006 9:23
788,36, I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.  ,1/16/1982 11:25
789,789," Do you ever go to live games?  It's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy, and yet I haven't.  I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game. ",3/23/2009 15:36
789,789, I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase. ,9/4/1980 13:01
789,789," Yep, it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries. I think that's really cool. They really mean the world when they said the world cup, unlike the world series, which is just a national matchup.  That's interesting you say it's tough to pick up. I bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games.",8/27/1985 20:18
789,1451, Thats a good point about playing FIFA. That was my only exposure to the sport growing up. There's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world. Probably part of it's popularity. It's kind of funny. The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles. I don't know how else to explain the goofy ones I've seen around here after FC games.  ,3/18/1996 19:05
789,1451," Sports fans are definitely responsible for some ridiculous hats, like the oversided cowboy hat, that's like measured in gallons rather than regular hat size. I'm not a hat guy myself, my head's too big.  Speaking of cowboy hats, in the old west, the cowboy hat was not the most common hat worn.  It was actually the bowler, which truthfully is a lot classier looking in my opinion. ",3/31/2003 23:29
789,1451, Billy the Kid was a bowler hat kind of guy. I like hats because I'm bald. They keep the sweat out of my eyes and keep my head warm.  Sports fans have changed headwear from a social status thing to more of a social group identity thing. Ironically the only times I'm not likely to wear a hat is when it would be the most useful. I've worked in construction most of my life but I could never get used to wearing a hard hat. Lucky I didn't get my brains scrambled.    ,8/20/2012 18:36
789,789," Goodness. Yeah, the only time I ever wore hats was when a job required me to, for me to display whatever fast food logo I worked for.  And with that thought, I will depart. ",8/19/1970 19:33
789,789," Hi, how are you?",10/7/1981 21:56
789,789, I'm good!  Do you use youtube?,7/8/1991 7:37
789,789, I do use youtube. Do you?,12/7/2010 11:25
790,790, I do.  I love it!  It's where I first say Psy's Gangnam Style video.  Have you seen it?,7/22/2003 12:20
790,790, I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform.,6/24/1972 4:49
790,790, lol Poor Beib's.  Psy's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.,12/27/2014 6:34
790,932, You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google. Make sense since google owns them.,4/27/1975 13:42
790,932, I believe that.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion dollars!  That's a lot of cash.,11/12/2004 22:21
790,790," That is! Between youtube and netflix, they make up half of peak internet usage.",12/3/2017 20:45
790,790, I believe it!  People love videos!  Do you have a playstation?,5/16/2012 18:34
790,932, I kind of do... My son has one that I bought him. Do you have one?,11/25/1980 20:03
790,932, My kids do.  I have no idea how to play it. lolol  Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes somehow.,3/3/2019 20:58
790,790, Wow. The DoD used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer...,11/30/2020 3:49
791,1048," Wow.  Who would have thought that?  lol  The original grand theft auto game disc for playstation, when placed in a cd player would play the game soundtrack.  Kind of neat.",10/9/2017 9:59
791,791, That is cool. The last game produced for ps2 was fifa 14. I had no idea.,1/21/1974 5:19
791,1048, I didn't either!  lol  Do you use computers a lot?  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that could run on water!,6/3/2001 1:05
791,1048, I do use them a lot. The space shuttles general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of ram.,1/5/2002 3:28
791,1048, Wow.  That's pretty incredible to think about.  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.,7/1/2016 4:21
791,791, Maybe it was a transhumanist. They want to upload their mind to computers. I am not sure I would want to do that...,6/4/2020 3:06
791,791, I would want to do it so my future generations of my descendants can look back at my life.  Be interesting I think.,11/23/2016 5:41
791,1048," With that perspective, yes. Nice chatting with you!",12/22/2017 21:11
791,1048," Hi, how are you? Do you like jazz?",10/27/2003 20:29
791,1048, Hi there! Yeah I do like jazz! Do you?,7/5/1979 22:11
792,717," Yes, I love jazz. I am listening to some right now. ",4/16/2008 13:50
792,792," Ah nice! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. It's definitely rare and unique, in my opinion. ",6/7/2002 20:34
792,792," It certainly is. I think that it should be more popular, but it is too artistic. Not enough show business, too much art.",8/22/2005 16:48
792,792, Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts? Wow jazz has made it's way from New Orleans around the entire world!,5/30/2008 11:58
792,792," Yes, even in Pakistan. I figure that there is value in all genres of music. Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz.",10/16/1983 13:47
792,792," There certainly is value in all music, I agree! Which reminds me that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he's scored several films, including Million Dollar Baby!",12/9/1977 12:43
792,717," He seems like a tough guy, but he is an actor and artist so I'm not surprised. He is not a very good singer though.",12/13/2021 15:06
792,717," Haha, then maybe I should be happy I've not heard him sing! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable. I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees. Maybe, maybe not!",6/23/1970 2:14
792,717," He sang at the end of Gran Turino. I think people tried all kinds of facial hair, but for brass, maybe it's an obvious choice.",6/2/1979 7:17
792,792," Hm. I did watch that movie but I just can't remember him singing! I'll check it out again, since now I'm pretty curious! :)",4/19/2009 11:01
793,793, Right at the end. Then another singer takes over. Clint writes good melodies though. ,7/10/2015 20:09
793,793, Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well! I pretty much have the opposite problem. Haha. Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me. Speaking of cowboys! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat!,4/8/1988 0:16
793,793, I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat. ,3/25/2006 15:20
793,793," Personally I prefer cowboy hats, especially since it's associated with hard work, instead of just sophistication and such. :) ",3/5/1983 8:29
793,1568," Yes, they have their own kind of cool. the bowler looks stuffy.",9/28/2015 5:04
793,1568," I agree! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions, sun, and even beanie's for cold weather! Beanies are technically hats, right?",4/5/1977 0:55
793,1568," Yes, sure. But dont wear one to a wedding though! anyway, great chat!",1/12/2016 16:06
793,793, Yeah thanks! It's been great! :),8/7/2018 5:21
793,793, You too!,1/17/1992 17:56
793,1568," Have a great day! If it's cold outside, make sure to wear a beanie! :)",11/7/2013 6:13
794,794," Yes, by all mean.s",1/1/1975 0:23
794,771," It's pretty sunny here, so I'll maybe wear a baseball cap :) Later!",3/14/2010 7:55
794,771, Bye,4/4/2011 7:12
794,794, Bye :),8/22/2020 17:57
794,771, Hi? ,11/25/2007 1:54
794,794, Have you heard of visual novels such as Stay that run on game consoles like Xbox?,9/13/1983 2:32
794,794," No, I have not. That sounds fascinating. How is that different from a movie?",3/22/1971 20:27
794,771," You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen. ",11/18/1983 16:33
794,771, That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular?,4/9/1996 18:16
794,771," I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields. ",5/6/2010 7:41
795,795, I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation?,9/30/1991 2:06
795,1280, No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings. ,10/1/1984 10:47
795,795, I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do.,5/22/2003 2:15
795,1280, I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995?,12/5/1975 17:47
795,1280," W95 was huge for its time. It got delayed several times, but it was a big jump for Microsoft. I used it a lot myself.",2/22/2019 5:49
795,1280, Me too.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada.  I wonder if that's where the name ADA came from in computing.,11/20/1971 16:30
795,795," Yes, I believe so. There was a programming language called ADA. I never used it. She was very bright.",7/14/2000 23:14
795,1280, That's what I was saying.  It came from Pascal.  Bell distributed a manual cardboard computer to HS students in 1968 to teach them how that works.  I'd be interested in seeing that.,3/8/2001 23:39
795,1280, I see. Pascal and ADA are related languages. Is it in use now? I wouldn't expect so.,8/2/2016 11:06
795,1280," If I remember right, the gov't was pushing ADA.  There's probably a lot of legacy systems with it.  Did you know the first YouTube video was some dude talking about an elephant... ",2/29/2000 9:28
796,600, An elephant? Not ADA? LOL. I guess that makes sense. The first upload was probably pretty basic.,9/5/2012 20:07
796,796, Now there are 79 full episodes of The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross.  ,1/13/1974 22:41
796,796," Yes, that man is a legend! Encouraged so many people to try painting. There should be a paint program called Ross.",12/14/2001 17:18
796,796, Yeah.  Did you know the PS3's only have 256MB of RAM?  That's not much...,6/29/1979 11:56
796,796," That's not much at all. I'm surprised. Anyway, great chat!",7/10/1976 3:53
796,796, Thanks. ,3/30/2000 16:54
796,796, Are you a fan of Jazz? ,3/13/1985 12:33
796,600," hi how are you? yes, i like jazz. You?",1/7/1971 21:26
796,600, I do. So does Clint Eastwood apparently.,4/7/1976 20:03
796,796," Yeah, he plays piano. he also composes too, ive heard.",6/11/1976 14:35
797,797, I didn't know that. That is pretty cool. ,11/2/1995 16:42
797,408," He is allergic to horses, i think, so maybe he spends more time at the piano now.",9/7/2003 13:24
797,797," Interesting, I wonder how he shot all of those films then? ",8/22/1980 21:09
797,408," I think he wasnt allergic at first, but then developed an allergy. maybe he is getting treatment now? i dont know",7/30/1995 3:45
797,408, Interesting. Who would have guessed? ,6/30/2000 23:29
797,408, I wonder if clint knows that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.,10/11/1971 2:51
797,797," I'm not sure, but that is a good question. Do you like hats? ",1/13/2022 14:55
797,797," hats are good. stylish, functional. i dont wear them often. You?",8/9/1972 22:26
797,797," Nah, I think they promote baldness. LOL",10/9/2007 17:42
797,797," good thing i dont wear them then. LOL. Im surprised that the most popular hat in the old west was the bowler, not the cowboy hat",7/29/1979 10:27
798,798, Interesting. I would have thought the cowboy hat myself. ,6/28/2018 15:10
798,196," Yeah, maybe that is a working hat and people wanted to be stylish? i dont know. ",12/12/1997 14:30
798,196, I'm not sure to be honest. There was a law in 1908 that limited the length of hairpins. ,9/11/1973 1:36
798,196," boy, those women and their hairpins! LETHAL! LOL i guess women did not carry guns then? that would have been funny",7/17/2004 16:14
798,196," Yeah, sounds pretty comical. Well, nice chatting with you!",3/21/1992 20:03
798,196," Yes, it has been great chatting! I'm glad that the server is back up! Yay",3/25/1990 9:47
798,798, Take it easy!,11/10/2008 2:58
798,196, Hello did you know the only fish to have a neck is the seahorse?,5/29/2000 13:07
798,798, I never thought about it but that is interesting! I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes!,12/24/1972 7:41
798,798," And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever. ",5/26/1993 7:22
799,930, Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals.,2/5/1976 6:43
799,930," Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?  I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow is amazing,  to have the ability to have their body stretch like that,  who knows when their next meal will come along. ",11/17/2021 2:12
799,930, I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this...  I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there!,6/3/2005 1:02
799,930," oh thats too bad, sorry to hear.  Haha Fisher,  thats a great name.  Freshwater fish drink water through their skin!",11/25/1992 3:18
799,799, Interesting! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. Crazy!,11/21/1995 14:38
799,799, Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet!  theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects in the amazon rainforest still. ,4/7/1985 11:24
799,930, The rainforest frightens me. Too many creatures! I can only imagine how many insects are in there!  Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?,9/14/1986 18:42
799,799, I didnt.  I guess I would never notice because my dog is white lol,12/25/1970 0:27
799,930, That is funny. My dog has a white patch ...but not on it's forehead!  They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs.,11/17/2017 9:51
799,799, I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water. ,11/17/2005 23:32
800,1404, I agree! Look...I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating. Exhausting!,4/14/1973 16:07
800,1404," I know right, thats incredible.  I also love sleeping. ",3/24/2004 0:43
800,1404, Naps are the best! I like that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Where do you think they hide it?,3/5/2009 6:25
800,800, The hummingbirds?  I have no clue lol Where do they hide?,2/22/2016 11:25
800,1404, No!  I was asking where they hide the spiderweb when they are stealing it.  I was trying to be funny.  Didn't work!  LOL!  One fact is that birds bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!,2/14/2013 12:44
800,1404," Oh lol  Thats horrible, i wouldnt want hollow bones lol I guess it makes sense for them,  they have to be light enough to fly ",1/16/2002 16:32
800,1404," True! Good point! In Australia there are wild birds that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms and chainsaws! Creepy!",2/4/2013 12:47
800,1404, wow that is really creepy!  I wonder what bird does that lol Its been fun chatting. ,4/22/2002 22:53
800,1404," hi, do you like soccer?",2/2/2008 21:17
800,800, To be honest I don't like soccer. But I may watch the World Cup if the USA makes it to that point. What about you?,4/25/1981 17:59
801,1414, Yeah I like it because it is so international. did  you know the city where it will be hosted in 2022 does not exist yet,8/15/2000 2:49
801,801," That is crazy. Are you going to watch it? I don't know how they can just create a city out of nowhere and have it ready for 2022, but we'll see what happens",3/15/1981 13:50
801,1414," Yeah I am looking forward to it and yes, I do not know how that is going to work",3/9/2009 23:24
801,801, I do like the United States and soccer though. They got third place back in 1930 which was the first FIFA World Cup,4/3/1978 22:53
801,801," Nice, maybe they manage to climb back. you never know. The countries that host it do not have any net economic gains",3/15/1970 11:09
801,1414, Nope I heard about that. That's why I wonder why they're making an entire city for the World Cup. I guess the women's soccer team is better than the men's soccer team in the United States. Is that correct?,11/3/1980 17:49
801,801," Yup, they seem to do much better. soccer players make more money than other sports combined, well the major ones",7/22/1981 4:51
801,1414, That is really crazy. I know that football the United States makes a ton of money too. I always wondered why Americans call it soccer. I guess that is slang for association football,5/4/1974 1:15
801,801, Yeah I think football means differnt things in many different countries,7/15/2003 11:10
801,1414, Yeah I think you're right. I want to see the soccer variation with three teams. I bet that's really insane,11/19/1986 16:50
802,1427, yeah that would be interesting to know. a german soccer player donated his winning from the world cup to kids in brazil,6/13/2015 2:46
802,1427, Wow that's really nice of him. I think it was something like three hundred thousand Euros? And it was paying for surgeries for those kids. That is so nice,7/2/1989 14:04
802,1427, that is super heartwarming. do you know jon stewart?,12/23/2007 3:56
802,1427, I do know him. I think he was on The Daily Show correct?,1/16/2011 11:54
802,802, Yeah he is and he was also a very skilled soccer player,3/30/1998 15:11
802,1427, I didn't know that. what are your thoughts on Tom Hanks?,10/14/2021 17:10
802,1427, I love the guy he is so talented. he is the highest box office star,6/22/2018 14:26
802,1427, Yep I agree. He has a lot of awesome movies. I guess he's made almost 9 billion dollars worldwide with his film earnings. That is so much!,1/21/1981 7:05
802,1427," Wow, that is insane. nice chat :)",7/5/2003 13:10
802,802," Hello there, do you follow the MLS?",7/21/2005 4:30
803,803," I do, I  think Wayne Rooney is a great acquisition for the leage what about you?",8/31/1996 10:54
803,803, Yeah I think it was good not only for him and his family but for the league as a whole. ,2/12/1994 7:19
803,803," I agree, he played at great teams and his an icon of soccer for sure, but there are other great players as well like Ibrahimovich",8/9/1975 21:06
803,133, Yeah I think that has become the new norm is for world class players to end their careers here in the US. ,8/9/1985 16:56
803,803," There is also another great player that played before Rooney his name is Roy Wegerle, ",10/14/2007 1:01
803,133, Yeah I guess Roy was a hell of a player.  I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career. ,3/18/1987 7:32
803,133," He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson, his been a pro since age 16, he sure has a good level of skill",4/26/1982 15:14
803,133, Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer.  They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be. ,7/12/1989 21:31
803,803," Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there, sometimes its just a matter of luck , did you watch the last FIFA World Cup?",11/26/1987 14:56
803,803, Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around.  How about you?,6/24/2011 3:37
804,39," I did, I thought it was a great World Cup, I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall, I also liked how Croatia played.",11/23/1974 17:47
804,39," Yeah France had an amazing team and they finally played like it.  Belgium, Croatia, and England did fairly well as well.  I think Japan had some of the most exciting games to watch of all the teams. ",9/26/1992 7:38
804,804," I agree, those teams were also pretty good and almost made it, Im exited about the World Cup thats going to be hosted in Qatar by 2022 and then in the US by 2026",8/3/1995 3:43
804,39, Yeah the Qatar one will be too different for me though.  Watching the world cup in the middle of winter will be strange.,6/3/2022 23:31
804,39," It will be weird I bet the players wont notice it thouhg as Qatar must be really hot even on winter time, its too bad the American soccer team isnt as good in the male category as it is on the female one",7/24/2006 13:34
804,804, Yeah the men's team needed a whole rebuild.  They have years to go before they are anywhere close to where the women's team is. ,6/30/2007 8:46
804,39," I agree, the womans team always place third or above, they must have a lot of support from the government",8/25/1972 21:38
804,804, That and I don't think other countries around the world have the women's programs in place like we do here in the US. ,6/16/2001 4:37
804,39," Yeah I think they only support mens teams but who know even then the US team might be really great, do you know who Ozil is?",12/17/1988 4:00
804,804," Yeah of course I do, I follow the english league very closely.  How about you?",5/30/1976 5:19
805,805," I do, I like the premier legue and also the Spain league, well Ozil danated his winning bonus on 2014 to children in Brazil so that they could get surgery",1/29/1999 7:29
805,157," Yeah I remember seeing that, very cool.  Well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a nice day. ",3/6/1990 1:12
805,805, Hello.,9/3/1985 17:14
805,157, Hey!  How are you today?  Are you an animal person?  I live in Florida so we have a ton of wildlife.  One I don't like is jellyfish!  There is a breed that is immortal!,12/14/1998 14:44
805,805, I have never seen a jellyfish in person. I love animals though.,12/23/2002 7:38
805,805, I have almost stepped on a few when they wash up on the beach.  Scary stuff.  Fish in general can be scary like the black swallower than can eat prey ten times its weight.,3/3/1996 20:30
805,805, Yeah and twice its own length. Wonder where it puts it all.,8/2/1996 11:12
805,157," No kidding!  Only one fish has a neck, the seahorse.  That seems crazy to me!",6/16/1983 17:51
805,157, Did you know freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis.,2/5/2004 16:28
805,157," I did not know that!  I think as animal lovers we would be happy in Germany.  In 2002, they universally gave animals constitutional rights.",3/4/1984 7:45
806,806, I dont know about taking it that far. Seems like they ma be trying to make up for something over there in germany.,7/17/2019 13:02
806,806," Haha, very true.  That is a lot of animals to give right to!  I do now know how many are in Germany, but there are 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet!",7/18/1994 2:37
806,806, That is a boat load of animals huh.,12/3/2017 11:03
806,1378, I can't even comprehend that number!  It is sad so many go extinct like the dodo bird.,3/25/1978 19:37
806,1378, That is sad. Have you heard where hiccups ome from.,3/24/1982 16:52
806,1378," Yes, I have actually.  They are a holdover from long ago when the first land animals had both gills and lungs.",11/24/2004 14:03
806,806, Exactly what I was gonna say. Do you like birds.,10/13/1991 17:24
806,806," I do, we have a ton of those in Florida too!  They can trace birds back to 170 million years ago! Wild!",10/4/1983 3:49
806,806, Some birds fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping when migrating.,12/5/2002 11:00
806,1378, That is a crazy fact!  Probably helps that their bones are very hollow and their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.,11/30/1986 1:10
807,319, That probably doe help.,11/8/1971 21:46
807,319," Yea, keeps them aerodynamic!",5/10/2004 0:36
807,807, I really do love birds. Ttyl.,4/8/2012 8:36
807,319, Do you like sports?,3/16/2005 10:06
807,319," I'm not really into sports, but soccer isn't bad. My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14, I think",11/22/2002 17:25
807,807, Oh tell me more,4/20/1981 18:57
807,807, Apparently he peaked early though and never really became as great as he could be,10/28/1993 18:02
807,319, That is a shame. Do you watch the world cup?,2/1/2007 12:51
807,319," No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to. He said I should start with women's soccer because the female US team hasn't placed lower than third since they started in 1991.",9/11/1999 9:44
807,807," Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned",11/27/1975 21:50
808,1029," Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined.",3/10/1995 12:57
808,808, That is because soccer is the most popular internationally,6/1/1989 19:59
808,1029, I asked my boyfriend why it's called soccer here and he said it was slang for association football in the states.,9/14/2021 15:30
808,808," Honestly, football and american football confused the heck out of me when I was younger. Calling it soccer made it easier",9/21/2004 15:51
808,808, Maybe they should just call American football :stupid ball and get it over with. I heard the city set to host the fifa in 2022 doesn't even exist yet.,7/8/2018 13:29
808,1029, True many countries want to host despite no immediate economic benefits,10/16/2020 7:48
808,808," That's really surprising, I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either. I guess the whole process is so taxing to the economy and people.",9/10/1979 0:45
808,1029," Perhaps but it also provides prestige, advertisement, tourism, and jobs so I guess it is worth it",10/18/1997 10:12
808,1029," I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money. I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery.",11/28/2011 21:40
808,1029, That is very generous of him,10/17/1995 4:55
809,809, I heard Jon Stewart was a footballer as well.,3/11/1988 9:57
809,809, I hope soccer continues to maintain such a healthy spirit despite allegations of corruption surrounding the league,8/24/2014 6:11
809,809, I am sure it will only gain in popularity as Americans start looking outside the country for what's new and different,7/1/1981 4:08
809,553, I agree. Thanks for your time.,3/13/2000 7:52
809,809," Hi, do you like wine?",10/6/1997 4:22
809,809," I am not a big wine drinker, I have it occasionally but sometimes it gives me very bad headaches.",9/30/1995 12:14
809,553, I guess Oregon wine is making a big push to be great! I had no idea!,8/19/2003 18:18
809,553," I know California is a major wine region, I guess the entire West Coast is a good place to have vineyards.",11/18/1996 21:40
809,553, Yeah. I really want to do a vineyard tour in Napa. Have you ever been?,7/2/1973 15:46
809,809, No I have not. I will be traveling to Portland this year so I may have to see these Oregon vineyards firsthand now.,4/2/2000 22:58
810,810, Nice. My sister loves a vineyard in Oregon. I cannot remember the name though. She got pretty drunk on it and spent like $500 on a few cases.,10/18/2000 22:56
810,1895," I'll have to watch how much wine I have, I don't know if I have enough space in my luggage to bring a few cases home.",12/29/2019 12:50
810,810," No, she had them mailed to her house! We have different priorities... I do not mind wine in a box. She has standards. Ha!",7/1/2017 22:45
810,1895, I believe a lot more wineries are using the box delivery method. I think it saves them money and helps keep the wine fresher.,3/30/2013 19:06
810,810, I think so too. Do you enjoy star wars?,7/3/1975 13:18
810,1895, Yes I've watched all the movies. I'm probably not as big a fan as a lot of people. How about you?,8/7/2005 4:43
810,1895, I do like them but am not a huge fan. I thought I knew a lot but then got humbled by a true fan. They take that stuff really seriously!,4/13/1996 4:15
810,1895," Yes they do, I have heard a lot of them reference stories from outside the movies. I did not know there was so much lore in that universe.",5/10/1979 13:33
810,810, I had no idea the original lightsaber is in the international space station. Wow...,7/31/1983 17:56
810,810," That's really cool, I wonder if any of the astronauts have taken it out to pretend to be Luke Skywalker.",1/19/2002 15:08
811,811," I would! I would also keep it secret like they did in empire strikes back, telling the crew lies!",12/21/2000 9:29
811,811, That must have been great to watch the crew's reaction when the real line was filmed!,1/10/1993 6:42
811,324, I think they have done that with other shows in the past to not give away the ending of finales...,8/29/1993 2:36
811,324," Yes I have heard that they'll make fake scripts, only allow certain people on set, and put the names of actors on script pages in case it leakes.",6/16/1975 9:40
811,324, Nice chatting with you!,2/5/1971 17:01
811,811, I'm so ready for daylight savings time and longer days. Did you know that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long?,5/21/1990 21:35
811,811," interesting, lets talk about the planets more. Most planets spin around the run but uranus rolls around it. ",7/12/1996 18:54
811,324, That's interesting. Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,2/15/2005 18:01
811,811," i did not, there is a planet 455 light-years away that might have the building blocks of life",11/25/1978 7:39
811,324, That's amazing! As long as it's not the planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!,7/10/2002 15:22
812,80, Not to mention on that same planet the temperature is 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. ,10/14/2003 21:23
812,80, That definitely sounds like Hell to me!,2/5/2021 1:17
812,812, Lets talk about Luke Skywalker next. He is played by Mark Hamill and was originally written as a woman. ,10/31/1989 20:56
812,812, That's interesting. I want to book an overnight stay at his boyhood home!,8/14/1999 12:34
812,80," I would also want to, it only cost $10 but its in Tunisia ",11/27/2004 10:58
812,812, That would be an amazing stay. ,4/26/1979 23:58
812,812, They kept the relationship of Luke and Vader a secret throughout the filming. The cast and crew did not know the entire time. ,5/28/2017 4:38
812,80," That had to have helped the suspense. Did you know the original lightsaber prop is inside the International Space Station, and was flown by sts-120 in August 2007?",5/2/1978 18:57
812,812, I did not. They hid the secret from the cast and crew and gave them a fake script where it said obi-wan killed his father. ,2/23/2007 2:52
812,80," Wow, what a great scheme! In 1981, Star Wars: A New Hope was dramatized and turned into a 5-hour long radio broadcast. I'd like to listen to that!",5/8/1978 21:19
813,75, I would also. Lets talk about earth next. its sad to think that more then 80 percent of the earths forest are already gone ,4/28/2016 13:52
813,813," It is awful. We're destroying this planet inch by inch in the short time we've been here. If the earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!",1/24/1992 15:44
813,75," The earth will be pretty much helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what happens then. ",7/5/1984 3:48
813,813, No more balloons. ,2/6/1974 6:00
813,813, That's one thing I guess. There is an appointed ambassador to extraterrestrials just in case they want to say hi ,4/25/1991 22:34
813,75," That's cool, I wonder if that was the inspiration for Space Force?",3/26/2009 3:38
813,813, Maybe. The earth was formed more then 4.5 billions years ago. It was nice talking to you .,3/16/1991 6:58
813,75, Good Morning! The weekend is very near. Have you got any plans?,5/12/1979 12:56
813,75, Good morning! No I don't as yet.  I'd like to get out and see some stars some night soon.  I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans?,1/23/1979 15:47
813,75, Not so much yet. My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them. ,9/9/1997 16:05
814,814, Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like.,1/24/1991 4:30
814,784, My brother and I are not much of drinkers. I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though. like average 14.3%? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though. ,1/18/1974 15:58
814,814," I think you can.  Some wines go good with food.  There is a wine, La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood.",5/24/1972 0:13
814,814," I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood, but honestly I'm not sure what food they're going to have. I think maybe pasta or steak?",4/2/1974 19:11
814,784," That sounds good.  I've heard that red wines go good with beef.  I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castilla, Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes.",6/8/1974 4:03
814,814, I might just go with that option. I've always thought of wine to be high-end and expensive but at $18 a bottle its pretty reasonable. ,6/4/1978 12:10
814,814," I think it definitely is reasonable and with so many wines out there nowadays price is probably no longer an issue.  I mean, the bottle I was telling you about comes from Spain!",6/18/1983 23:40
814,784, I like to hear some critics reviews on some wines because of the way they describe the taste of the drinks. ,11/5/1981 11:29
814,814, I know what you mean. They make them sound beautiful and perfect.  I know of one that is described to have the aroma of white flowers and have an appealing waxy texture.  I am not sure how wax can be appealing however.,5/8/2009 3:38
814,784, It sounds like they ate wax sometime in their lives! There's one I enjoyed hearing that said they 'whack you in the face with an oak two by four' ,3/2/2014 23:26
815,815, Hahaha! I wonder what that means!  I've heard of one that is described to be racy.  I didn't know wine could be racy.,12/6/1993 2:47
815,815," For the 14th, I'd definitely recommend a Smith-Madrone chardonnay. Critiques say it wraps you in a lovingly warm blanket. ",10/1/2006 9:40
815,815, That does sound nice.  Wines sound romantic and such until you learn where you can buy them at.  Some wines are available at a store called the Wine Outlet.  ,7/21/1980 17:48
815,815, It sounds so convenient and easy to decide where to get them from now too. I know they can be ordered online too!,1/19/2020 2:50
815,815," I've heard that too.  It does make it convenient, especially since so many wines are made all of the world such as In Puglia, Italy.",5/25/1998 0:46
815,815, All these wines from europe sound and im sure theyre good. I think I'd rather support some from USA though. I know california has a few good ones. ,2/23/2013 3:11
815,815," Definitely.  Napa Valley California is known for wine, particularly chardonnays like the Smith-Madrone chardonnay.",4/27/1994 18:08
815,815, I feel like the west coast is where to go. California and Oregon both seem to have the better reviews. ,1/31/1994 8:54
815,1715, I was reading a factual section about Luke Skywalker and found it very interesting that his role was initially written as a girl,5/16/1980 18:45
815,1715, I had no idea! I also read that the original light saber that he used is in the space station.,8/9/1984 14:12
816,816," thats some cool stuff. It seems to be an extremely well-liked franchise, I personally really like how the writers changed up the script so the secret of darth vader being Luke's father wouldn't be leaked ",4/13/1975 20:47
816,1382, I never knew that there was a radio broadcast of the film in 1981.  It would be fun to listen to as a podcast now.,3/30/2005 10:29
816,1382, Agreed! though 5 hours is a little long of my liking lol,12/12/2012 17:39
816,816, I knew that luke was a twin to Princess Leia but i can't keep up with the other relatives and relationships. I would have to binge watch all of the movies.,11/29/2006 19:47
816,1382, that's going to take you a few days to do! It's cool how scientists have discovered a planters that has the building blocks of life. Maybe the star wars franchise depicts what the entire universe would look like in a few hundred years,9/24/1971 21:40
816,816, That would be amazing. The UN made an ambassador of extraterrestrials incase we ever make contact with any. Ha!,3/1/2000 21:36
816,1382," ahaha very true. The UN definitely knows something that the rest of us don't. Seems like an odd job to have, how would you even have the qualifications for something like that",11/6/2002 0:50
816,1382," And are they really paid? Who knows? Are you interested in Earth science? Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5 and half hours long?",3/6/1975 11:43
816,1382," how would you even communicate with aliens, i doubt they would speak a recognizable language lol if they already created this positions maybe we'll have contact with extraterrestrials sooner than we thought. If they came to earth do you think it'd be a friendly visit? and yes I am! so cool!",3/14/1991 13:51
816,816, I have watch enough science fiction movies. It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming. The earth is 71% water and I am afraid the polar ice caps are melting!,5/22/1978 1:12
817,1014," yeah thats a common theme i noticed in movies too! They're much more advanced and powerful, yet humans always seem to win the battle some way. But maybe aliens would be chill and would want peace with humans. You're so right, and to think that there are people who don't believe in global warming",11/27/2003 16:55
817,817, I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed. Very sad,1/31/1987 20:59
817,1014, Seems like we're destroying Earth very quickly. the article mentioned that human's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth's entire history. Yet already we've done so much damage ,5/19/1972 5:04
817,817, We really do have an amazing planet in that it sustains life but  there are so many planets in the universe. I wonder how uranus rolls around the sun rather than spins?,10/14/1981 1:13
817,817, Honestly to think about how any of this exists is amazing. have you read that there's a planet with pieces of glass that perpetuate sideways at 4500mph? that almost sounds made up ,12/24/1971 18:43
817,1014, That is not something I have never heard. The fact that building blocks of life we detected 455 light years away is difficult to fathom.,3/6/1999 5:51
817,817, Maybe there's a planet in our universe that also has living life forms. It's interesting how Venus doesn't title so therefore it has no seasons,6/28/2012 4:33
817,817, Also I had known that Jupiter had moons but that one of them would be considered a planet if it rotated around the sun is pretty cool.,7/20/1988 7:01
817,817, Funny how the definition of planets is controversial and how Pluto is technically no longer considered as one,9/8/2000 19:14
817,817, That involves a lot of updating of text books!,5/25/2004 8:32
818,1923, I guess this is just the natural progression of science. definitions will change and we'll continue to discover new things,9/3/2008 5:04
818,818, It has been nice chatting!,7/9/1994 0:08
818,818, yes! enjoy the rest of the day!,1/14/1992 9:56
818,818, Thanks!,5/26/2007 20:19
818,818, thanks!,9/28/1996 16:45
818,1923," hi how are you? i think we are back online. Lets talk about the earth, shall we?",12/14/1992 20:19
818,1923, I live on it. ,11/8/2011 10:38
818,1923," Yes, it is a great place to live! I have lived here my entire life.",11/20/2020 20:08
818,818," LOL, did you know that the earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century? ",10/1/1997 13:01
818,818, I wonder why that is. where does helium come from and where does it go? we will have to find a solution to that.,9/27/1989 4:42
819,966, I'm not actually sure. I'm actually not even sure if that is true. ,7/21/1985 20:36
819,966," Yeah, sometimes the facts that i encounter in this vicinity of the internet seem a little less than factish. ",7/6/1986 1:54
819,819," Yup, I can't disagree there. Did you know the UN already has an ambassador to aliens? ",6/11/1993 13:21
819,966, I wonder who decided that was necessary. and how much of the budget goes to cover that job. how do i get that job?,4/5/2018 9:23
819,819, I'm not sure. It sounds sort of iffy to me. ,8/6/1997 4:29
819,819," Yeah, i guess they need a background in science, and maybe a ton of political connections. LOL",12/2/1972 23:37
819,819," Hilarious, yeah, who knows? Or maybe they are just some weirdo? ",11/10/1996 18:02
819,819," Yeah. Hey, that guy is a nutter, but we cant fire him. Alien ambassador? Yeah, he will buy that. give him that job.",8/31/1980 21:07
819,819," BINGO! Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long? ",1/31/2016 3:21
819,819," That is amazing. soon the day will be quite long, if humans are still around. the 20 hour work day. hm.",1/6/2014 7:51
820,820," Exactly, I already do a 20 hour work day. LOL",6/15/2013 14:50
820,617," Yes, one of the privileges of modern life LOL. Our time on this earth is short, but our work day is not.",12/30/1993 2:52
820,820, Correct. Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie? ,5/17/1987 11:15
820,820," I havent seen it. but i have heard good things. i think that gal gadot is great casting. Anyway, great chat!",7/22/2008 4:53
820,617," Yeah, I haven't seen it either. Nice chatting with you!",4/23/2008 11:07
820,820, Have a good evening! lets hope that the server stays up!,7/5/1970 13:22
820,820," hey there, do you like movies?",5/18/1999 5:41
820,820, I do. I actually saw 50 Shades of Grey with a friend for Valentine's Day in IMAX.,2/16/2009 7:14
820,617, that was a huge box office hit. do you know who is the highest all time box star?,9/14/1978 13:02
820,820," No, who is it?",12/12/1995 8:07
821,360," tom hanks, and I am not surprised he is a good actor",3/18/1983 20:48
821,360," He is very likable and doesn't take on bad roles, so he should be one of the top earners, even though less skilled actors can manage to do pretty well.",5/24/1992 23:48
821,360, that is very true. his movies seem to always have a good morale about them,7/3/1975 5:32
821,821, Do you think he would have brought anything to the table in an action film like Wonder Woman?,6/30/1995 6:41
821,360," oh for sure, wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie",5/2/1984 4:11
821,360," I'd like to see more female-led movies top the box office, how about you?",6/18/2020 23:17
821,821, me too. I am excited and looking forward to wonder woman 2,11/27/1989 19:09
821,360, I think it's interesting that the prequels that were released as follow-ups to the Original Star Wars weren't as profitable,9/22/1979 20:19
821,360," I know, I guess everyone just really loved the trilogy ",8/19/1979 23:38
821,821, I'm glad there won't be another trilogy of 50 Shades of Garbage movies haha,2/10/1997 18:30
822,1114," Oh yes, no thank you, I do not see the point of that. did you know that Gal Gadot who plays wonder woman served in the israeli defense forces?",12/6/1988 1:07
822,822," It's always nice to see someone bring some street cred to their art by having real life experience, right?",6/27/2016 7:08
822,1114, of course. and she did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman,7/12/2013 15:56
822,1114," That's pretty crazy! Some say the Dakota Johnson got her role in 50 Shades through nepotism, but she actually ended up carrying the films.",7/22/1970 4:42
822,1114, You never know I guess what goes on behind the curtains,12/4/1981 23:17
822,822," Yes, especially on set. Apparently the author of the books and the director of the movie could not agree on a common vision for 50 Shades as a film.",2/6/1994 17:50
822,822, that must have been tough and taken time to figure out. it was nice chatting with you,11/12/1976 15:23
822,1114, DO you follow box office movies?,4/14/1973 13:59
822,822, Yes I do. Do you know who is the star of box office?,7/30/1983 13:58
822,822, Yes it is Tom Hanks with over $8.5 billion overall,7/20/1995 22:56
823,1272, Yeah that is awesome. Did you know Disney considered closing their studio once?,3/16/2013 5:19
823,823, Yes after Sleeping Beauty totally flopped in box office,7/11/2008 9:17
823,823," Yeah I am glad they kept going though, they have made some awesome movies",3/5/1997 17:06
823,1272, True . Do you know how much Trojan cost to make?,2/28/1986 22:52
823,823, Yes it was a staggering $15 million and made only over $309,10/19/1988 9:29
823,1272," That was a huge loss on behalf of the studio, sadly",4/9/1997 12:00
823,1272, Yeah. Did you see WOnder Woman?,1/31/2015 9:11
823,1272," I did and I really loved it, it was great, and you?",7/13/2007 2:52
823,823, Yes me too. It is the highest grossing origin superhero movie,8/7/1976 7:38
823,823, Yes and also the highest grossing WWII movie too,10/6/2018 17:23
824,824, Yes. And also one of the three top grossing with a female lead,11/5/2014 10:38
824,824, Nice. Did you know Gal Gadot was in the Israeli defense forces,8/30/1981 14:07
824,824, So cool. When she was auditioning she did not know it was for wonder woman,4/30/1985 19:59
824,824, Yes she thought it was for catwoman instead,7/17/1990 23:20
824,367, Yes. Did you know the wonder woman was first introduced as a secretary?,12/22/2002 1:23
824,824, Yes that was back in 1941 but she has made her way through now,7/6/2019 9:12
824,367, Yeah. It was nice chatting with you,2/14/1971 4:22
824,824, Same here and have a good one,11/30/1995 13:07
824,824," Hi, do you like baseball?",7/27/1997 12:50
824,367, yah i like baseball.. what abt u?,12/17/1972 4:31
825,825, I love baseball. Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed?,12/12/2012 5:20
825,825, ohh nice.. A 3 million $ worth of 1900s baseball cards in his baseball games played each yr,2/9/2008 10:06
825,825, Wow that's crazy. Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada.,10/9/1994 7:33
825,825, hmm its also crazy..  what abt shoe?,3/5/2012 0:16
825,993, I like shoes. Do you?,8/24/1985 7:09
825,993, i love shoe.. i have 30 pairs of shoe..,3/22/1981 10:11
825,825, Wow that's a lot of shoes. Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15.,10/13/2021 15:47
825,993, which shoe brand u like?,2/10/1983 16:18
825,993, I love Nike. What about you?,1/4/1975 8:03
825,993, i like adidas ,3/1/2017 1:50
826,1593, Adidas is good too. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week.,6/4/1979 7:53
826,826, hmm yah.. 5000 yr old shoe perform better than modern shoes,10/27/2002 4:05
826,1593, That's pretty crazy. You would think shoes would have gotten better over time.,11/28/2003 18:48
826,1593, what abt Target?,1/22/2006 5:54
826,826, My wife likes to shop at Target. I'm not a huge fan. I think they have expensive products.,11/23/2016 9:57
826,1593, yah i m also think that way.. ,9/25/1998 6:22
826,826, I agree. I saw Best Buy and Target will price match Amazon.,12/1/1970 14:07
826,826, I think walmart is littlely low price to compare Target,3/17/2013 8:11
826,1593," I agree. Well, it was great chatting with you!",4/30/2015 10:37
826,1593," Hi, how are you?",9/21/1984 4:51
827,827, I am good. How are you?  Do you like baseball?  Have you ever heard of their unwritten rules such as if you hit one of our we'll hit one of yours?,7/31/1987 1:34
827,503," Well, Yes and yes. I do not like the unwritten rules. Seems too unfun... Do you like them?",12/1/2019 7:09
827,503," Some of them seem more like common sense to me.  I mean, not bringing a pet to the batting cage for one makes sense.",10/20/1996 15:03
827,827," That one does make sense. Mine are more like, pimp your HR trot. Go ahead. Ill be better next time...",6/30/2011 17:20
827,503, I like the unwritten rule of don't eat baked beans before a double header and don't order out for sushi during a rain delay.,1/4/1989 11:17
827,827," I understand the baked beans, that's common courtesy... But what's wrong with sushi?",7/31/2007 6:43
827,827," I don't know, maybe they think the guy will get sick or something.  The players do do some running to bases and maybe they think that'll slow them down.",1/1/1992 0:46
827,503, Makes sense. I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit.,8/13/1998 11:40
827,503, What does the rule say about those?,5/19/2005 0:56
827,827," Don't do those things. If you are down big, you shouldn't steal. If you have not gotten a hit, you shouldn't bunt.",4/29/2012 8:56
828,828, I don't think I like those either.  It would seem to me you would want to steal and try to make some runs.  Hey did you know that a team will get three bases if the opposing team catches a ball in their hat?,5/6/2011 9:31
828,746, I know a ton about baseball but had no idea that is a rule. Thanks for the knowledge!,11/15/2004 6:26
828,746, I've watched my fair share of games and never knew that till recently myself!  I just thought of some more common sense rules though.  How about don't drop a gum wrapper in the dug out?,3/3/2018 21:31
828,828, Or be hygienic and don't spit seeds all over the dug out. So gross. Or chew tabacco!,10/6/1972 18:47
828,828, I don't think there's much chance of this one:  don't throw an Eephus pitch to anyone named Eephus.,12/5/1995 15:50
828,746, Who the hell knows someone names Eephus let alone someone named Eephus in the MLB???,2/19/1997 13:27
828,746," I know, right?!  Some of these rules are so odd!  Some I don't understand like don't throw a four seam fastball to a five tool player.",11/2/2009 8:49
828,746, They need to write these down because I am getting confused...,5/12/1984 11:31
828,828, They really do but these are the unwritten ones.  I guess you're supposed to just know.  Not wearing a batting glove to brunch is one I would just know.,2/28/1980 12:17
828,746, Nice chatting with you!,8/4/1995 18:17
829,1328, hi how are you? do you like baseball?,9/10/1995 4:22
829,829," Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd.",12/16/2010 6:37
829,1328, that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader.,5/20/2018 20:44
829,1328," Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then.",3/29/2021 22:57
829,1328," yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment.",3/23/1985 6:41
829,829," Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact.",2/4/2016 18:24
829,829," that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards?",6/14/1978 14:02
829,1328," Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that?",12/16/1990 10:08
829,1328," yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going.",4/2/1998 13:01
829,1328," Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime.",12/3/1972 7:39
830,830," yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB>",4/9/1970 8:04
830,1973," Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness.",2/18/1999 11:35
830,830," yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that. ",8/5/1979 16:36
830,1973," Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop.",11/17/2009 18:10
830,1973," i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match.",2/8/1997 6:10
830,830," Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996.",10/2/1978 12:19
830,1973," yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money.",4/29/2002 0:01
830,830," Yeah, I agree to let people buy and sell what they want to we are free here, its nice. I think they sell ballet shoes there too and I know my daughter goes through 4 pairs a week as a professional ballet dancer.",3/16/1996 18:20
830,830," I would probably go through 10 pairs. I would not be any good as a ballerina. Anyway, great chat!",1/30/1975 22:37
830,830," HA, yeah me too.. I need to find some slippers at Target. They should have a ton available.",10/30/1992 2:45
831,831, Slippers? Ok. I did not know that. Have a great day!,3/18/1995 23:33
831,831, Slippers are good for watching baseball games on tv. I need to catch up on that New York Giants game today. They beat the Dodgers.,10/2/2006 21:52
831,1645, What? Football and baseball? I dont get it.,2/17/2019 8:39
831,1645," Yeah, I don't know why they named them the same either. Good chatting with ya and have a great rest of your day watching all sports, like me.",10/3/1970 15:11
831,1645, Hi do you have an Android or an iPhone?,11/2/2009 9:38
831,1645," Hi there, I have an iPhone and you?",3/4/1970 0:53
831,831, Nice me too. Did you know women are more likely to own one than men?,1/31/1978 5:33
831,1645, I wonder why though. Have you heard of the game Send me to heaven?,11/22/1972 18:29
831,831," I have , that is the game where people throw their phones as high as they can",6/9/1991 18:18
831,1645, Yeah and that is why Apple had to get in between and ban the game. Pretty stupid one,3/10/1993 13:58
832,832, Yeah agree. When the iPhone came out Jobs has to have identical ones with him as they kept crashing during the reveal,10/3/1980 17:00
832,832, Yeah that is pretty cool. Microsoft held a funeral for the iPhone when they revealed theirs,8/11/1993 13:33
832,832, Yeah that did not go very well because the iPhone sales have sky rocketed,6/15/2008 15:05
832,310, True. Do you listen to the radio?,1/1/2000 12:05
832,310," I do sometimes, I listen to Pandora and you?",12/23/1996 12:19
832,832," Me too, it is a good one. They have a revenue of #274 million but their net income is negative",9/6/1989 5:07
832,310, Yeah that is strange to me. They now are streaming comedy also,4/9/1994 22:53
832,310, Yeah they are branching it seems. Did you know Swift removed her music from there?,1/17/1980 3:05
832,310, Actually she removed it from Spotify because she does not believe it should be free but kept it in Pandora,6/27/1997 15:06
832,832," Right, not sure if that worked well for her though. Aloe Blacc has 168 million streams in Pandora but only got $12 000",9/7/1973 21:29
833,833, THat is nothing for those millions. Do you play video games?,3/14/1999 3:08
833,867, I used to play Nintendo until it was discontinued in Japan on 2003.,2/4/2000 20:40
833,833, Yeah. Did you know it only has 54 colors?,10/19/2009 1:57
833,867, Wow only 54 ? Pretty awesome for all the fun that it provided us with,12/5/1984 6:30
833,867, Exactly. Do you know who Bill Nye is?,1/30/2020 1:18
833,867," Yeah that is the science guy, I really liked his show",10/16/1983 17:34
833,867, Hi there do you have an iPhone or an Android?,6/12/2001 2:14
833,833," Hi, I have an iPhone. Do you know when the first one was released?",9/20/1996 8:13
833,833," Yeah that was back on 2007, seems so long ago now",2/14/1998 10:04
833,833," I know it sure does. Among users, women are more likely to own one than men",6/29/1978 7:55
834,926, Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs,8/13/2010 5:56
834,926, Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales,8/24/1970 19:23
834,834, Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven?,10/27/2011 20:06
834,926," I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them ",11/26/2020 20:07
834,926, That is so stupid. When Steve Jobs presented it first he has identical ones hidden because they kept crashing,7/14/2015 14:05
834,926, Yeah it kept running our of ram and that is why it crashed. Those days are over though,3/5/2020 21:53
834,834, They sure are. Do you listen to the radio much?,5/29/1996 15:39
834,834, Yes I listen to Pandora Radio. How about you?,8/24/2021 20:20
834,926, Yes me too. Their net income is $-16 million and the revenue is $274 million,1/26/1975 5:37
834,834, Wow that is so strange. Now they are streaming stand up comedy.,1/29/2012 9:45
835,1254, That is nice they are diversifying their stream. When Swift removed her music from iTunes she still kept it in Pandora,1/31/2008 15:49
835,1254," Maybe that means more of her fans moving over to Pandora, so that is good revenue right there",6/16/1970 1:20
835,835, Yeah that is true. Have you ever played Nintendo?,11/7/2017 2:56
835,1254, I have actually. Did you know it only had 54 colors?,12/5/2011 7:12
835,835, Wow that is it? Too bad it got discontinued in Japan in 2003 though,8/27/1989 2:04
835,835," That  is true, I have some fond memories of it. Do you know who Bill Nye is?",6/28/2007 10:20
835,835, Yeah he is the science guy who got his break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest.,4/8/2011 19:40
835,835, Haha yeah that is pretty cool. Nice chat. ,9/10/2001 21:23
835,1254, Do you think electronic devices are having a negative impact on families?,11/15/2017 17:37
835,835, I think they have some negative impact but they also do a lot of good. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the negative aspects.,9/5/1997 2:20
836,1573, Do you think it's important to use parental controls?,11/3/1986 1:25
836,1573," To an extent, but just to keep harmful stuff that they would be accidentally be exposed to. if I didnt feel my child was mature enough to handle having electronic devices then I would just not let them have them.",10/8/1980 17:21
836,836," Yes, raising kids in the digital age can be tricky, and it is important to encourage them to develop 21st century skills for potential future STEM careers.",5/21/1994 3:46
836,1573, That is true. I think kids are growing up a lot differently than i did. I think it will actually make them smarter because whatever they want to know they can learn it right now. If they want to learn rocket science they can start to learn it on the internet today. It wasnt like that when I was a kid.,4/26/2021 8:39
836,1573," Some people think that screen time should be managed according to content more than limits, such as an ability for parents to switch between educational and entertainment apps.",6/24/2000 8:59
836,836," I think it just depends on the kid. you're not going to get a kid that doesnt care about learning new things to learn new things by trying to make them do it. I mean if all they want to do is facebook with their friends all day then you might have to take the phone away, but I dont think forcing them to read a book or try to learn something will work.",12/28/1993 14:19
836,836, This is an area that probably still needs a lot of collaboration between parents and technology companies in order to develop appropriate tools.,2/26/1979 21:22
836,1573, I agree with you there.,8/12/1974 3:17
836,1573, I have an iPhone that my kids like to steal from me.,2/25/2004 3:53
836,836, Thats funny. Heres another funny one. Did you hear about the send me to heaven game for iphone.,12/25/1977 16:15
837,1273, I did! I wonder if anyone really ever played that! Would not want my kids to play that with my phone!,12/4/2004 8:40
837,1273, No wonder Iphone disabled the app for ecouraging actions that could damage device huh. Lol.,2/29/1984 16:32
837,837," Yeah, you're right! iPhones have come a long way. When Steve Jobs first presented them he had to switch between two iPhones because they would run out of ram and crash.",2/4/2014 13:50
837,837, I heard that microsoft held a funeral for the iphone when they came out with their first device.,6/10/1984 14:57
837,837," Haha, too bad it did not work! iPhone seems healthier than ever!",12/26/2021 6:45
837,1273, I have only had one Iphone before. It was an Iphone 4. I didn't really like it as well as android.,10/4/2002 23:47
837,1273, Do you play games on your phone? I don't really though I used to like to play Nintendo.,1/26/2009 8:42
837,837, Not really anymore. I used to play a few but they all got old. Haven't found any I like yet.,10/18/1991 11:57
837,837, The NES was finally discontinued in September 2003 in Japan. I really liked playing mine!,4/12/2010 20:58
837,837," Hi, are you a tech person?",9/5/2015 19:44
838,838," Hello, somewhat, I enjoy all the advantages!",9/4/2022 9:51
838,838," Me too. I want to know so much more and be better but alas, I cannot.",3/10/2020 14:51
838,1493," Yes, Its very exciting on all the new stuff that will be coming out!!",5/29/2008 12:10
838,838, I was surprised to find out that women own more iphones than men.,6/4/2020 7:58
838,838," Really, I didn't know that! That surprises me, I thought it would be about equal. Iphone's have 75 elements in them.",1/22/2003 1:27
838,838, 75??? Huh... I feel like iphones are older than 12 years. They came out in 2007?,8/5/1988 12:57
838,1493, I did too. Did you know Apple's app store has 2.2 million applications available?,9/25/1982 21:31
838,1493, That's a ton! I wonder how many are actually active as in kept up or updated? How much egg does Microsoft have on it's face for holding a funeral for the iphone?,7/21/2016 4:13
838,838," lol, yes, That was since January 2017. I love my Iphone its with me most of the day, like everyone else. ",10/14/2016 2:19
838,1493, Ditto! I am reading Steve Jobs' biography and man he was a genius but didn't seem very nice. ,11/14/1977 2:46
839,839," lol, I have heard that before. I heard alot of those guys don't want their kids on the phones and ipads. ",2/5/1981 2:01
839,819, I dont either and I am pretty sure I am addicted to the dopamine hit I get everytime I open my phone.,3/14/2005 16:19
839,819," True, Do you listen to Pandora?  I see they have a cap on how much you can listen for free.",2/12/2009 7:55
839,819, I do not any more. I hit that cap and then switched to spotify where I pay for the premium service. Do you like pandora?,12/5/2011 16:07
839,819, I too use spotify! I like it better. Did you know that the NFL is legally considered entertainment than a sport like the WWE.,4/10/1986 5:36
839,819, Really. I had no idea. I wonder why that is?,12/3/1987 15:28
839,839, Must be for legal reasons. I was surprised as well. Who knew? I would say the Iphone holds alot of entertainment!!,10/5/2007 0:50
839,819, So did nintendo. They only had 54 colors!,7/24/1996 3:46
839,819," Yes, I remember that! I didn't realize it had only those few colors. I think I still have it somewhere? lol Good chat!",3/14/1978 20:26
839,839, Ditto. Have a great day!,8/19/2009 12:55
840,295, hey my friend do you like star wars?,4/28/2011 1:32
840,295, Of course!  Chewbacca is my favorite!,4/25/2019 11:05
840,840, yes he's awesome! he's Han Solo's best friend and I always wanted Chewbacca as my friend!,7/22/2001 0:19
840,840, Did you know that various wild animals were used to make his voice?,3/21/1988 18:06
840,295," oh wow I didn't know that, also didn't know that he has a wife and 2 sons, weird!",8/24/1974 5:03
840,295, Chewbacca does?,4/8/1985 20:25
840,840," yup he does haha, also there is a fan theory that Chewy and R2D2 are actually secret rebel agents",3/23/2015 22:43
840,295, Now come on... that's just crazy!!!,5/6/2015 6:57
840,840," ya I know, very screwy, pretty funny that in real life there is a bat species called the chewbacca bat haha",1/3/2018 5:43
840,840, Now i definitely never heard that one before... wonder if it looks like chewie?,11/15/1989 20:57
841,841," ya I want to have a pet bat now! I like that the same actor has appeared as Chewy in all the movies, his name is Peter Mayhew",3/1/1970 21:15
841,1457," Yeah, i did know that and he's like 7 foot 6 inches i believe",4/4/2003 11:04
841,841," yup the dude is huge, do you have Netflix btw? ",10/23/2001 11:52
841,1457, yes i do!  of course :),10/14/2005 20:12
841,1457," oh haha I don't have it, I just watch youtube, but ya can't believe blockbuster had the chance to buy them for only 50 million!",12/15/2017 17:07
841,841, i know... isn't that crazy!  Now there's only one blockbuster store left in the world and it's in alaska,3/4/1978 23:05
841,1457," ya that is sad, and also Netflix is worth like 2 billion, thats a crazy improvement in valuation!",9/18/2005 4:04
841,841, true... but they are so responsible for the streaming movie industry being so huge!,12/14/1977 7:10
841,1457, yup that is true! did you hear the story of how netflix got started?,11/15/2016 12:17
841,1457, actually yes... how he tired of late fees and after a... what... like 40 dollar late fee started netfilx?,12/4/2003 10:08
842,1651," haha yup that's all it took, Reed hasting got that late fee for Apollo 13 and changed history haha",12/29/2002 22:56
842,1651, Yep... great chat... have a good one!,5/24/2003 5:35
842,1651," hi, do you like netflix?",12/15/2002 1:45
842,842, Hello!  I'm a big fan and have had it for years.  What about you?,5/13/1997 11:57
842,1651," yes me too, I have an account. Did you know blockbuster too?",2/23/1974 3:42
842,1651, I used to go to blockbuster until we started using Netflix.  Can you believe that Netflix tried to get Blockbuster to use it's online service and Blockbuster flat out refused?,10/18/2003 8:42
842,1651, Yeah and they mad a bad business decision not buying netflix when they could,5/17/1982 18:31
842,842, Absolutely.  It's so convenient and Blockbuster really missed that.  I wish I could get hired as a tagger to watch Netflix all the time.,4/14/2015 2:31
842,1651, Me too seems like such a sweet gig for sure. Did you know hot netflix got started?,2/4/1999 22:57
842,1651, I'm not sure I do.  I'm anxious to hear how.,12/23/2000 19:54
843,843, Reed Hastings had to play a late fee for a rented vhs and got tired of it,3/16/1972 20:06
843,294, LOL.  When I get a late fee I just end up having to pay for it. What's amazing is that Netflix even managed to secure viewing rights for a number of Star Wars movies.  Are you a fan of that franchise?,3/13/2002 6:18
843,843, I am for sure. Well and now netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america,12/8/1974 2:47
843,294, I'm sure I'll be adding to those bandwidth #s when I start watching those Star Wars films.  Did you know it's actually in the Guinness World Records for it's film merchandising?,8/31/1976 21:42
843,843, Wow that is amazing. do you know Isaac requested that he be a native of planey yavin 4?,11/22/2018 22:19
843,843," That's so cool.  I love those types of things. For instance, the prequel Obi Wan, Ewan McGregor, has a brother who is a pilot and has the call sign Obi Two!",2/27/1982 22:30
843,843, Nice one. Did you know it was the first major movie dubbed in Navajo?,6/20/1985 5:48
843,843, I didn't know that and it's amazing the influence of that movie.  I guess famed director James Cameron was a truck driver and after watching Star Wars decided he was interested in film and quit his job.,8/26/1983 9:17
843,843," Yeah there you go. Lucas' wife won an academy award , do you know what for?",2/7/1972 1:50
843,843, Really?  I am curious to know more about that.,4/5/2009 12:06
844,329, She made changes to the original idea of the star wars and that is how she won,8/23/2000 11:43
844,844, Interesting! I wonder if she had any suggestions about the character Chewbacca.  I'm guessing she didn't or he would likely have got a medal at the end of Star Wars!,7/30/2012 20:17
844,844," Yeah I bet. Back to Netflix, did you know they spend more money on postage than bandwidth?",10/24/1978 20:07
844,329, What is interesting about that is I was a member back when they sent DVDs to your home.  I didn't realize that postage would still be a big thing for them.,6/16/2011 15:24
844,329, Yeah go figure. nice chat.,10/9/1987 0:07
844,329, hello do you like chewbacca from star wars?,10/5/1975 18:07
844,329, Hello. I love Chewie!! I think it's awesome that MTV gave him a lifetime achievement award.,6/12/2008 6:59
844,844," Thats awesome!  Well deserved too,  he has done a lot for the galaxy!  lol I recently learned theres a species of bat called chebacca lol ",2/28/1995 19:28
844,844," Is there really? That is so cool. We were at the Krewe of Chewbacchus parade last year. They really nailed his voice, I don't know if they used recordings of wild animals or not, but they were awesome.",9/13/1989 11:56
844,844, Thats awesome!  Some star wars fans think chewie and r2d2 are rebel agents lol ,1/25/1998 11:45
845,845," lol.  Of course, that makes a lot of sense, since Chewie and Han are so close.",9/27/2008 11:02
845,675, I never knew that chewie has a wife and 2 sons!  Hes a family man lol ,4/29/1988 17:12
845,845," I didn't know that either. Peter Mayhew is an amazing actor, and it was a long time before I realized he played Chewie.",12/15/1988 14:18
845,675," I never knew him until star wars,  what else has he been in?",2/22/1992 21:34
845,675," He was in Dark Towers, back in the 80's and he also voices an animated series, I forget which one. ",8/2/2008 6:56
845,845," Oh I see,  I guess i never seen those. Have you seen the newer star wars movies?  what do you think?",9/17/2008 19:39
845,845," My favorite of the new ones, is Rogue One. I love that movie. I'm glad it's finally on Netflix, I'm getting tired of watching the fireplace when I can't sleep.",12/25/1990 4:03
845,845," I really liked that one Rogue one,  so I have a Nissan Rogue,  and I named it Jyn lol Netflix is great,  watching anything good ?",2/24/1997 0:11
845,675," lol. I really don't watch much of it, my kids are fond of their original program, The Santa Clarita Diet.",12/26/2009 13:17
845,675," Oh I actually like that too,  its really funny.  I love the relationship between the parents,  they are so supportive lol ",3/12/1984 15:22
846,1313," I'm not a fan of Drew Barrymoore, but she is great in that. I've always wondered how you get a job as a tagger for the company. I can watch t.v. all day long, if I have too.",12/22/1982 4:59
846,846, Whats a tagger?,6/19/2004 23:55
846,1313," People who are paid to watch Netflix, and tag content. Kinda like they do on Instagram. Have you seen Lilyhammer? I heard it was good.",1/8/1987 6:05
846,846," No I never knew that,  that is awesome!  I also want that job lol ",12/2/2008 17:41
846,1313," I also want the job of monitoring illegal downloads in Europe, so I can tell Netflix which shows to purchase.",8/1/1987 6:41
846,846, hahaha nice!  Its been great chatting with you. ,7/30/1984 2:49
846,846, Did you know horror movies were originally inspired by literature?,3/21/1988 14:56
846,846," Yeah I think classic authors like Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley inspired the genre. ",10/25/1985 23:08
846,1313," Speaking of horror films, the movie 'Halloween' made $33.3 million at the box office last October. That's crazy!",7/17/2007 5:41
846,846," That is, I think it is really hard to make good horror movies, do you like Stephen King?",9/16/1975 17:45
847,847, I do. Do you know the first movie King was ever scared by was Bambi?,7/30/2017 6:28
847,1793, That is hilarious!  I wonder why he would say that.  ,10/14/1972 2:22
847,847, I feel so happy for Jamie Lee Curtis for the success of Halloween,7/9/1999 6:45
847,847, Yeah I would say that she is the face of that franchise for sure. ,8/13/1982 3:06
847,847," Researchers found that out of 1,100 films from 2007 to 2017, only 30% of the main characters were women",5/7/1984 15:29
847,1793," That is very low, I would figure there would be more.",11/18/1970 2:08
847,847, I heard that Halloween is now the second-biggest opening ever for an R-rated horror movie. Do you know what's first?,11/11/1983 17:31
847,1793," That I don't know, maybe one of the recent ones.  I thought the Shining was good, did you ever see that one?",9/14/2004 2:22
847,847," Yes, I loved it. The boy from The Shining, Danny, actually didn't know he was in a horror movie until later on. ",7/22/1974 17:27
847,847," That's what I heard!  That is too funny, I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was doing?",5/23/1995 8:11
848,848, I guess he thought he was making a drama film. Genres can overlap with each other so maybe it is difficult.,10/22/1996 16:36
848,1790, Yeah that is definitely true.  Do you know what the thing is called that makes all those metallic sounds in horror movies?,1/7/1993 22:32
848,848, They're made by an instrument called a waterphone.,2/27/2015 18:57
848,848," Good call!  Yeah I wonder if that is the only thing they are used for, like more of a prop just for movies. ",6/18/2019 21:58
848,1790," I was wondering the same. With how much money horror films make, it probably isn't needed for anything else.",11/1/2010 1:29
848,848, Yeah they probably just have them waiting in the studio for it. ,8/13/1970 11:09
848,848, I just remembered that Silence of the Lambs made $270 million at the box office when it came out. That movie must've been first  ahead of Halloween.,7/30/2005 6:44
848,848," Holy cow that is a ton of money.  Nice talking with you, i hope you have a good night. ",8/7/2008 2:41
848,848, Hey have you ever seen the movie Halloween? Or even the newest one with Jamie Lee Curtis,7/19/1999 15:40
848,1790, I have not. I like her. But I don't really like horror films. Have you?,5/29/2014 15:43
849,849," No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion",3/9/2012 0:00
849,849," Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you?",1/14/1987 22:18
849,849," Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular",6/25/2008 1:34
849,654, I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky. The comparisons are inevitable.,4/21/1973 6:36
849,654, Yep it's always hard to beat the original. And yes the new Halloween movie is actually being released on the 40th anniversary of the release of the first one,2/5/1997 10:09
849,849, I would rather watch the original. It probably has charm. The new one is probably too slick. ,10/12/2021 17:18
849,849, Yeah I think the original is going to be the best. Did you know that Stephen King actually thinks that the movie Bambi should be a horror movie?,11/27/2011 21:10
849,849," He was traumatized as a child. That movie did have death, so it could be scary. Anyway, he turned his trauma into a career.",5/12/2017 8:16
849,654, Well that's really good for him! Do you think that horror movies actually burn almost 200 calories per movie? If so I should watch more to lose weight LOL,2/4/1999 23:11
849,654," I wonder if the effect wears off. No surprise, no tension. I would rather exercise. By the way, do you like horses?",9/30/1987 3:04
850,850, No I don't like horses I'm actually allergic to them LOL and apparently so is Clint Eastwood,12/28/1975 1:39
850,850, I have never ridden a horse. I would like to. Is it hard? I figure you have to take lessons or something.,6/1/1986 9:00
850,551," Yeah you do have to learn, it's actually very uncomfortable even in a saddle, I think it's cool that Dalmatians were used with firehouses in order to calm the horses back before fire trucks",7/20/1999 10:10
850,850, I've heard that the dogs were deaf. I wonder if that's true.,8/8/1998 12:19
850,850," I think some Dalmatians are born deaf but not all of them are, what do you think about the high school students who rode horses to school? The high school had a no vehicle policy at the time, and so they rode horses instead lol",7/30/2008 7:55
850,850," I think they were cheeky for doing so, but I admire their chutzpah.",10/31/1985 2:39
850,551," Yep I can admire that, I would never have done that as a kid haha. It's interesting that Clint Eastwood was not always allergic to horses but developed it once he hit midlife",3/15/1980 9:33
850,551," I don't think I have an allergy to them. Anyway, great chat!",1/25/2020 0:45
850,850, Well don't spend too much time around horses just in case you develop a allergy to them LOL I wish I didn't have the allergy,5/7/2004 6:39
850,551, Do you have children?,9/14/1978 3:12
851,955," No I do not, how about you?",4/15/1987 5:38
851,851, I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time.,6/1/1995 10:47
851,851, Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on? ,5/10/1993 7:37
851,955," He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid.",2/5/2003 11:48
851,851, There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet. ,3/6/1973 11:05
851,851," I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones.",5/9/1982 22:01
851,955," That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen. ",9/19/1981 20:55
851,851," He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop.",4/4/2022 3:00
851,851, It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways. ,4/8/1999 20:09
851,955," Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore.",4/18/1972 19:46
852,85, Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence. ,2/26/1983 2:19
852,852," His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes?",9/2/1982 19:20
852,85, Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage? ,6/2/1985 12:27
852,85," He's growing like he's getting paid for it! Every weekend we are going through his clothes and getting rid of what is too small! Especially pants and long sleeve shirts, he has long legs and arms.",6/13/2021 17:08
852,85," Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once. ",9/19/2001 10:00
852,85," We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it.",11/12/1990 1:46
852,85," That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time.",12/5/2021 0:43
852,85," I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned.",6/2/1972 8:49
852,852, I know thrift store typically had a lot of nicer things for women but you're right the men's selections seems to be lacking. It seems like once a man is fully grown and gets a good suit they never let it go ,5/28/1985 12:22
852,852," Absolutely, my husband has had the same sport's coat for years!",10/20/1974 20:43
853,149," I'm a little envious, seems like women are expected to swap out a new dress for each even. ",7/24/2007 19:41
853,853," Yeah, women definitely get the short end of the stick as far as clothing goes!",6/5/1976 11:00
853,149, Do you have kids that are around 10 or past that?,4/19/1977 5:31
853,149," I have teens, thankfully both went through puberty without turning into monsters.",4/20/1998 3:43
853,149, I've have 3 kids that are adults now.  I don't remember this monster thing.  I think I'm reading the exploits of a snowflake millennial. ,4/14/2002 10:08
853,853," Mine are gen Z, (early 2000), so I don't have any experience with the 90's millennials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in the 90's?",6/3/1975 6:29
853,853," Yes I did.  If this parent need a box of wine for 10  year olds, he/she is in for a big surprise. ",3/13/2001 6:19
853,853," Meh, it's a blog. They tend to exaggerate for social media. I would love to go to the unclaimed luggage store in Alabama. Maybe I could find mine from several years ago.",7/24/1978 10:02
853,853," Yeah but I don't like it when people make it look like kids are a huge problem even if it's for their own attention.  Yeah, I probably have luggage somewhere in ATL. ",11/17/2021 4:31
853,149," If anything, all that does is show your lack of parenting skills...and alcohol problem.",8/21/2020 5:49
854,568," Yeah, like that's a good solution -- getting lit. Funny, polo shirts should actually be called tennis shirts because a tennis player invented them.",11/22/2010 21:18
854,568, I prefer the office attire of Hawaii. Suits and ties are too stifling in that heat.,10/8/1995 20:42
854,568, Amen to that.  Or maybe a colorful wardrobe full of Pilgrim clothes?  The Pilgrims got a bad rap for always wearing black.  Not true...,5/2/1976 12:11
854,568, I like the uniform at Billy Mays' funeral. Blue shirts and khaki pants were what the pallbearers were wearing. May as well be comfortable.,4/21/2004 16:27
854,568," Yes, that's cool.  It's going to be OK to wear flip-flops at mine.  I'm a noted tie-hater...",4/7/2010 3:36
854,854, Are you familiar with the theory that the universe is one giant hologram?,11/13/1999 7:36
854,854," Yes, I'm an engineer that wishes he was and astrophysicist.  It's also wild that there may be a region of space that's pulling galaxy's outside the observable universe.  ",7/4/2015 19:50
854,854, I think it's fascinating that there are stars cold enough to touch.,4/13/1970 17:21
854,568, Does that mean cold fusion is for real?  Some think that there is only one electron in the universe.  That one hell of an electron. ,5/4/1987 2:21
854,568," I think it might be, makes you wonder what needs to be revisited in space, or at least give Tycho Brahe & Johannes Kepler a read.",4/13/1996 14:51
855,1558, Huge fans of them as I am of Newton.  We lost most of the universe recently in that we don't know what dark matter and dark energy is - it is most of the universe and we can't see it. ,6/10/2015 20:51
855,855, Newton built upon Copernicus' works. I need to revisit all of them.,7/22/1990 1:01
855,1558," I admire their accomplishments.  Thanks, you've been a great chat partner! ",10/12/1981 9:16
855,855, hi how are you? Do you use youtube?,7/3/2012 5:04
855,855," I do, daily, how about you?",11/22/2003 13:02
855,1558, I use it a lot. i listen to old songs and jazz albums. what do you tube on YouTube?,11/2/1987 9:43
855,855, I mostly watch videos about investing and finance,7/15/1998 15:16
855,855, That is great! a chance to study and learn. i think youtube is a great learning tool!,4/25/2000 17:41
855,1558," yeah, its a great learning tool for sure. Which old songs do you like the most on youtube? 60's 70's 80's 90's?",1/27/1972 7:31
855,1558," 70s and 80s, though jazz from the 60s. what about you? what music would you listen to?",3/9/1989 0:47
856,882, I grew up in the 70's and 80's and I still listen to the music from those decades. ,9/14/1998 13:44
856,882," Yeah, great pop and rocks tunes. I enjoy taking YouTube back on a tour of the past.",4/18/1971 21:44
856,882, yeah I like watching the old comics from that era also. They were way more free then and didnt need to be so PC.,3/7/2016 9:46
856,882," Yeah, they could take more risks, but i guess they were risks at the time. i dont like censorship. i would like youtube to put up warnings but leave the content there.",5/21/1993 10:52
856,882, Yeah seems like today everyone is so easily offended.,5/7/1999 1:43
856,856," Yeah, well, there is power in sanctimony. WHAT DID YOU SAY??? Im offended!!! LOL",3/17/1979 18:37
856,856," yeah, I reckon it pays to be a victim. I did not know that police have their own youtube called bluetube",11/14/2016 7:26
856,856, I guess they trade tips on Blutube? I would love to watch. ,11/15/1985 9:10
856,882, yeah probably some good ones on blutube.,4/8/1972 12:25
856,882," the latest weapons, armor, drugs, and vehicles. gangs and stuff. lots of fun. good for writing a screenplay.",6/26/1983 23:44
857,857, Have you tried Youtube music or TV? wondering what others think of it.,9/3/1990 2:15
857,857," I usually just listen to music on Youtube. i sometimes watch documentaries. Anyway, great chat!",10/1/2000 0:24
857,82, You too! have a good weekend,7/26/1976 16:36
857,857, Have a good weekend too!,8/3/1970 18:22
857,82, thanks,8/3/2010 9:08
857,82," Hello. Did you know there is a violin made of stone, and it is actually playable?",4/5/2022 5:00
857,857," Never heard of that. Wonder if it has 4 strings, like normal violins?",1/12/2019 14:30
857,857," I would imagine so. Larry (three stooges fame) also played, I guess he was very good.",6/6/2007 2:01
857,857," Heard he burned an arm as a child, and violion lessons helped strengthen damaged nerves. Was he good?",5/17/2008 15:25
857,82," If WWI hadn't happened, I guess we would have found out, as he was headed to a music school",4/29/2010 13:37
858,723," I see. Same era: Einstein, already a famous physicist, also played violin exceptionally well.",11/7/2007 13:28
858,858," My daughter has a poster of him above her bed, with the quote The Greatest Scientists Are Artists As Well. She says its inspiration for both her art and music.",4/7/2015 3:25
858,858," That's great. Have you ever read or seen the film based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason book, The Four Feathers?",7/9/1980 7:12
858,858," I have not. Is it the one that the judge tried to ban, due to featuring a black character?",4/23/1984 15:14
858,723," Good question. I don't know, but since much of the story is based in the Middle East during 1880's conflicts there, some Arab characters are featured. Could they have been called moors - or black?",3/6/2013 4:34
858,723," I'm not sure, as I've never read it. I'm more of a sci-fi fan, and love that Poe had a cyborg in one of his stories.",6/12/2017 15:58
858,858," Edgar Allen, yes. Still re-read his Cask of Amontilliado story and the poem, The Raven. Ahead of his time, that writer!",11/30/2010 20:13
858,723, Have you checked out the wiki that ranks all of the fictional characters according to their powers and abilities?,11/6/1992 1:25
858,858," No, but interesting feature. Did you know that powerful ruler (for real), Julius Caesar even wrote fiction?",8/27/2009 17:35
858,723, I heard something about him writing about hercules. Have you read it?,4/13/2015 11:56
859,859, Not Caesar's fan fiction. Hercules and Oedipus are main heroes in Greek epics; Caesar would have known about them.,3/1/1975 16:15
859,1270," I haven't read much of that, I mainly read travel guides, as I travel a lot. I'm hoping to get to Macinac Island this summer, and bike around the island.",1/21/1985 9:52
859,1270," Understand that it is a lovely, slow-paced place. Try a horse-drawn carriage there! Have you, like Caesar, ever been to Greece, through Italy, to Germany or England - or elsewhere in Europe?",9/28/1977 3:58
859,1270," I have been to Iceland, it's expensive as I had to travel by plane between towns.",1/10/2016 0:09
859,1270, My son had a stop in Iceland on route to Australia. Wants to go back for a real visit. Understand they have no public rail service there. Too many volcanos and other impassable terrain??,4/8/2002 22:48
859,859," It's a rough terrain, I would love to go back, and am trying to find a cheap flight to Japan (on Iceland Air) for a layover. Japans highways are toll, so it's expensive to travel there.",8/22/2019 12:48
859,1270," Yes, Americans would not accept tolls on all our highways, like the Japanese do. Heard to go across Japan you can expect to pay $300 or more...ouch!",9/11/1978 10:58
859,859," It is very expensive. Thanks for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.",3/16/2012 16:13
859,1270, Hello - how are you today?,1/28/2007 12:01
859,859, I am great! So do you pay attention to politics at all?,6/2/2001 8:04
860,860, I do. What about you?,9/15/1979 17:11
860,860, I didn't used to pay a lot of attention but I do now. The country is a crazy place lately. ,8/26/1990 9:06
860,800, I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853.,6/5/1993 8:18
860,800," Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird",1/1/1971 0:14
860,800, Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats.,12/1/1998 15:49
860,860," That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that.",1/9/1990 16:43
860,800, Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats.,11/16/2008 22:55
860,860, Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans. I agree in that because I don't identify as either.,1/3/1970 19:25
860,860, Did you know Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons one time?,10/2/2011 12:13
860,800," Oh, wasn't that about trying to stop them from parodying the anti democratic agenda?",2/11/1974 14:15
861,861, Possibly lol. Do you like YouTube?,10/2/1978 2:15
861,861, I love Youtube....I am always looking there or Google to do so many things!,10/31/2006 8:38
861,861, I watch YouTube daily. YouTube is the second largest search engine on the internet.,7/2/1988 1:21
861,861, That doesn't surprise me. I didn't know this but YouTube operates as one of Googles subsidiaries ...Google bought Youtube for over a billion dollars!,10/12/2007 7:41
861,1638, I didn't know that either. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet usage in North America.,12/8/2017 15:13
861,1638," Wow, that is huge. I like how the police have their own youtube called blutube lol...pretty smart!",3/31/1994 5:40
861,1638, That is very smart. ,10/15/2022 7:38
861,1638, I wish we would have had Google and Youtube back in my day it would have been so easy to research and get through school.Kids have no idea how easy having the internet is to help them through so much with info. ,2/15/1991 15:22
861,1638, It was great talking to you!,5/10/2012 12:08
861,861," Hello, do you like to travel?",7/1/1981 14:23
862,1861," yes, i love to travel. You?",8/12/1986 18:27
862,1861," Awesome,  yes I like to travel too.  I wish we had those high speed buses that the dutch are making,  it travels like 160 mph.",8/20/2018 17:55
862,862, it would indeed be a great pleasure to ride a bus like to work. it would save me so much time!,5/4/1989 13:54
862,862," Yeah,  and when you ride the bus you can get stuff done too,  instead of driving. ",2/25/1975 4:08
862,862," yes, i think that i would be way more productive on the dutch bus. i should move to holland.",6/19/2005 22:05
862,862," Yes, that would be better than moving to Japan,  I guess it costs like $300 in tolls to cross the country. ",11/2/1986 15:33
862,1861," Yes, japan is far too expensive for most people. i think that it would be good to avoid japan and its expensive highways",12/26/2008 7:53
862,1861," I'm going next Feb.,  so I will avoid driving there lol ",11/5/1975 6:14
862,1861, you could take the train there. they have many trains that go around the country.,9/30/1981 13:02
862,1861," Awesome!  Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun. ",10/30/1982 17:27
863,863," yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it.",7/15/1992 9:14
863,863, The first king to travel around the world was the king of hawaii.,9/17/2021 20:42
863,863, he must have had a hankering to see the world and understand other peoples and cultures. i admire his sense of adventure and curiosity.,7/10/1985 5:11
863,863," Yeah I wonder when he did that,  I cant remember a time where Hawaii had a king lol",7/25/2020 11:14
863,863," I think it was King Kamehameha. he was the last king, i believe.",8/9/1983 16:43
863,1402," I see.  I hear Iceland has no public rail service,  most natives fly across the country.",7/5/1975 15:44
863,863, that makes sense. iceland is very small and perhaps the terrain is not good for rail. planes could be very convenient.,7/19/2008 2:19
863,1402, I hope its not expensive to fly if people have to constantly do it. ,3/6/2019 8:17
863,1402," yes, they might have high speed buses too. that would be a hoot. LOL Anyway, great chat! ",12/15/2019 6:26
863,1402," Wonderful chat,  thank you so much! ",1/22/2013 9:56
864,864, Do you like the travel?,5/3/2016 9:44
864,864," Yes, I love to travel! How about you?",1/22/2006 2:44
864,864," Me too, I am planning a trip right now for Brazil! I can't wait. Have you traveled out of the country?",12/29/1993 8:05
864,1196," Yes, I have traveled a lot! I even went to iceland last summer.",11/9/1985 21:24
864,1196," Nice, that is my future plan, I love the looks of that place. Is it true about their rail system not being there?",2/8/1989 8:51
864,1196," I think it is! I heard without cars, they use domestic flights to travel.",7/13/1985 22:01
864,864," That is interesting, it certainly helps people getting over their fear of flying lol. I wonder if it is because of the terrain",8/7/2017 4:05
864,864, I am not sure. But I do know it is very cheap to travel.,6/25/1973 4:47
864,864," That is awesome, at least they make it cheap. Have you been to mackinac island in MI?",8/20/2003 6:57
864,1196," No, I have not. I heard they don;t have vehicles.",9/30/2009 1:58
865,300," I heard that too. That would be rough, but at least you would get in shape on vacation lol. Or ride horses.",1/10/2001 10:13
865,865," Very true, you would need a horse-drawn carriage or even a bike to get around.",9/24/1983 14:18
865,300, That would be interesting. It would be more relaxing I think in my opinion. Maybe they will bring the bus from the Dutch that goes 160 mph!,2/19/1987 1:48
865,865, I wonder if people get dizzy looking out of the window.,8/18/1980 16:30
865,300," I bet, or fear for their lives as they are traveling in a bus going that fast",10/23/2021 9:17
865,300, True. Have you heard about the tolls in japan?,11/5/1997 2:32
865,300," I have, there worse than Chicago's and I never thought that was possible. I don't know how bad they are though",12/8/1983 1:50
865,300, I heard it costs more than $300 to travel across the country. ,4/22/2013 10:17
865,300," That is expensive, wow! Probably worth it, but still! It was so nice chatting with you!",9/28/1997 20:01
865,300, It was nice talking to you too. I am going to go look into some new places to travel too.,12/16/1976 7:08
866,472, Me too! Enjoy your day!,5/4/1992 12:17
866,866, Hi! Have you ever had to deal with kids going through puberty?,11/12/2015 21:47
866,472, It very difficult to handle. Mostly they playing games and not focused on studies.,1/28/1982 18:54
866,866," I agree. It can cause a lot of anxiety for a parent. Kids get very emotional at that age, and they will argue about anything, even what clothes they wear.",1/24/2000 6:52
866,472, They need mobiles and want to spent the money in the unwanted things. Mostly they are uncomfortable with their studies and teacher. It is very very difficult to handle this situation. They need bike also without drinving license.,3/10/2012 1:56
866,866, How do you think parents should handle them when they are like this? It is sometimes hard to talk to them about it.,7/18/2010 14:40
866,472," In the kid itself we must follow the rule and regulation, if they enter into puberty it is easy to handle them otherwise, the situation is very worst.",7/27/2003 9:30
866,866, Discipline is a good idea. It can help them get used to behaving well even when they are going through puberty and feeling so many emotions.,3/14/2014 20:59
866,472," Firstly, we want to be patience and talk to them very polite and spend time with them when ever we are free. while talking with them we make them comfortable.",1/15/2008 6:09
866,472, That is a great idea. Teaching them that we care about them can help them feel like we understand them. Being polite will make us a good example for them too.,2/4/2000 1:31
867,1986, They always copy all the habit from their parents only. They are real heroes.,8/28/1978 8:42
867,867," Parents who love their children and raise them right are heroes. It is not easy to deal with children when they are going through puberty, but we all have to do it.",12/31/1998 0:30
867,1986, We should try our best. All in the hands of god only.,12/26/2006 18:07
867,1986, Following the example of god is probably a good way to think about raising children. Patience and love will help both parents and kids get through it.,6/2/2002 7:28
867,1986, Yes. Love can change anything in the world. We must be patience too.,2/28/2005 4:06
867,1986, I think that it helps to see children grow up after you have cared for them. It feels like a reward to help them and then see them become wonderful adults.,2/16/1983 22:58
867,1986, Its our duty to make them good human and want to serve the society.,3/9/1992 12:48
867,867," That's true. Children are the future of society, so raising them to be good people will make the world a better place.",12/29/1993 12:00
867,867," In olden days, clothing is refers to cover the body from the sun rays and insects. But now days it was more fashionable.",6/20/1996 14:58
867,1986, Clothing is a good thing to talk to kids about too. I also love to shop for clothing for myself. I like comfortable clothes that look good the best.,1/28/2004 11:48
868,868, You prefer online shopping or went to purchase ?,9/27/2008 19:44
868,1984," I like to go in person to purchase so I can try things on. I still like to look around online, though.",5/1/2001 14:52
868,868, Do you have or have had  kids in that challenging stage of puberty entering. ,12/29/1980 1:34
868,868," No, I do not have kids but my parents said that I was tough to deal with in this stage. I was not a well behaved kid. What about you?",2/26/1978 20:59
868,1984," I have 3 adult kids.  Only one was a real challenge.  As a parent, it's easy to feel like a failure during this phase.",3/17/1983 13:22
868,1984, Did they want all the newest clothing because when I was a kid I made my mom buy me really nice shirts.,3/15/2021 10:48
868,1984," My daughter did, not so much with my sons.  Sometimes when as a parent or husband, it's better just to walk of and regroup. ",8/27/2000 0:06
868,868," I would make her buy me shirts that cost 100 or more. Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg the facebook Ceo, wear plain grey T-shirts that cost 300 or 400$",9/18/1991 15:51
868,1984," That's nuts.  Mine cost less than $10.  You want nice things for your kids but when it gets ridiculous, stand your ground and don't doubt yourself. ",4/7/2017 10:55
868,868," I really like nice clothing, clothing has always been something people love. Did you know that The greeks made asbestos clothing and it was as valuable as gold.",8/7/2006 15:57
869,869," Sounds itchy... I think it's funny that Pilgrims wore colorful clothes, not just black. Stereotypes... I bet they didn't eat turkey all the time either.  ",9/21/1973 6:39
869,869," It amazing how traditions get passed along, I even heard about an african tribe that wears victorian cloths because german occupiers they saw.",1/18/2020 2:02
869,869, Interesting.  It's also interesting that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player Lacoste nicknamed the gator.,10/22/1998 6:36
869,869, I feel like people just follow others in their beliefs. Do you belive Isaac Newton and his law of Gravity?,1/28/1985 17:10
869,1754, I'm with Einstein in that it isn't a force like Newton says but rather the curvature of space.,2/11/1974 16:48
869,1754, Do you think the earth is moving  and flying through space at 500k mph. I have heard new ideas about a motionless round earth with maybe even a dome. Did you know they say the universe makes sounds,6/18/2018 15:14
869,869, We haven't had such ideas since Copernicus.  I thought that was put to bed.  People think what they want like the folks that think the universe is one big superhologram. ,3/23/1988 18:12
869,869," I think our best scientist know less than 1 percent of what there is to know. Some say we all could just be inside of a black whole. I think there is another dimension, like when people take DMT",1/31/1976 11:17
869,1754, That 1% may be a generous estimate.  We've recently lost most of the universe with the unknowns of  dark matter and energy.  There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. ,8/29/1970 8:47
869,869," It would be crazy if there is parallel universe, some say there is a cold spot they think could be a link to this universe. Sometimes I think space is all made up. If we are spinning so fast how can the water stay still but that same force can not hold down a butterfly. seems like one big joke sometimes.",11/19/1994 3:06
870,870, Interesting.  I wonder if somewhere some aliens are wearing polo shirts?  ,10/30/2012 22:01
870,870," I think they are watching us at all times, those sneaky aliens. I wonder if when an alien goes through puberty it is as tough as us humans",11/22/1990 8:01
870,1530, Hee.  I suspect that it is.  You've been an excellent chat partner! Thanks. ,10/21/2001 14:29
870,1530," Hi, how are you on this fine evening?",7/20/1997 8:35
870,870," hi I'm doing great how about you, did you know Julius Caesar would write fan fiction when he was young, It was about hercules haha",3/24/1977 21:43
870,870, I'm with George RR Martin on this issue. Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar!,5/2/1970 23:57
870,870, haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction,10/24/1980 14:01
870,870," Hercules never understood copyright law! Poe wasn't perfect, but he knew sci fi.",8/31/1993 17:43
870,870," haha I didn't know that, what did he do?",9/23/1995 21:04
870,1530, He married a gal that was like 13 or something. I guess in his day that was not unusual but still. Probably to an author and alcoholic these were normal things.,12/9/2014 2:21
871,320," ah I see well that is definitely weird, what I'm not surprised with is there is a wikipedia that ranks fictinoal characters, it does it according to their abilities, I'll tell you some people have a lot of time on their hands",3/19/2008 8:14
871,320," I think that some people live for such things! They get notoriety from such endeavors, but no money. Can you believe that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character? That's an amazing judgement.",12/19/2014 4:11
871,320," that is pretty bad for sure, what I want to see is the violin made of stone that you can actually play, I play the piano do you play any instruments",8/27/2013 18:10
871,320," I used to play the guitar, but I weren't any good. I would blow hard into it, but it never sounded quite right. Perhaps I should have tried the violin, but I mistook it for a form of violence.",9/22/1990 7:00
871,871," haha I like that, ya my uncle plays the violin but he says its really hard to learn, the piano isn't that bad in my opinion, it has a good amount of challenge but I think anyone can get pretty good with enough practice",10/21/2018 12:06
871,871," I would like to think that I could be as good as Einstein. He was a musician, but he didn't really gain renown as one. I could do as well as him, don't you think?",9/13/1977 6:22
871,871," ah I didn't know that, well I think you can do it! just make sure to use modern violins and not the million dollar stradivarius ones, modern ones sound better in blind tests",3/16/2015 4:51
871,320," I would never be able to tell the difference. Perhaps Einstein could, but I couldn't. If Haydn wrote a competition with the two varieties of violin ar the end, could the audience tell the difference?",3/13/1991 17:21
871,320," haha good question, what is cool that Einstein said is that the greatest scientists are artists as well",3/24/2008 2:06
871,871," But then again, are the greatest artists scientists? Perhaps not. Or perhaps so. Perhaps I don't know. I want to hear a violin made out of stone, a piano made out of stone for the Flintstones.",2/20/2002 21:53
872,872," haha I like that, would you ride a bus that goes 160mph? they are making on in Denmark apparently",1/13/2015 9:24
872,1373," The Danes are seditious, don't trust them! They lie! They eat too much butter! Anyhows, great chatting with you!",4/18/1999 6:21
872,872," haha those lying butter eaters! great talking with you, stay away from japanese highways they are apparently all toll roads!",5/9/2022 5:21
872,1373, The pastries in Denmark are dangerously addictive!,8/27/1972 23:15
872,872," yes that is my dream, to be in denmark, going 160mph in a bus eating pastries!",8/31/2020 14:54
872,1373, Hi there. Do you enjoy to travel? I love visiting distant geographical locations!,7/22/2022 20:38
872,872," Yes, I was actually in Paris last week. Do you travel? I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover.",6/20/2004 3:40
872,1373, Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car.,8/17/1996 12:08
872,872," No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work.",12/28/2004 7:54
872,872, Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there.,11/18/1975 16:13
873,848," No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time.",8/17/2008 8:17
873,848, Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact.,8/30/1990 2:43
873,848," Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined robotics I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like?",11/11/2019 12:08
873,848, Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool. ,10/21/2014 6:28
873,873," Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time.",8/2/1997 1:56
873,848, Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text.,9/15/2002 1:05
873,848," Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound.",4/27/2007 13:38
873,873, You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone!,2/22/1979 1:39
873,873," Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same.",1/2/2003 5:15
873,873, Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein.,5/20/1976 7:53
874,94," Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and break-in a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body.",12/9/1979 21:20
874,94, Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting. It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands. Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges!,1/15/1994 11:05
874,874," That funny, yes, you like me must have a few years on you. My kids don't know who the Three Stoogies are. Have you traveled much? Back to that, you see where the airlines make the walk longer instead of baggage return quicker to cut complaints. That not good to me.",2/16/1971 19:17
874,94, Yes I have lived in both Spain and Australia. I actually didn't hear about that. Typically airplane if is the most efficient method of travel when compared with everything else so I don't see why they make people walk longer. ,12/17/2010 8:27
874,94," Nice, my son went to school a summer in Spain. He loved it. I guess the exercise you get on the longer walk is good. Did you know they fly 10% slower to save fuel relative to the 60's, that would be fine but the food is worse than the 60's too.",8/25/1975 17:36
874,874," Yeah good point. I remember the days when everyone got free meals and they were actually legit. Still given all that flying definitely beats train, boat, and bus travel! Nice chatting with you!",1/11/1982 20:23
874,874, Good morning! How are you today?,1/18/1981 0:53
874,874, I'm doing good! What about you? Do you like to listen to music?,6/11/2003 6:40
874,94," I'm going well too! I do listen to music, how about you?",7/20/1982 8:35
874,874," Yes, me too. I like to listen to jazz from time to time. There;'s even a woman in Harlem that has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Saturday for 20 years.",9/10/1977 5:06
875,875, Wow I wonder how many people show up? I like how Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that tops the charts!,4/17/1993 2:17
875,1978," I'm not sure how many show up, but I guess top performers occasionally stop by.",12/11/1977 4:13
875,1978, Do you think Clint Eastwood ever did? He is a lifelong jazz enthusiast!,1/14/2005 4:49
875,1978," Boy, I'm not sure. I know he scored several films including Million Dollar Baby.",12/1/2015 9:22
875,875," that is so cool! Next time I watch a jazz band, I'm going to see if the trumpeters have goatees!",2/29/2004 3:55
875,1978, Are goatees popular among jazz trumpeters?,2/18/1983 15:50
875,875, Yes it provides them comfort when playing the trumpet!,7/18/1995 5:34
875,1978," Oh, that is interesting Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that tops the charts?.",11/7/2016 3:51
875,875, That is interesting! But you know what is more interesting? The sun lol.,2/2/2021 1:57
875,875, Yes! Did you know the sun is actually white?,12/13/1999 0:09
876,876, I didn't know that! We've been taught the wrong thing all of these years! I do know that the sun isn't the biggest start in our galaxy!,11/10/2010 14:49
876,461," Well, I guess we perceive the sun as yellow because of atmospheric scattering.",4/29/2010 14:44
876,461, That makes total sense to me! I feel like we are spoiled when it comes to the sun's energy!,11/19/1983 0:41
876,461," Yes, the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.",3/31/2016 10:11
876,876, That is crazy to think! Are you into reading fiction? Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg! How do people come up with these ideas!,1/20/1981 13:12
876,461, A little bit. I know there's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.,12/9/1987 10:59
876,876," I am going to go look into that right now. It was nice chatting, have a great day!",5/27/2011 3:01
876,461, Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),2/19/2017 4:32
876,461, Hello! Good i just read some really interesting stuff about Jazz music. Did you know it started in the great city of New Orleans?,2/7/1973 6:51
876,461," Yes, I believe I was aware of that fact. Are You a jazz lover ?",2/11/2020 18:59
877,137, I am! It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today.,11/20/2019 9:07
877,137, Yes sir... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician...,4/7/1977 19:24
877,877, Yes it is truly something. I have heard that New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s.,3/1/1985 4:30
877,877," That I'm not sure about... don't know the exact date, but I always wondered how a music style begins... it's not like a guy is sitting on it's porch and thinks... I'm going to invent new music style and I'll call it JAZZ :)",1/5/1986 20:58
877,137, Haha! Yeah i have always wondered things like that. But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who knew huh?,7/5/1995 0:11
877,137, I can believe that... he is a classy Dude ;) I don't imagine him listening to disco or rap ;),8/6/2018 22:18
877,137, Yeah he just does not seem like the guy that would be into that. But I think more people love jazz than we know A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years.,8/11/1975 16:51
877,877, I'm sure there were a lot of enthusiasts of that ! Sounds like a good woman ,3/14/1974 23:59
877,877, Yeah what kind of stuff is on your mind that you would like to talk about?,5/21/1998 7:02
877,137, You know Edgar allen poe poetry ?,12/22/1999 10:19
878,866, I am he was a fiction writer correct?,6/1/2013 23:33
878,866, Yes - really dark poetry sometimes -  He wrote wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Pretty interesting ! ;),2/11/1981 19:43
878,878," Yeah he was a special kinda person, If i recall he was the person who also wrote the poem about  the raven crying nevermore.",1/6/2005 1:18
878,866, Yes I think You're right. Some of his poems were used in Nightmare on Elm street ;),8/26/1983 21:41
878,878, Really I had no idea. I wonder how they implemented them in the film?,1/7/1997 4:38
878,878," Those were right before the movie began. Something about dreams - You know, movie related :)",3/22/1998 23:11
878,878, I have not seen those movies in a very long time so it is all kinda blurry to me. But I think I might have to go back and check them out again.,6/4/1992 8:59
878,866, I remember seeing them as a little boy... I was terrified but excited !,9/2/1982 18:39
878,878, Yeah I bet those older movies took lots of inspiration from poes work.,6/27/1981 21:12
878,866, A text before the opening credits starts reads as follows: Sleep. Those little slices of Death. How I loathe them -Edgar Allan Poe- ( I found it ! ) :),6/8/1974 19:22
879,879, That is really cool! What one is that from the first one you said?,1/23/1984 15:59
879,879," DO you like Jazz ? There is a lot of people who like Jazz, like Clint Eastwood. ",4/12/2009 15:43
879,879," Yes, Jazz is an art form that has been around a long time. It originated in African- American communities in the late 19th, early 20th century.",2/2/1991 12:25
879,879," Yeah, it is a recent art, it started to be recognized as an official music current  in the 1920s.  ",6/28/2004 2:07
879,879, There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment for 20 years!,12/19/2001 1:21
879,879, I wonder if her neighbors liked it. It must have been noisy. ,6/4/1980 5:00
879,566," I am sure they enjoyed when the top performers came over, would be a treat.",12/26/1976 13:41
879,879,"  It must have drawn a crowd, a crowded apartment is quite noisy.   ",1/7/2018 14:04
879,879," Yes, jazz is also big worldwide, a Pakistani jazz orchestra is topping the charts.",4/16/1988 0:24
879,879, Would you like it if your neighbor held a jazz concert every Sunday ? ,8/31/2000 23:51
880,1859," It would depend on how far they are and the noise level, not in close proximity with loud noise.",9/5/1983 22:14
880,880," It is an apartment, so there would a wall between you and the concert. ",3/2/1997 21:52
880,880," Guess the only way to know is to attend and see what it's like. Did you know that Neptune made a full orbit in 2011, the first since being discovered?",9/29/1985 16:13
880,1859," Yeah, the solar system is quite peculiar, the sun represent 99.86 of all mass in the solar system. Knowing, that losing weight seems futile in the scheme of the universe. ",9/29/2003 17:54
880,880," Yes we are a cosmic dust ball haha, the largest star in our galaxy is 1 billion times bigger.",5/29/2000 13:37
880,1859," There is so much that we cannot grasp about the universe until we now enough science, like the sun is white, it is yellow because of our atmosphere.",1/29/1999 15:11
880,880," Yep, and a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the surface of the sun, crazy!",2/23/1994 0:17
880,1859, Yeah it is surprising that something on Earth could be hotter than the sun. ,5/4/1994 11:56
880,1859," I know right, what do you think about fiction?",5/12/1984 5:05
880,880," I love fiction, I read a lot of stories but I don't write any , unlike Julius Ceasar who wrote stories about Hercules and Oedipus. ",9/16/2010 9:04
881,1393," Basically fan fiction, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction though, but fan fiction may have to finish Game of Thrones at his writing rate.",5/12/1994 19:16
881,1393, He could use lawsuits to stop them since his work is copyrighted. Have a nice evening. ,10/17/2014 5:05
881,1393," Hey how is it going today, have you heard of the axe-murderer in New Orleans by chance? Scary!",7/31/2010 13:24
881,881," I  did, I thought that was a terrifying story as well, King Zeno, sure seems like a scary piece",3/30/2008 0:08
881,1393," That would be scary to see that guy for sure, it sounds as if he had PTSD, this was apparently a while ago but still, mental health should have been treated a lot better then!",5/29/1984 23:15
881,881," I know right, I wonder if its based on real life events? King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone",8/19/2004 0:49
881,1393," For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music?",12/7/1977 21:55
881,1393," I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre",8/7/1975 21:39
881,881," Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz. What other kind of music do you like?",6/22/1993 7:48
881,1393," It has deep roots that go almost a hundred years ago, it means a lot to many people, nice tunes and melody",3/5/1988 10:40
882,888," For sure, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan, which is pretty surprising to be honest given his previous roles.",8/13/1997 17:02
882,888," Really his a fan? well he has great musical taste then, I hear Pakistan has a great Jazz orchestra",2/22/2016 12:02
882,888, I would never have guessed that. Have you ever noticed that a lot of jazz trumpeters have goatees? Apparently it is to provide comfort while they play.,10/27/2005 15:55
882,882, Ive always wondered about those out of style goatees I guess it makes sense to grow them if its for comfort however weird they look,6/15/2012 12:34
882,888," True, it'd be tough to be playing it for so long without anything there I am assuming. You a big fiction or non-fiction fan?",12/7/2005 21:16
882,882," I prefer fiction and just let my imagination fly, do you have a favorite author?",8/18/2017 6:02
882,882," Not really, I would like to check out some Julius Caesar though, he apparently wrote fan fiction about Hercules, would be neat to read that.",7/3/2013 19:51
882,888," That sounds like a great piece of literature, I like George RR Martin, I bet he would dislike the works of Ceasar",10/8/2015 4:06
882,882," It'd be really interesting to just read it, that's almost 2000 years of difference but the same story being told. It's so sad that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a comic because it featured a black character, what an embarassment.",4/12/2004 17:18
882,882," I know right, luckily times have changed but that kind of behavior makes me really angry, ",11/18/2021 8:59
883,97," Me too, it's terrible to think about people being so willfully ignorant, they have to acknowledge that racism is wrong and it's still here. I wonder what a world would look like without racism, they should write a book on it. I guess it'll be fiction for a while though.",7/13/1975 9:42
883,883," Hopefully one day we will see that, a society free of racism, hate only creates more hat and maybe fiction is the way to make that happen, its sure nice to imagine a world like that one",7/14/1971 8:12
883,97," It would be nice to imagine that world, it better be coming soon. Well I am going to call it a night, I hope you have a great one and take care!",9/6/2000 7:14
883,883, Lets hope that day comes soon and take care as well have a good night I think im calling it a night as well. ,1/18/2020 23:55
883,883, What do you think about the net worth of Kylie Jenner?,5/27/2010 22:17
883,97, I think that she is lucky. ,2/5/2015 20:18
883,883," Yeah, she definetely is, although I think that part of her health is actually self made, I think she does work hard.",8/8/2021 21:15
883,883," I would agree, she has worked for it, it wasn't totally handed to her on a silver platter.",7/9/1988 21:03
883,97," Yeah, its crazy how she was 21 when she became a millionare, I like the analogy with Lebron.",10/29/1983 11:54
883,883, yes its perfect. Did you see the police video with Uptown Funk?,4/13/2001 10:35
884,1573," The one of Bruno Mars? I haven actually seen that one, have you? did you like it.",6/28/1975 5:29
884,1573," I Havent either, but i love Bruno Mars, his songs are great, I am sure i would like it.  my nephew sings that song, hes 5 its so cute",11/21/1990 19:41
884,1573," Yeah he does have some pretty decent songs,Ive heard the Uptown Funk video has over 30 million views, thats crazy.",8/23/2010 5:18
884,1573, I didnt realize that.  I didnt realize that he started out as an elvis impersonator either! ,10/8/2009 11:44
884,1573," I saw that on Facebook, did you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for 75 million.",11/9/1983 11:31
884,884," no i didnt, haha I bet they are kicking them selves, because facebook basically made them irrelevent. ",10/17/2009 1:09
884,884," They sure are regrettin it lol, specially with the networth of Facebook now a days, I think Mark Zuckerburg is a great entrepeneur.",11/3/1995 20:16
884,884," yes for sure. Did you realize he is red green colorblind, so thats why things are mostly blue?",2/11/1995 13:35
884,884," I didnt know that, I thought it was a marketing thing, I did hear about the Burger king promotion, too bad I didnt spot that one.",11/25/2000 15:12
884,884," yea I never heard about that, but I am not a fan of BK any how ",11/6/2019 15:39
885,885," I like McDonalds more, but who could turn down a free burger lol.",4/14/2022 11:33
885,535, good point. What do you thing about  Patricia Heaton's support of Kavanaugh?  I think Its great to remember that these people are just people as well.,3/10/1991 0:25
885,885," I didnt really hear about that, could you tell me more about it?",8/2/2014 4:20
885,535, basically there was an article written  and she just pointed out that it was written to show the personal side of him. It was an article that said he was a great dad/ carpool guy.  ,2/9/1973 2:28
885,535," Oh I see thats interesting, it was nice chatting  to you, I will definetely use those anecdotes next time Im having dinner with family or friends, interesting topics.",3/2/2016 12:20
885,535, you as well,7/12/1972 13:49
885,885, have a nice day,5/21/1994 0:46
885,535, Forbes says Kylie Jenner is a billionaire. I had no idea.,2/1/1981 3:57
885,885, I did not know that either.  That is crazy.   Do you like space?  I would like to go to Mars someday,5/13/1995 2:08
885,885," I would love to go to space! Yeah, and they say Kylie Jenner is self made. But I don't think that is true. Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever.",11/22/1992 0:30
886,886, Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it,5/23/1986 12:22
886,1503," Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter! Does it have a name?",11/22/2019 9:12
886,886, I am not sure of its name.   I do know that the sunset on Mars is blue!  Is that not weird?,1/4/1985 0:07
886,886, That would be pretty neat to see! Sunsets on Earth never cease to amaze me.,6/20/1988 3:44
886,1503, Yes they are beautiful.  I love seeing the pictures sent back from Curiosity on Mars - its so sweet it sings happy birthday to itself,7/29/1981 2:45
886,1503, Those rovers are freaking adorable. I have ever thought so.,7/26/2010 2:42
886,1503, Yes.  I thought it was awesome that they used aluminum from the world trade centers on spirit and opportunity,9/13/2020 15:43
886,886, It's sad that a satellite was lost on Mars due to a technicality.,2/14/2020 13:19
886,886, Yes.    for sure.  I read about that on facebook.  Do you use that site?,12/16/1986 15:18
886,886, I try not to. Maybe I would more often if we used it for useful things like Iceland does.,8/2/1977 9:34
887,887, Yes they are rewriting their constitution on it!  How awesome is that,10/12/2013 9:11
887,887," Very cool, especially that the public can make suggestions and alterations.",2/21/2014 15:29
887,887, Yes.  It is pretty crazy that 30 percent of Americans use facebook as their primary source of news,4/28/2000 15:20
887,810, Yeah I don't use it for that. Did you ever use Myspace?,10/24/1989 2:24
887,887, I had an account but never used it.  They should have bought facebook when they had a chance,6/25/1992 11:31
887,887," Right, they could have bought it for only 79 million and now it's worth 104 billion",12/11/1982 14:51
887,887, I think its funny that the like button was originally going to be the awesome button,3/11/1981 6:52
887,810," Haha, that is interesting! And it's funny that the like button is illegal in the German state of Schleswig-holstein.",10/26/2013 8:55
887,887, Do you use Facebook?,3/15/1970 2:17
887,887," Yes, I do.",5/24/2000 7:24
888,420, You know when they went public they were worth 104 billion dollars,7/9/1970 15:32
888,420," Wow, that's incredible!  I guess Myspace had the option to buy Facebook at one point, I'm sure they've never stopped regretting that decision!!",12/20/2005 23:29
888,888, I know especially because they would have gotten it for a steal at 75 million. Apparently the like button is illegal in some German country. ,6/1/1974 10:16
888,420," That's curious, I wonder why Germany would ban the 'like' button.  That seems random!!  If you lived in Iceland you could contribute to rewriting their constitution - via Facebook!",5/16/1979 17:41
888,420, Yeah that sounds like a good idea or a really bad one. Burger king was trying to get ppl to unfriend facebook friends in exchange for a whooper.,8/5/2009 8:22
888,888, That's crummy of them...and whoever did it!  Apparently Mark Zuckerburg is a little colorblind - that's why Facebook is mostly blue!  I like blue so I'm not complaining...,10/22/2000 17:53
888,420, Yeah seems to work. They make most of there money from advertisement. ,8/26/2022 2:02
888,420, Did you know that sounds have a higher pitch on Mars then they do on Earth?  Is the Mars rover equipped with speakers??,12/22/2009 2:10
888,420," I guess so, lol! Speaking of Mars apparently Bruno writes his own music. ",11/23/2019 23:51
888,888," That doesn't surprise me!  I guess he wasn't good enough for Motown though, they dropped him years before he became a success!",6/22/2003 6:53
889,889," I did not know that or that he was named after a professional wrestler, Bruno Sammartino.",9/16/2019 18:37
889,889," That's funny!  I guess his parents were wrestling fans!!  But I heard his real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, so maybe Bruno is the wrestling fan?",5/30/1979 12:36
889,889, Yeah looks like he was trying to avoid a stereo type as a Latin pop singer. I don't think it worked.,8/24/2017 6:19
889,861," Maybe a little!  He does have a lot of mainstream success.  In 2023 they're planning on colonizing Mars, they're going to fund it by making it a reality TV show!",12/15/1988 3:43
889,861, I see! Did you know that Bruno started out as an Elvis impersonator? ,12/27/2019 8:40
889,889, That's really neat!  I didn't know that...he reminds me more of Michael Jackson.  But I guess Michael Jackson was obsessed with Elvis...it all checks out!,7/9/1983 16:55
889,889, Right! Apparently the bands name is The Hooligans. ,4/3/2016 8:23
889,861," The Elvis band?  I really like his song Uptown Funk, but I guess everyone does since it topped the charts in five different countries!",8/25/2020 13:42
889,889, Yeah! No Bruno's band is called the hooligans. You think since he writes his own music he could have come up with a better name but maybe it's just me.,8/18/2001 16:07
889,889," Lol, true!  It was fun talking with you!",11/14/1999 2:18
890,1498, hey did you know a robot can now be programmed to debone a chicken?,2/2/1987 5:16
890,890, Interesting. There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts.,4/10/2000 11:44
890,890," wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha",11/24/1987 6:19
890,1498, That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday.,11/3/1976 19:40
890,890, haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show,11/15/1999 8:28
890,1498," I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside. ",2/1/2019 4:37
890,890," haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings",7/3/2004 13:03
890,1498," Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots.",6/28/1981 8:58
890,1498," haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary!",11/29/2017 19:34
890,1498, Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one.,3/13/1976 10:16
891,17," no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site",3/31/1975 21:40
891,17," Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper.",1/7/1997 10:22
891,891, ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse? I guess a worker can walk up the 15 miles a day from their shift work,9/27/2018 17:52
891,17," I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans.",5/5/1987 11:59
891,891," haha thats what I think too, and I do wish I were the first person to order on amazon, only $28 and you could have had a building named after you!",12/24/2011 3:37
891,891, Nice! I think we will see Amazon come out with a factory floor robot sooner than one that has to adapt to a landscape that changes constantly because of dirty laundry and kids clothes.,2/22/1987 20:52
891,891," haha that would be awesome! humans are always evolving though, maybe robots are the next thing, I mean only 200,000 years ago we still had body hair",3/17/1999 11:56
891,17, And a lot of people do still have an awful lot of body hair. Haha. We supposedly get goosebumps because of an evolutionary trait that was used to make fur stand up and make an animal look bigger,9/4/2021 12:06
891,891," haha that is funny, it's weird that humans lost the ability to synthesize vitamin c, our gene is defective",12/17/2001 14:04
891,17, And we are the only mammals that cannot breathe and swallow at the same time. Bummer.,7/18/1994 15:09
892,23," haha imagine how cool that would be, that sucks and also sucks to be a human because there is a sound frequency that causes fear in us",4/13/2010 13:30
892,892, And our history only represents one minute and 17 seconds if earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period. it is sad we are destroying this earth.,8/20/2018 23:20
892,892," hi, do you like robots?",1/6/1997 14:53
892,23," hey! I do like robots, theyre so advanced I guess they can now debone a chicken which is awesome",11/21/1970 19:17
892,23, that is prettyy cool. And they can be controlled by using rat brains,5/27/2005 8:22
892,23," wow that is crazy, I think its cool the government used an xbox controller to control an eod robot",4/25/1977 1:15
892,892, Yeah that is. even Michael Jackson had an interest in them,5/27/2012 1:31
892,23," ya its wild he wanted to build a 50 foot tall robot! Like is that even possible? And it would moon walk, sounds awesome!",2/8/2011 21:17
892,892, it does sound very cool. do you ever shop on amazon?,8/17/2021 12:18
892,23," I have used amazon yes, what about you? Did you hear about the clock the owner of amazon built?",9/22/2010 19:17
893,893, Yeah I use it quite a bit. yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,5/15/1983 14:06
893,893," ya that is crazy, back to robos though did you see that mythbusters actually created a robot sidekick?",9/5/1997 7:12
893,893, No I did not know that. Do you know how amazon got started?,7/29/1985 3:48
893,193," no I don't, I just know that Bezos started it, do you know?",1/28/2011 11:56
893,893, It started as a book store and then slowly he built it up,8/17/2022 2:04
893,193," ah that is cool, I do know they have a special contract to deliver on sunday with USPS",8/14/1972 3:34
893,193," That is so cool, no wonder they can beat the competition. ANd they even own IMDB",9/19/1974 2:32
893,893," ya, I didn't know that, they bought them in 1998, I use that site everyday!",7/20/2018 8:04
893,193, Cool. do you know much about humans?,12/25/1995 14:50
893,193," well I do know there is a sound that will cause fear in all humans, its a certain frequency I think",2/14/1973 13:25
894,293, I would like to know what that sounds like. And we can grow ribs in 2-3 months,8/1/2013 19:26
894,293," ya that is crazy, do you think other animals cna do that? Could we harvest ribs from animals sustainably? haha",8/5/2010 19:38
894,293, Well that would be kind of nice in medicine for sure. Nice chatting with you.,4/4/1971 11:43
894,894," hi how are you? do you like mars? it is a planet, one of many.",1/20/1997 21:26
894,293, I think Mars is fascinating!,2/19/1991 5:31
894,894," mars really is a killer planet. it is red, red as all get out. plus it is associated with war. that is cool.",6/4/1996 5:25
894,293, It gets its name from the God of War.  ,12/20/2016 23:51
894,293, that is the coolest god of them all. i would like to get that job. mars is the fourth planet from the sun but it is tops in my book. it might seem small but it is huge to me. would you want to live there?,12/18/1997 1:43
894,293," Maybe, I hear there is a colonization project planned for 2023",4/26/1989 11:13
894,894," yes, i want to see who goes there and how much they get paid. it is a crazy job i think.",2/5/1970 20:30
895,895, Agreed.    Did you hear about the satellite lost on mars?,6/2/2007 19:57
895,1811, yes that was typical of us companies to use the wrong system of measurement. nobody uses imperial except maybe beer makers. maybe the guys were talking about beer? LOL,9/7/2011 4:45
895,1811, Quite possible.  Or distracted by the selfies they were posting to facebook.  Here's me and the rover!  :),10/19/1973 23:32
895,895," boy, those selfies on mars are really a distraction. i guess the IT guys on mars are never going to hear the end of the problems with the net, since the Cloud is back on earth.",10/27/1987 23:20
895,895, So very true.  I wonder if the like button would be  legal on mars.  There are parts of Germany where it isnt.,1/31/1973 1:05
895,895," if germany gets to mars first, they'll probably ban the like button for the entire planet!",10/8/1993 15:31
895,1811, Zuckerburg probably has problems with Mars- he has red-green colorblindness.  Thats why facebook is blue.,12/31/1970 7:25
895,1811, he will spend money to find a cure for r-g colorblindness. or he will upload his consciousness into a machine with better vision. he will prevail in the battle against death.,9/17/2013 13:46
895,1811, Both him and elon musk!,7/16/1972 3:08
895,895, elon will have a secret lab on mars to build his robot army to conquer  the earth. he and mark will have a battle royale in their robot bodies.,9/12/1990 13:50
896,896, That would be the fight of a lifetime..  Id give the edge to Musk,11/23/2019 10:55
896,896," good ol musky. he would be a great martian overlord. Anyway, great chat!",12/19/2003 6:12
896,896, You too!  Have a great day!,9/15/2005 17:53
896,896, Rock on! Have a great day! May the god of war favor you in the battles that come.,6/11/2022 12:28
896,896, Same to you!,5/29/2014 20:01
896,896, Are you a fan of Star Wars?,4/26/1996 21:20
896,896," Yea, I love the original 1977 Start Wars",6/9/2009 0:50
896,896, Me too!  All of the movies combined have made over $8.5 billion at the box office!,12/27/2006 5:03
896,1335," That is impressive, I guess that's why Star Wars was named the most successful film merchandising franchise by Guinness World Records",9/16/2020 10:04
896,1335, Oh yea...The entire franchise is estimated to be valued at $65 billion!,4/9/2013 17:31
897,897," That is impressive, I'm surprised that Star Wars is only the fifth highest-grossing media franchise",10/15/1974 3:39
897,1124," Yes!  I agree.  Marcia Lucas, the wife of George Lucas, won an academy award for editing the first movie.",3/29/2016 1:08
897,1124," Nice, Marcia Lucas had such a huge impact on Star Wars and made the film better",8/28/2012 2:45
897,897, I agree.  What's funny is that she won that award and George didn't win one for directing!,12/13/2013 21:44
897,1124, Yea but he did get to keep the licensing and merchandising rights from fox so he made out pretty good,12/21/1971 14:52
897,1124, Oh yes...smart move on his part!,3/28/2021 5:29
897,1124," Yea, 20th century fox really messed up and should of just paid George the 500k directing fee",11/28/2001 0:15
897,1124, Yes lol.  Do you use Netflix?,8/27/2010 7:24
897,897," Yea, I signed up for Netflix a few years after Reed Hastings founded it in 1997",12/8/1983 19:16
897,1124, Nice!  From 9 PM to 12 AM Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.  That's when I watch it!,5/11/1988 2:07
898,1468, Pretty crazy despite all the people who stream it Netflix pays much more on postage than bandwidth,10/16/2004 9:46
898,898, I agree!  Netflx and youtube together make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.  So basically half of America is online just to watch videos.  lol,2/10/1975 22:18
898,898, Blockbuster must be really kicking itself for not buying netflix for 50 million,11/17/1971 9:26
898,1468, No doubt since Netflix is now worth $2 billion and Blockbuster is down to 1 store.  lol  It's been fun chatting!,7/7/2015 9:13
898,1468," Yep, and Blockbuster's $40 late fee on Apollo 13 inspired Hastings to start netflix",9/30/1999 5:36
898,1468, Awesome!  It's been fun.  Have a great day!,5/23/2013 11:53
898,898, Do you like star wars,1/16/2012 19:41
898,898, Oh yes!  And was happy to see luke skywalker nack!,4/7/1984 23:33
898,1468, I still wish he had a bigger part. Some people are saying the last jedi underpeformed,2/3/2005 2:54
898,1468, I don't agree with... I liked it a lot!,10/14/1984 15:06
899,899, We'll just have to hope episode 9 shuts everyone up,9/17/2005 5:53
899,899, I am sure of it!  That's funny George lucas's wife won an acedemy award,5/28/1984 19:42
899,899, I know and george lucas didnt! But she did have an influence on vital scenes. Including obi wan's death,1/1/1984 21:34
899,899," Yeah i know, but still :)  That's cool, that they dubbed it in navajo language",8/24/2007 14:33
899,1829, I wonder if they still had james earl jones. You cant change vader's voice!,7/26/1995 4:37
899,1829, Not really sure! and i soooo agree!,3/5/2009 18:10
899,1829, I think 8.5 billion total revenue makes all the movies pretty successful,4/21/1978 15:22
899,899, WOW... that's a lot of money!  Love how fox lost billions because they didn't believe in the franchise!,2/22/1989 2:44
899,1829, It make Lucas a billionaire! The value of the franchise is 65 billion,10/8/2019 21:14
899,899, Whoaaaaa!  chaching!  You see some of the star wars are on Netflix?,7/27/1977 13:07
900,1253," Yeah, I need to check out Solo. I havent watched that yet. Heard that also was received poorly",11/17/1993 3:52
900,1253, I am sure it is great!  These people are just haters... especially since Disney bought the franchise!,5/22/2022 20:33
900,900, We can all agree that Luke Skywalker is the man though! Although he was almost a girl,9/24/2009 19:57
900,900," Really?  WOW!  Well, glad they went with a guy.  Although Ren is pretty bad ass!",5/15/2007 13:02
900,900, Yeah I cant wait to finish up her story. They kept Vader and Luke's story a secret even from the cast. Giving out fake scrpits. I wonder if they have any of the same tricks up their sleeves,3/30/2006 13:40
900,900, I think it's a great idea and really hope they do!,8/11/1979 11:17
900,900, There are also a lot of other comic stories I would love to see on the big screen. Hopefully one day. Have a great day!,10/19/2010 15:03
900,900," Hi, how are you doing today?",12/24/2020 19:11
900,900, Well thanks. Are you a star wars fan?,8/29/2015 22:39
900,1253," Oh, yes!  I'm a big fan of Star Wars.",10/10/2019 9:24
901,1513, The star wars movies have made a combined 8.5 billion dollars. Thats incredible,8/28/1983 16:01
901,1513," Yes, it is.  It holds a Guinness World Records title for the Most successful film merchandising franchise.",9/20/1978 22:19
901,901, Thats crazy. I wonder if Fox regrets giving Lucas the merchandising rights,11/20/2014 7:36
901,901," Ooh, I bet they do big time.  Huge mistake on their part.  I can't believe they thought it would be a flop.",4/27/2004 21:08
901,901, $500k cost them billions and made George a billionaire himself,4/10/1992 19:51
901,1513, I'm happy for him.  What I find interesting is that James Earl Jones only took 2.5 hours to record all of his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00.,8/10/2012 20:26
901,901, That is crazy to think about! And the movie wouldn't be the same without his voice.,9/5/1975 3:27
901,901," You're so right.  Nobody else could have said,  Luke, I am your father, quite like him.  lol",9/23/2014 9:26
901,1513," Speaking of Luke, did you know he was originally written as a girl?",11/12/1993 7:04
901,1513," Yeah, I had heard that about Luke.  Did you know that the original light saber prop used by Luke Skywalker is inside the International Space Station?",9/7/2007 4:31
902,902, I wonder if the astronauts are allowed to play with it,7/12/1980 3:27
902,902, I very much doubt that. Lol I read somewher that you can rent an overnight stay in Luke's boyhood home in Tunisia for $10.00.  I wonder how many die hard fans have did that?,10/15/1973 0:01
902,902, For only 10 dollars Im sure a lot. Luke is a pivotal figure in the Rebel Alliance,2/23/1971 19:49
902,902," Star Wars fans are a fanatical bunch.  I should know, I'm one.  ",1/21/1975 14:11
902,902, Do you think in todays age the script of vader being lukes father would of been able to be kept a secret like it was? ,4/26/1986 21:44
902,902," No, times have changed and integrity and honesty went out the window a long time ago.  You would have to force everyone to sign a ginormous gag order under penalty of imprisonment to keep a secret now.  And even then that wouldn't stop some people from gabbing.",4/7/2000 7:11
902,1122, Have you watched any of the star wars movies on netflix?,2/6/1983 11:13
902,902," No, not on Netflix, I have boxed sets of all the movies.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you about Star Wars, but I need to go walk my dog.  Talk to you later, friend.",4/20/2009 20:26
902,902, This government shutdown is not looking great.,6/7/1987 7:41
902,902, Not at all.  I saw McCarthy next to Trump often.  Do they like each other?,12/9/2012 22:36
903,903," Paul McCarthy, the singer? Kind of interesting. Paul is a very common name, ever heard of Paul Ryan?",11/1/2013 10:27
903,903, Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house.  He left.,4/16/2012 12:16
903,903, Yah. I wonder if he's going to try and run for 2020 election for the GOP.,8/1/1983 14:19
903,1209, I don't know.  By the way McCarthy is House Minority Leader (a republican),5/22/1980 5:37
903,1209, Ahh. that makes a bit more sense.. lol.,12/4/1977 15:34
903,1209, I guess so.  Ryan tried to shore up his power prior to leaving the house.,7/26/1977 4:39
903,1209," Definitely, I could see that. Although incumbent typically is chosen to represent the prior winning party, I don't know if the GOP is willing to deal with Trump anymore.",10/31/1977 10:48
903,903, It is weird.  Why were Ryan concerned about its donors not contributing $$?  He was going to leave anyway.,9/13/2017 21:39
903,903, It's all about having the funds/access to funds. ,3/12/1988 9:33
903,1209, for the republican party in general?  ,1/10/1974 9:40
904,1700, Yes. The republican party needs donors so they can properly campaign. I guarantee that the Democrats will get a bit of pool money this year to campaign. We saw this in the 2018 midterm elections.,3/6/1999 2:14
904,904, Ryan endorsed McCarthy to replace him.,1/24/1981 2:13
904,1700, I thought the current speaker is Nancy Pelosi since they took majority during the 2018 elections,1/23/1971 18:45
904,1700," It was in case the republican party won the majority.  Thus, it was decided prior to the midterm.",6/20/1988 13:41
904,1700," Oh i see. Politics, I try to keep up with them but it's just too time consuming. ",12/1/2008 9:00
904,904," If you take it too seriously, it could be very stressful.  Jim Jordan wanted to replace Ryan.",3/31/1984 11:42
904,1700, Why can't we do what the ancient athens did. Appoint by lottery. ,2/10/1994 2:12
904,904, Why do you think the ancient system (athens) would work?  A republican senator said that last year was a turbulent year in politics.,10/16/2002 4:21
904,1700," Oligarchy is what we are seeing now... Where Ryan wanted McCarthy. Jordan wanted to replace Ryan. If it was random, you could be a president too!",6/27/2005 5:11
904,1700, I just want to be able to work and support my family.  I dislike all the fighting related to power and politics.,5/14/2020 4:02
905,934," If you become president you can end it all. 300K, with a mandate on no more fighting!",12/24/2003 19:15
905,934, Did you know the taller candidate has won the US Election 75% of the time? ,9/9/1977 10:18
905,905," I had heard that.  It is an interesting metric to think about when it comes to elections.  I wonder if that accounts for popular vote, or just the election.",1/25/2020 21:24
905,905," I'm not sure, good question. There are 3 subways lines exclusively for congressmen though!",4/20/1981 19:30
905,905, That is kind of crazy.  Did you know Elmo testified before congress?,3/1/2004 14:31
905,905," No, was it a joke or for real? ",9/25/1973 23:26
905,905," Im not totally sure, but I know he is the only non-human to do so.  Maybe Oscar the grouch was causing some problems down in the hood or something.  lol",8/25/2005 20:51
905,934," LOL, I wonder what actor played him? ",5/4/1991 9:21
905,934," I dont know, I always just imagine a stuffed toy or something.  The Congress always plays a Rep vs Dem game of baseball each year.",5/31/2006 4:04
905,934," Yeah, that is fairly common. It must be a very boring game to watch though. ",10/13/1985 21:46
906,906," I agree.  I imagine they can't be any good, which could make it funny, but in a very sad sense.",5/13/2017 17:54
906,230, Yeah. Maybe they can put Elmo in! LOL,7/24/2021 19:06
906,906," With the current political colors, he'd have to be on the republican side.  Although they have only been using those since 2000",2/21/2006 14:44
906,230," Wow, I didn't know that. There is also a fantasy congress, I suppose that is one boring game. ",11/17/1993 7:10
906,230, A fantasy congress?  Is that like fantasy football?  How would you even get points?,8/9/1976 13:12
906,230," I'm not sure, but it sure doesn't sound fun. I suppose some people would be into it. ",5/29/1990 0:29
906,230," Definitely not people in Nevada, they actually have a none of these candidates options on the ballot.  I would have loved that one in the past.",1/28/1972 13:46
906,906, Yeah. Well voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in 100 years. ,7/2/1984 6:28
906,230," I wonder why that is?  I mean when people are dissatisfied you would think they would be more inclined to vote, unless they feel like their vote doesnt matter due to the Electoral College",8/17/2005 15:48
906,906, I'm not sure. Probably because a lot of people realize their vote won't sway a particular state. ,4/25/1979 23:07
907,907," True.  I live in the state that is notorious for messing up elections and counting, Florida.",7/26/2021 5:36
907,907," Yeah, they are always in the news about that. Well nice chatting with you! ",1/14/2022 21:15
907,907," Hello,  did you every us president with a beard has been republican?",9/26/1974 7:01
907,907," Hi. I just read that, and find that to be pretty funny! That's one of those facts that is fun but meaningless. ",3/22/2022 21:04
907,1237, lol yup useless information.  Just like there hasnt been a us president who wasnt rep or dem since 53.,6/20/2002 4:17
907,907," So I guess that last time there was a third party candidate that was successful was over 150 years ago. I wonder what the name of the party was? That was just before the civil war, unless I have forgotten my dates.",9/2/2006 22:53
907,1237," Good question,  I am not sure.  ",5/27/2022 4:21
907,1237, I wonder if there fact about a republican being elected that wasn't a Nixon or Bush (since 1928) was written before Trump's election? He ran as a Republican and won.,3/11/1973 14:01
907,1237, Not sure. did you know the taller candidate won the presidental election 75% of the time.?,10/21/1988 17:34
907,907," Yes, I've seen that before, that taller men win more than shorter men. It's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed in Dumbo the Elephant, since an elephant is the symbol of the Republican party. Another fun party fact!",7/6/1972 15:51
908,908, Yeah thats extreme kinda. lol its Dumbo hes a disney character.  Did you see previews for the new Dumbo live action movie about to come out?,5/6/1992 23:57
908,609," No! I didn't hear about that. So they will use live elephants? I recently watched the last Disney movie, The Nutcracker and the 4 realms. ",11/14/2012 10:43
908,908," Haha I think the elephants are cgi.  But the actors are real.  I seen that movie,  it was kinda boring in my opinion.",2/27/1995 8:01
908,609, I know! We were disappointed because we the cg on the previews was great. But the plot and acting were fairly bad!,3/10/1983 5:36
908,908," I know right,  the cgi was awesome,  so colorful and nice.  My daughter wanted to see it and of course she loved it,  we were falling asleep on it lol ",5/20/2011 13:31
908,609, Maybe that is it! The little kids like it but it didn't come through for adults. Disney  is usually good at reaching both audiences.,3/30/1975 6:23
908,908," Yes usually,  it appeals to adults too. I really liked that movie Inside Out,  that had a lot of adult jokes in it and very entertaining to children. ",8/19/2015 16:26
908,609," Speaking of your daughter, is she into Elmo and the other Seasame Street characters? I thought it was funny that Elmo testified before Congress!",12/27/2007 13:38
908,908," haha,  she used to be.  Not anymore,  shes into all things princess right now.  That is awesome fact though. ",3/23/1985 19:37
908,609," I really wonder what he testified about, unless it was to lobby to continue funding PBS or the arts or something in that area?",4/29/2022 9:09
909,596," haha.  I learned that the firsst woman was elected in congres before she even had the right to vote,  weird huh",5/17/2010 16:08
909,909," Yes, that is very weird and it just really strange to think about how much things have changed in politics and society in general!",6/8/2022 18:42
909,909," well its been great talking with you,  have a good one. ",1/31/1986 2:59
909,596, Good morning. Do you follow politics?,5/5/1983 12:04
909,596," Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply.",7/27/2012 13:46
909,909, Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time.,11/8/1998 8:09
909,909," Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling.",9/10/2018 20:48
909,596, Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting? ,3/24/1975 10:26
909,596," I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks.",7/14/2008 16:06
909,596, On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol.,6/1/1998 21:34
910,1395," Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking.",12/19/1974 10:43
910,910, H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh?,5/24/2008 6:57
910,910," That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken.",9/16/1979 3:01
910,910, I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states.,2/9/2009 22:59
910,910," That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections.",4/27/1987 11:45
910,1395, I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress?,4/27/1982 2:57
910,1395, Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move.,7/5/2005 15:48
910,1395, No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there. Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916.,5/11/1984 10:15
910,1395," Woman are becoming more represented, may one day the Presidential job can be their, whether she is red or blue.",10/19/1982 19:18
910,1395, I just dont understand why women couldnt vote but could be elected to congress.,9/1/2013 17:23
911,179," Maybe it was an oversight of the rule writers, a loop hole so to speak.  Surprising that so many men would have voted for woman back in 1916.",2/27/2011 15:32
911,179, I am surprised as well. Did you know that elmo once testified before congress?,9/14/1980 11:02
911,179," Elmo, I'd like to have seen how they did that.   What would he have been talking about.  I know Steven Colbert did so too, in character.",10/1/1997 21:57
911,179, Im not a big stephen colbert fan to be honest with you. Do you know that voter turnout or president hasnt crossed 62.8 percent in over 100 years,8/21/1976 18:56
911,911, In all likelihood it will continue to drop and more people get frustrated with Congress.,1/13/2001 2:12
911,179, You are probably right on that. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a republican.,7/6/1976 4:27
911,911," Must be in the GOP's rule book somewhere, they have been letting us down on that front over the past few years.  Good talking with you.",12/13/2021 4:18
911,911, Well its been a good chat but I got to get to work.,3/19/1991 10:34
911,911," Have a good day, bye.",10/20/2005 10:25
911,179, Good Morning! How are you today?,11/29/1974 2:18
912,1723," Hi, I am good. Do you follow politics?",8/13/2005 1:10
912,912, I like to follow it! Especially when Elmo was the only non human to testify in congress.,3/12/1993 13:09
912,912, That's hilarious. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853?,2/16/1979 0:58
912,912," I wonder who it was! If he had a beard, he would have been republican.",10/24/1980 11:54
912,912, Not too sure on that. The last time a rep was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,11/18/1974 21:29
912,1723, That just blows my mind! I didn't realize that the red and blue colors with the parties wasn't really a thing until 2000!,8/27/1989 18:45
912,912, I agree. I didn't know that was a thing for such a shot time either. ,11/28/1991 20:05
912,1723, I think it's funny what Nevada has printed on their voting options!,1/11/2018 18:01
912,912, I think so too. Do you know much about Congress?,11/16/2017 17:29
912,912, I try to understand it! I know it kind of started in the 1770s!,6/12/2009 10:32
913,913, I do too. There are 3 subways line that only congressmen can ride.,8/20/1991 17:49
913,104, Yet I'm sure they all take taxis! Did you ever hear about Truman at Disneyland?,10/30/1976 19:06
913,104, I did not. What happened?,8/6/1976 7:23
913,104, He refused to get his picture taken on the Dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with Republicans lol.,5/23/1970 13:59
913,104, HAHA! Did you know there is fantasy Congress game?,12/13/2021 1:00
913,104," I didn't know that, what is it about?",2/16/1992 9:06
913,104," Basically, you draft members of Congress and points are based off legislative success.",6/26/1976 9:52
913,104, I wonder who would be the number one and two pick? ,5/9/1981 4:45
913,913, Not too sure on that. I don't follow Congress closely enough to know that.,12/1/2003 17:12
913,913," Me neither, I might go look into that though. It was a pleasure chatting, have a great day!",7/3/1993 15:59
914,1712," Hi, how are you today? These are 3 interesting articles, don't you think?",8/19/1988 22:31
914,914, I can't believe is has been over 150 since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican,2/18/1982 18:37
914,914, I suppose if you want to look at the original strict definitions of what Democrats or Republican party platforms were. ,11/21/1973 21:38
914,1712, DId you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republlican?,1/12/1988 22:03
914,914, I thought that little fact was amusing but I guess manlyness sell to voters. It just shows that politicians are sensitive to what they perceive are optics.,9/22/1983 7:36
914,914, Do you know when the last a Republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was?,12/4/2015 12:18
914,1712," I think the last itme was the pair HErbet Hoover & CHarles CUrtis, 1928",1/10/2010 17:04
914,1712, I believe you are correct.  How interested are you by politics?,4/14/2016 11:18
914,1712," I am very interested as the choices I make as a voter will directly decide how I represented, good or bad. ",6/11/2007 22:42
914,914, Are you sadden by the fact that voter participation hasn't been over 63% in presidential election in the last 100 years?,3/17/1992 17:56
915,915, I am as there places in the world where people do not have open and free elections. I vote in every election either in person or by mail in ballot. It's my duty as a citizen and my right. ,8/14/1993 2:33
915,915, I agree.  I would rather choose my path than have someone chose it for me,8/12/1977 17:53
915,1720," Though you can still see how voters can be swayed by things that have little to do with a candidates beliefs, like the beards, or who was a taller candidate.",9/25/1999 2:36
915,915," Yes, for example, How FDR's people never allowed him to be photographed in a wheelchair.",10/23/1989 9:18
915,915," YEs, or Truman refusing to be photographed on the Dumbo ride. I guess optics really do matter, but sometimes, things like Roosevelt's health sham can be harmful to the country.",4/1/2006 17:59
915,1720," On a lighter note, are you aware of the annual Democrat vs Republican softball game?",2/3/2016 2:43
915,1720," I am, and I think that is a fun way to blow off steam, with some clean fun bragging rights. In these days of such acrimony, events like that are really needed to show these folks are human.",8/13/2005 13:40
915,1720," Yes, the more time they can spend together in a fun setting perhaps they will see themselves more like friends instead of enemies.",3/27/1980 9:34
915,915," I agree and a baseball games gets them out of the office, into the fresh air and on to a level playing field, so to speak.",7/19/2011 15:40
915,915," A level playing field, I like that.  Did you the first woman was elected to congress in 1916 before she can even vote in a national election?",10/12/1980 6:03
916,916, I did not know that but it shows she must have had a strong message to be accepted into the male world of politics even though she could not vote for them herself.,9/27/1976 2:57
916,916," I am not sure if this true for the first woman, but i think quite a few of the early woman were elected after their husbands died",11/5/1976 4:33
916,916," I have heard of that happening, not everytime, but they still have to be strong enough and savy enough to navigate the system.",10/21/1978 2:08
916,916," True, it must have been tough to succeed in a system where many did not take you seriously",1/4/1971 19:59
916,916," It just shows how todays women in congress and in the senate have had to be tough as nails, yet have a message that can resonate with the people they want to represent and I applaud them. They will bring a new outlook to the old boys club.",11/20/2007 22:42
916,1627," Good talking to you, bye",4/4/1972 14:33
916,916, Hi! Do you follow politics?,3/2/2018 12:18
916,916," hey there yes I do, did you know the republican party was founded in 1854",12/25/2000 14:39
916,1627, I didnt realize that.  I didnt realize that they dominated in the northern states either.,12/28/1976 9:50
916,916," ya I didn't either, also didn't know that red and blue weren't associated with republicans and democrats until the year 200",4/1/1993 17:02
917,1790, Same here!  I thought those had been around forever!,7/27/1972 15:48
917,917," I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY!",9/8/2008 11:41
917,917, That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power.,5/27/1990 23:05
917,917," yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials",2/21/2016 13:37
917,1790, I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy.,6/10/1974 16:21
917,917," yup you're right, its sad though, the highest voter turnout we've ever had in the USA was 62.8%",2/13/2009 8:22
917,917, Maybe if there were options like Nevada has people would vote!,9/4/1994 23:22
917,1790, yup but if they are choosing to vote none of these candidates then your vote is still meaningless haha so whats the point of showing up,7/20/2015 17:06
917,917," Well, if there was something in place that would require a new ticket if that got so many votes that would be great.",6/22/1972 16:30
917,1790," ya thats a good diea, do you know why the taller candidate usually wins in US elections? That seems weird that they win 75% of the time",12/24/1998 5:04
918,967," Yeah, maybe people associate height with power?",9/27/1973 21:53
918,918," it must be something primal like that, did you know that there is an exclusive subway line that shuttles congresspeople to different government buildings?",6/29/1984 14:02
918,918," I heard about those, and the Rep. vs. dems baseball game the congress plays.  That must be hilarious.",5/4/1984 13:05
918,918," yes they've been playing those games since 1909, the republicans are up by 3 wins overall btw!",8/28/2014 9:06
918,918, I wonder how many people actually play fantasy congress.  I cant imagine that would be too exciting.,4/9/2014 10:16
918,967," haha ya that sounds boring, also boring to be there while Elmo was testifying before Congress lol talk about a waste of time",5/19/2014 7:51
918,918, I wonder what elmo had to say...  lol  Have a great day!  Nice Chat!,12/1/2016 20:53
918,967," Hello, do you follow politics?",4/23/2003 3:48
918,967," Hi, it's hard not to these days with everything going on in the news.",10/14/2012 20:11
918,918, I agree. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853?,3/31/1994 0:53
919,1584," Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway.",3/14/2011 1:03
919,919, Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.,6/17/1989 16:51
919,919, Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party...,10/18/1990 1:20
919,1584, Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.,4/22/1989 22:54
919,919," Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans?",10/16/1973 8:49
919,1584, That's hilarious. I did not know that about her. ,7/11/1978 9:23
919,919," Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy. ",8/4/1993 2:28
919,1584, Oh wow I didn't know that either. I saw the red and blue colors associated with each party didn't start until 2000.,5/15/1991 17:57
919,1584, That is crazy. So recently yet it feels like they've always been that way. I think they should change the voting system so the popular vote counts for more.,2/20/2003 2:35
919,1584, Yea I'm not too sure what would work these days for the election. ,12/7/1998 0:01
920,1377," Elections are a mess, not just presidential. A dog has not only won an election for mayor but served as a mayor for 13 years! Dogs don't even live much past 13 lol.",1/3/1989 9:26
920,1377," I agree. LOL - that's pretty funny! During the 2012 US elections, international observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.",3/30/2004 3:20
920,1377, I can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like. Hopefully by then they start allowing you to vote online. I can't imagine it would be that hard. In Oregon elections are done by mail. Online would be a natural progression.,11/1/2017 1:40
920,1377," I agree. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the election by 75%.",9/20/2006 22:51
920,920, I guess if you're short it's barely worth running. Subconscious perceptions most likely or it's just a fluke.,7/1/2000 18:41
920,920, LOL yep. I heard that is actually the case for interviews too.,6/21/2020 14:32
920,1377, There are certainly some weird facts. The faster blinker has in debates has lost every presidential election since 1980. I can't see how blinking speed would effect public opinion?,8/24/1998 13:14
920,920, It was good chatting with you!,3/17/1997 12:37
920,920, Have you read Book Club or Fifty Shades of Grey?,9/20/2020 7:31
920,920," No I haven't.  I've seen commercials for both movies and Book Club looks interesting.  I like Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen.  Have you read the books?",11/19/2004 11:12
921,1181," I havent, I did see the movies, the Book Club movie was pretty good and Im guessing the book is better, the movie grossed around 12 million",1/23/1984 8:56
921,1181, I think Book Club mentions other books such as Moby Dick and Fifty Shades of Grey.,6/15/2015 5:13
921,921," Well its a romantic comedy novel,  and yeah books like Fifty Shades are referenced in it also Don Quixote, so seems interesting",2/10/2022 7:19
921,1181, I think mentioning other literature like A midsummer Night's Dream in the movie can inspire readers and movie watchers to read more.,12/18/1975 21:48
921,1181," I agree that would be a good way to inspire readers specially fans of the novel, do you like to read?",1/21/1984 20:30
921,921, I used to. I just don't seem to have the time any more.  You know what I think is interesting is that the olympics used to have literature as an olympic event up until 1952.  It's a shame they don't anymore.,5/3/1975 21:37
921,1181, It was?  I heard architecture and paiting were events as well but didnt know literature was another one,1/28/2003 0:01
921,921," Yes it was along with music, painting, and even sculpture.  It really seems like back in the day art was valued much more than now.",11/16/2003 4:13
921,921," It sure was, I think it should remain an olimpyc event, it may not be a sport but it would be interesting to watch, a prize for the best artist",8/20/1978 0:43
921,921, i agree with you completely.  Did you know that Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature?  You would think it would be for peace or some other government related event but instead it was for writing.,9/11/2021 14:48
922,1855," I didnt and I agree it does seen odd he must have some pretty good novels or pieces, you know romantic kissing is like a new development!",4/13/2013 7:00
922,1855, Is it really?  It seems like something people have been doing since the beginning of time.  Do you know when it started?,9/21/1993 17:22
922,1855," Not sure, but its a recent development according to the article, you know what makes me angry? censoring books like the FDA, they burn down 6 tons of books",12/1/1985 1:28
922,922, That is bad. They must have done that years ago. I don't remember anything recent about burning books.  In today's world even if they did the book would be online so we no longer have to worry about censorship.,4/14/2021 13:07
922,1855," Yeah I agree, its a good thin we have online book stores now but still why burn books doesnt seem like the right thing to do, do you know who Tom Hanks is?",7/9/1998 9:44
922,922, I do know who he is.  Is he a favorite actor of yours?  As far as comedy goes I like bill Murray.  You know he said that kung fu hustle is a supreme achievement in modern comedy.  Weird but funny.,7/31/1974 3:46
922,1855," Yeah he is one of my favorites for sure, he is actually the highest all time box office star and was  over 8.5 billion in earnings, thats pretty impressive I must say",12/21/2019 4:24
922,922," It definitely is. It's much more impressive than the movie Trojan Wars. It had a budget of 415,000,000 and earned only $309 at the box office.",1/27/1973 4:14
922,1855," Wow that is sure disappointing, they only earned $309? that must be a total failure for sure",5/15/1981 4:47
922,1855," It must have been. I messed up by the way.  The budget was $15,000,000.  Sorry for the confusion.  ",10/8/1999 9:14
923,923," How are you? Did u know With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.",3/5/1985 20:38
923,650," I think I read that somewhere.  I did know however that Even though John Carter was considered a flop for Disney, it did great in Russia, even breaking box office records",11/1/1990 9:30
923,923, Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.,10/29/1988 21:50
923,650," Good think it didn't.  If you take inflation into account, the original Star Wars trilogy made more money that the prequels in the US by $1,328,009,800.",9/23/2000 3:09
923,923, wow thats crazy! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.,5/19/1980 4:32
923,923, I didn't know it did that good.  The first game to surpass Hollywood box office sales was Mortal Kombat 2.  I actually saw that one.  I was a huge fan of the game.,1/18/1976 20:57
923,650," The game was awesome!  Still a classic,  the movie was not that great lol ",3/22/1993 9:45
923,923," The first one was I thought, but not the second one.  I was surprised to see that the Lord of the Rings trilogy made big losses even though it was a huge box office success.",6/12/1973 20:22
923,650, Wow thats crazy!!  That was an amazing series!,1/30/1998 0:10
923,650," I know, I am shocked it lost money.  I am also a humongous comedy fan.  Did you know that Drew Carey was in the Marine Corps for 8 years.  He would tell jokes to his fellow marines.",12/9/2007 10:36
924,924," Yeah read that too,  i cant imagine him in the marines!  I love his show  Whose line is it anyway?",9/17/2020 18:33
924,924," Yes, that is a classic.  I was shocked to see Evan Almighty was the most expensive comedy ever made.  It had a budge of $200 million. ",10/10/1989 14:38
924,1966," Oh right,  I remember reading that.  Thats pretty crazy too,  but it probably all went to cgi,  ",1/25/2018 10:29
924,1966," I bet, but definitely not worth it.  A comedy has not won the Academy Award for best picture in 37 years.",11/15/1999 6:49
924,924, Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989,6/7/1984 14:31
924,924," Man, the Dave Chappelle show on there was the funniest show EVER in my opinion.  Check this out.  In 1981, The Empire Strikes Back was nominated by the writers guild of America for its best comedy award.  Strange. ",3/26/2014 8:54
924,924, lol it definitely had some comedy aspects! Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy.,8/19/1985 15:15
924,1966," I read that somewhere.  I was surprised to hear that.  I know in early comedy, slipping on a banana peel was meant to mean slipping in horse manure.  ",5/21/1970 8:53
924,1966, Really?  Thats hilarious!,8/6/2015 19:26
924,1966, Yes it is.  I am a fan of Satire comedy as well. That is when comedy is used to portray people or social issues as ridiculous or corrupt. ,4/15/2005 12:11
925,925," good talking to u,  have a good one!",6/14/2016 3:15
925,925, Hi. Do you like comedy?  I didn't know until recently that comedy originated in ancient greece.,8/8/1976 7:11
925,925," ya I do like comedy, I like that Drew Carey got his start doing comedy when he was in the marines",6/12/2021 13:22
925,925, I didn't know that. I had no idea he was in the marines!  The greek that comedy was two groups against one another in an amusing conflict.,4/20/1978 18:13
925,666," yup, comedy is cool it was founded in ancient Greece which I didnt know",9/25/2012 7:53
925,666," It's got to be hard to do too.  I mean, comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989.",7/16/1989 3:40
925,925," that is crazy, its funny too the first comedy film was a guy slipping on a banana peel to fall into horse poop haha",12/16/2016 18:17
925,666," It is funny.  I'm guessing it was an old film and even still today that would be funny!  Hey,did you know that ancient greece did political satire and it influenced their voters?  Sounds a lot like today's world.",2/12/1971 4:32
925,666," that does sound like today, I like parody best though, it subverts your expectations and critiques without condemning",5/7/2001 14:26
925,666, I like that too.  It seems nicer.  Everyone has their favorite though.  Bill Murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of modern age comedy.,9/27/2005 18:03
926,926," haha I do like that movie, have you seen Evan Almighty?",3/15/1975 1:34
926,926, I think I have. Is that the one with Jim Carrey?  ,3/18/2000 16:41
926,36," that was Bruce Almighty, this one was actually the most expensive comedy ever made",3/26/1986 11:20
926,36," Are you serious?  There are so many others out there I would think would be just as expensive if not more.  I wonder if it did any good.  Trojan Wars had a budget of $15,000,000 and only earned $309.",12/26/2017 19:24
926,926," haha weird, also weird its been 40 years since a comedy won best picture",4/11/1981 9:14
926,926," That is weird.  Everyone likes comedy but I guess since everyone's tastes are different it's hard to single one thing out for an award.  Then again, tv shows are different.  3rd Rock from the Sun won best comedy series in 1997. It beat out the greats- Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",2/3/1995 4:22
926,36, I like all those shows! did you know empire strikes back somehow was nominated for a comedy award back in 1981,8/11/1973 21:40
926,926, No I didn't know that! I don't see how that could be considered a comedy at all.  That reminds me of the movie the green lantern. It was going to be a comedy originally.,7/16/1975 12:20
926,36," haha that movie was horrible, did you ever see MOrtal Kombat 2?",12/19/2015 23:34
926,926, No I didn't see that.  I know a little about it though. Isn't it from a video game?  I don't know who is in it but I know it's not Tom Hanks. He's the highest all time box office star.,12/12/2009 18:10
927,927," ya Mortal Kombat 2 was the first game to make more than the hollywood movie based on it, so the game was good but the movie was unpopular",2/10/1970 1:48
927,1551, That's funny and awful at the same time!  It's like Disney's Treasure Planet.  It's one of the most expensive failures ever.,12/16/2011 9:40
927,1551, Hey how often do use the internet? I know that I'm using it right now haha,4/13/1971 7:26
927,1551, I use it really often and Im using it right now as well lol so a lot ,9/24/1996 2:32
927,927," Well I personally like clicking on hamburger buttons, they're the buttons that are made of three horizontal lines,+ the name makes me hungry",6/1/1975 18:42
927,927," That makes me hungry as well, crazy how only 7% of the people read the terms on a service or product on the net",6/6/2007 2:37
927,1551, Yeah I know that I never read them haha. If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there,6/12/1984 9:04
927,1551," That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet",6/5/1991 13:11
927,927," I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links",10/11/2001 6:40
927,1551," That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now",5/17/2013 0:48
928,1008, No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy?,8/1/1975 0:54
928,928," I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies",6/9/1977 23:03
928,1008, Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere,12/23/1983 0:47
928,928," No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion",6/8/2018 22:09
928,928," Well that's pretty cool. Did you ever hear of the show X-Files? Apparently in that show aliens began to colonize Earth back in 2012, so maybe they already are here haha",7/26/2006 21:49
928,1008," I used to love that show, and who knows maybe they are I try to keep an open mind about that",2/22/2012 13:03
928,928, Yes it's best to keep an open mind. What do you think about Tom Cruise? Did you know he built a 10 million dollar bunker in his basement to protect him from Aliens LOL,10/19/1992 19:14
928,1008," I think he is a great actor, he definitely has the money to do that, I think his a bit too paranoid though",4/24/2017 10:19
928,1008," Yep it seems like a really weird thing to buy, have you seen the movie Aliens though? Apparently those aliens were based off of deep sea creatures",10/10/1972 21:15
928,928," Wow, those creatures must be really scary Im guessing you also like astronomy right?",7/18/2008 2:02
929,929," Yes I definitely like astronomy, what about you? Did you know that after they created Wi-Fi, they were able to use that technology to improve astronomy and imaging in outer space",7/5/2021 13:43
929,609," That is amazing, I dint know that but I can see how the net has improved many things, astronomy one of them",6/22/2014 1:49
929,609," I agree, do you like Bill Nye the Science Guy? Apparently he is the executive director of the planetary society which is an astronomy organization",4/29/1992 19:05
929,609," Did you know in the x-files aliens begin their colonization of earth on December 22, 2012?",11/11/2002 2:06
929,929," I had no idea! I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens.",8/27/1974 11:14
929,929, I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. ,12/29/1996 4:14
929,609," It is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens.",10/3/2003 12:38
929,929," Crazy, what religion is he? ",9/1/2021 15:38
929,929," Scientology. It's a mix of sci-fi and self help, with a nice dose of pyramid scheme added in. ",2/12/1973 2:08
929,609," Oh yeah, I've seen shows on that. That is crazy. I wonder if they could make a franchise out of that similar to the Alien's movie franchise. ",1/29/1977 6:56
930,930," With aliens from the deep? I'd love that. Of course, the Scientology aliens come from volcanoes, which is a whole other...thing.",9/6/2003 21:13
930,341, That would be a pretty cool movie. They could even have a cameo from Bill Nye the science guy!,3/30/2008 2:24
930,341," Aw, he's the best! He's the executive director of the Planetary Society! I love astronomy.",6/27/1993 11:10
930,341, I used to watch his show a lot. Did you know that the Ancient babylonians had a sophisticated understanding of astronomy? ,11/2/1997 9:23
930,930," I'm not surprised. Once you observe the sky regularly, you start to see where everything is. I'd like to go to the place in Iran they call astronomy town. They've cut back on light pollution to see the sky better. ",4/3/1999 14:05
930,341, Interesting. Were you aware that only 7% of people read the ToA for a product off of the internet. Seems a bit high to me. ,3/27/1989 20:41
930,341," That seems like an optimistic number! I don't think I've ever read it. Now, if the library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet saved, does the internet have a copy of all the things in the library of Alexandria?",10/18/2010 13:16
930,341," Interesting, the wayback machine might actually have that.",8/3/2008 4:49
930,930," I'd forgotten about the wayback machine! I hope my old website hasn't been saved. Though it's nice to know that I could read it from atop Mt. Everest, if I had to. Can you imagine being up there and wanting to be on the internet?",4/24/1977 12:26
930,341, I would never climb up there. I'm scared of heights. But that is interesting that there is 3g service up there. ,3/27/2001 9:12
931,931, I wouldn't either. It's amazing how interconnected our lives are because of the internet. The whole world was reshaped because of it.,10/23/1999 21:35
931,1584," yeah, that is pretty cool. But the internet is addictive. ",11/25/2013 7:12
931,1584, It certainly is! I just want to click through everything and learn just enough things to be a know it all.,2/3/1980 6:16
931,1584, I think a lot of people do. The longest name in the world is a story about a shepherd apparently. ,9/13/2013 3:43
931,931," Hi what arts do you enjoy? Music, Literature, etc?",5/9/2003 20:35
931,1584, Hello - I enjoy it all. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?,10/20/1980 9:27
931,1584, That is amazing. Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year,9/28/1972 11:41
931,1584, Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park. ,5/1/2010 13:17
931,931, Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing,12/5/2004 8:37
931,1584, I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today.,1/4/1989 17:19
932,1045, Isn't there also one in pompeii? I believe pink floyd performed there,6/13/1999 2:44
932,932," Yes, I've seen the Pink Floyd performance in Pompeii. ",8/3/2015 17:45
932,1045, Do you mean the recording? I believe that had no audience on site,1/7/2016 23:24
932,932," Yes, I saw the recording of it. ",10/7/1994 1:09
932,1045, Did you like it?,8/3/1998 10:53
932,932, Yea it was pretty good. Do you like poetry?,7/3/1977 0:45
932,932, I enjoy my fair share. There are many different types of poetry though,11/14/2013 5:54
932,932," Yes there is a lot. There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards, is inspiring.",11/22/1988 2:43
932,932, That in itself is inspiring. Much like saying there is two sides to every story,9/29/2006 11:02
932,1045," Yep. The Japanese alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem.",1/29/2004 17:00
933,933, Are you familiar with palindromes?,11/23/1996 9:25
933,933, I am not. Do you know a lot about them?,7/21/1984 0:40
933,933," Palindromes are a series of words that are the same read forward or backwards. Understanding that, you must understand how hard it must have been for Demetri Martin to write a 224 word palindrome poem.",9/3/1974 16:58
933,1218, Oh wow ok. I bet that was a challenge then!,11/3/1983 12:31
933,933," Indeed! In any case, thanks for chatting.",4/4/1977 17:38
933,933, Do you like concerts? ,2/20/1977 9:08
933,1218, Sometimes don't really get out much though. What kind of concerts? ,2/3/2019 1:21
933,1218," I like the Ramones to be honest, what about you? ",3/23/2015 1:08
933,933, Everybody loves Raymond!,5/18/2020 23:54
933,933, Hilarious. Do you play violin? ,2/6/1970 18:15
934,934," Nope, i don't play any instrument. Do you?",11/28/1973 13:55
934,66," I play guitar, piano, and drums. I grew up playing mozart, no lie. ",3/6/2000 4:59
934,66, Wow that's awesome. I do love music though. I mostly listen to instrumentals. Violin and electric guitar sounds great together. ,6/12/2020 14:27
934,934," Yeah, they are great. I didn't know that some violins could be upwards of $1 mill. ",8/16/1996 16:39
934,66, That's ridiculous especially since modern violins were preferred to Stradivarius ones when blind tested. ,7/4/2017 2:22
934,66," What about poetry, do you like it? ",12/13/2017 20:54
934,934, Well i use to write a little when i was younger. What about you?,5/16/1990 18:54
934,934, Not really to be honest. ,11/16/1997 21:03
934,66, There is a poem that when read forward is depressing but when read backward is inspiring. ,3/11/1972 8:22
934,934, Did E.E. Cummings write it? ,4/25/2003 16:38
935,935, Not sure who wrote it but i would like to read it. Did you know that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year?,4/20/2005 18:09
935,935," I did, they were good. ",11/24/2009 2:22
935,331, Yeah i like them too. shame how things went down. Wow i didn't realize that law suits could be filled if a concert was  bad.,8/14/1984 20:56
935,331," Yeah, I heard about that with Creed. They aren't the best, in my opinion. ",7/6/2010 18:51
935,935, Yeah not like Pink floyd!,12/24/1980 9:51
935,331, Nice chatting with you.,5/27/1991 10:52
935,331, Hello! Are you interested in poetry at all?,4/10/2019 2:56
935,935," Hi! Poetry is ok, not really my thing. I read poems in school. Nowadays, I don't. I prefer novels. You?",8/12/1979 6:49
935,935, I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards.,7/10/2021 5:41
935,331, That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of The Raven. I wonder if he got royalties.,7/27/1984 13:52
936,840," That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly. Once I read a 224 word long poem, that turns out to be an entire palindrome!",8/28/1992 9:21
936,936, HOw long did it take to write that poem? It sounds like something that would require a computer. I wonder if it's a pretty poem.,3/21/1982 15:17
936,840," I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order.",5/11/2006 17:46
936,840, I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much?,10/30/2001 23:17
936,840," Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year.",2/16/1984 18:36
936,840," They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that.",10/8/1985 21:37
936,936," Oh I'm sure it must have been exhausting. Then again imagine the Ramones, they played 2,263 concerts total over 20 years, that's insane!",6/5/2010 11:31
936,936, The Ramones must have discovered the secret of youth. How could they maintain that pace? Their fans must love them.,1/7/1995 15:56
936,936, I'm sure they appreciated them like crazy for doing that. On the other hand I remember there was a Creed concert that was so awful that people actually filed a lawsuit against them.,7/13/2009 12:01
936,840, Creed must have done something so bad for their own fans to sue them. Did they won? Does it matter? I hope they learned a lesson.,8/27/2014 21:42
937,847," I have no idea, I'd guess they didn't win. Maybe it was the fault of the theater and not Creed? Like there's an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia, I bet the acoustics there are awful.",6/20/2007 17:18
937,937, I bet it wouldn't matter for Creed. They would get sued no matter where they played. I wonder if the Ramones ever played in Croatia.,11/24/1971 5:35
937,847, Well I know Pink Ployd recorded a live concert at a different Roman amphitheater in Pompeii! Then again there was no audience so who knows how good it really was.,8/31/2018 14:16
937,847," It was probably ok, but was it necessary? Why that amphitheater? Then again, they were artists. Who knows what they want.",9/4/1977 13:57
937,937, Yeah people have interesting choices for sure. Have you ever been to a violin concert?,12/11/2002 18:17
937,847," I have been to the symphony, but not concerts for violins specifically.",5/10/1997 0:02
937,847, Neither have I! But I think it would be an experience for sure. There's a musical piece where artists gradually leave the stage until only two violinists are remaining.,9/21/1997 12:03
937,937," That's interesting. I wonder what it sounds like. Very modern, I suppose. I wonder what a violin made out of stone sounds like. It probably rocks pretty hard.",10/4/1970 13:45
937,847," Haha definitely it would be nice to see that at a concert. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a nice night!",1/21/2013 18:02
937,847," Hi, how are you? Do you like to use the Internet?",2/13/2022 20:23
938,938, Hey. Yes I love the Internet. They carry so much information and resources and services.,7/28/2015 10:08
938,938," i worry about the internet. i think that it could be addictive and that i might lose myself in it. the clicking, the constant clicking.",6/6/1993 7:15
938,938, That is definitely a valid concern. What is weird is that humans are the minority on the Internet outnumbered by automated software programs.,3/14/1977 9:38
938,938, i did not know that. we are monitored all the time. even these very chats that we do could be handled by bots in the future. then what?,6/9/2022 5:00
938,1677, Yes that's a good question I'm not sure what would happen then. One cool thing is that in Finland everyone has the right to an Internet connection.,1/1/1985 13:19
938,938, i think that is great. people need to be connected for work and school and also to make friends. maybe not bot friends though.,6/24/2006 20:40
938,938, Agreed. When people look themselves up on the internet it is called egosurfing. I wonder if bots egosurf lol?,10/31/2002 6:55
938,1677, that would be funny. comparing themselves to other bots. the narcissstic bot. that would be their downfall,7/5/1977 6:13
938,938, Yeah it would! What is crazy is that astronauts in space have faster internet than most american homes!,7/13/1994 12:39
938,1677, that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials?,4/8/2007 17:15
939,939, Yeah true. I do although we have never made contact. Even the ancient greeks wrote stories about them!,4/7/1981 16:39
939,939," i guess the skies seemed mysterious to them too. what is up there past the stars? they must have wondered. i figure that one day we will make contact, but not the way we expect.",11/1/2005 10:17
939,939, Yeah I don't think we will. The president of the world chess federation believe chess was invented by aliens. That is certainly an odd theory lol.,8/4/2016 10:07
939,1109," why aliens? it is not such a strange game. simple pieces, simple board, simple moves. complex strategy.",12/28/2011 21:27
939,939, Yes my thoughts precisely. Well at least we are prepared. The UN has a contingency plan just in case!,3/20/2014 7:19
939,939, I dont have too much faith in that. the UN doesnt speak alien. And they would probably protect themselves.,11/7/2004 5:56
939,939, Yeah agreed. Maybe the USA needs its own plan? The sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory has aliens!,6/30/2019 18:37
939,1109," What? that is strange. Aliens in a chocolate factory? Why? I guess the kids like aliens? Why not zombies? Anyway, great chat!",10/12/2012 4:11
939,939, Haha yes I question that same thing. They are all hypothetical life forms indeed. You have yourself a good rest of the day now.,2/8/2008 10:23
939,939," Thanks, you too. Take care!",2/28/2008 18:58
940,940, Bye now! Also the vatican owns its own observatory. I wonder if its secretly for finding aliens...,7/22/1974 12:49
940,1833," Hello, do you like Astronomy?",3/20/1989 5:51
940,1833," I do, but do not follow it closely.  I did have the good fortune of seeing the 2012 annular eclipse when I was on a consulting assignment in Utah.  And you?",1/9/1979 11:21
940,940," I also enjoy it when I can.  A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision! ",5/16/1982 2:30
940,940, Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory! ,4/19/1982 10:05
940,940," I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery.",12/18/1986 3:00
940,940, I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right?,1/25/1987 1:31
940,940," I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.  ",12/17/2008 23:54
940,940," LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!  Did you happen to hear about the criminal investigation that shut down the Sunspot Observatory in NM?",6/27/1985 17:17
940,1833," I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.  I know there were theories of Aliens?",7/6/1996 7:19
941,941," Well, it was not E.T downloading illegal materials; it was the janitor!  I am glad the facility director got the FBI involved.",1/10/1972 10:18
941,941, Definitely glad the FBI got involved!  That janitor claimed someone been entering there to steal their internet service!  Lol I don't think E.T would stop there now!,4/17/1981 15:22
941,941," Thankfully that is over and the observatory is back up and running.  And, I hope they have upgraded their internet security!  Do you think there is life out there that we do not yet know about?",8/17/2014 2:04
941,340," I do think how vast the galaxies are, that there has to be life somewhere else!  In the X-Files aliens started to colonize Earth in 2012.  That hasn't happened yet!",7/10/1975 6:49
941,941, I find it interesting that the U.N. already has a contingency plan in the event aliens do make contact.  People have been fantasizing about forever; an ancient Greek wrote about plant like aliens on the moon over 1800 years ago!,5/18/2001 18:17
941,340," Wow that is a long time ago, and where humans were thinking about that!  Tom Cruise believes in aliens, he built an underground bunker to protect himself from E.T.",2/27/1993 17:09
941,941," Tom Cruise may be a popular actor but he also has very unique beliefs!  Perhaps aliens are already here spying on us!  Did you know that humans are a minority  on the internet, being outnumbered by bots? Perhaps some are there collect info for their home world? LOL",10/13/2003 23:07
941,340, Lol!!  I did not know that!  Starting to get me thinking now!  I do know I am one of the 7% that do try my best to read the full terms when buying something on the internet.  lol,6/4/1979 15:46
941,941," I buy from a few online vendors who's terms I have read.  While I may find a cheaper price at an unknown ecommerce site, is it real and what are the terms.  Online, I do occasionally play chess with other players from around the world.  Did you know the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens?",7/17/1970 16:30
941,941," No I did not!  Seems like a lot of people out there believe in alien life!  Well anyways, it was nice talking to you!  Have a great day!!",8/2/2021 8:30
942,942," The internet may have a dark side, but I like the positive things it has done, like facilitating the sharing of knowledge.  I like using the online star charts to help understand the night sky from time to time.  I might do that tonight!  Take care...",6/28/1970 20:05
942,1543, Thank you you also!,2/11/1976 1:50
942,942, Hi!  Are you a fan of cats?,6/11/2005 11:49
942,942," Yea cats are awesome, in japan and taiwan they have cat cafes where you can have drinks and pet cats",7/23/2017 20:08
942,1543, That is pretty cool.  It is crazy to think that when a cat reaches 15 years old it has spent 10 years of its life sleeping.,7/31/1987 21:29
942,942, Sound like the life to be able to be able to sleep 10 years out of 15 like cats too,1/21/2003 8:11
942,942," They are pretty lucky that way.  There is a cat that is published, but only because a physicist listed him as the co author so he could write in first person.",5/16/1983 1:39
942,1543, Lol thats pretty cool but not as cool as Talkeetna Mayor Stubbs,6/9/1991 13:59
942,1543, Mayor Cat?  Hmm...  hed probably put nap time as mandatory.  I could get behind that.,11/17/2014 11:59
942,1543, He has been a mayor since 1997 so he has spent at least 10 years of his tenure sleeping,1/6/1997 11:08
943,1902," He probably has, that is crazy.  I wonder how that happened?",3/3/1977 18:15
943,943, Maybe there is a large feral cat population up there,9/2/1984 11:01
943,943, That is partly how the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather was a stray on the set.,12/19/2008 23:47
943,1902," Yea there are a lot of cats, the only pet with higher numbers are fish",7/29/2015 5:36
943,1902," Kinda crazy, to think that there are that many cats in the world.",9/26/2000 14:38
943,1902, Theres a lot of cats and they are successful in many environments despite of 80 percent of the earth's natural forest being destroyed,8/3/1994 17:30
943,1902, I know for the short time humans have been on earth we have certainly destroyed a lot of the earth.  There wont even be any helium left at the end of the 21st centruy,7/17/1978 3:14
943,1902," I wonder what is causing the earth to be helium-free by the end of the century, i guess there won't be many ballons left",5/8/2015 9:22
943,1902," True, we should probably conserve that now.",3/10/1983 13:53
943,943," Maybe the UN should try to do something about, sounds more important than appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestirals",10/12/2005 14:03
944,443, I wonder if that position will ever be used.  I would feel somewhat silly telling people that is my job.,7/18/2001 19:53
944,443," An extraterrestrial ambassador sounds like a sweet job, or a good bar story",1/24/1981 20:42
944,944, You could win tons of bets.  Tell people you have the most outlandish job. Wins everytime,1/14/2010 11:12
944,944," lol i guess so. Well i got to go, nice talking with you",11/1/1990 11:40
944,443," Hi, how are you? What do you think of this planet of ours?",4/12/1972 3:28
944,944," Hello, Great! Its very interesting!! Its upsetting about our natural forests being destroyed!",10/17/2008 23:08
944,944, Ithink that we will destroy them all within the next 100 years. We cannot slow down. We want more and more,3/23/1976 6:50
944,443," Could be, very sad! I hope not though.",10/24/2014 6:28
944,944, Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go?,8/31/2014 20:15
944,443," I know, where? Interesting when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long!",12/22/1985 7:03
945,370, Now it's longer and getting even longer. Soon the workday will be 20 hours. I will retire then.,3/20/1974 6:32
945,370," lol, good idea!! We have a time change on the 10th of March!",4/2/1986 1:55
945,370, I totally forgot. I guess that I will lose an hour of sleep. Doh. ,4/12/1990 19:55
945,945," Yeah, spring forward.  Do you like superhero's like Wonder woman?",12/6/1975 13:08
945,370, I like Wonder Woman. I did not see the recent film. I heard it was good.,3/19/2022 1:49
945,945," I didn't either, Gal Gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman, she thought it was for cat woman!",6/6/2018 22:17
945,370, That's great! She looks like Wonder Woman. She is in great shape and has the look. ,5/28/2020 18:12
945,945, I think so. She's perfect for the part! I do like cat woman though too!,9/12/2015 14:05
945,945," She would do well in that too. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941, the group made her their secretary. That is pretty sexist! But typical for the day.",6/21/2014 3:37
945,945, I was thinking the same thing! In 1953 Winston Churchill won a Nobel prize in literature.,4/4/1989 21:34
946,946, I guess he was good at telling stories. I never knew that. He was quite a leader. I guess I should check out his works.,11/15/2021 17:14
946,946," Yes, he was half American and half British! ",5/28/1970 21:12
946,946," Yes, I believe he got honorary citizenship or something. I dont remember. Anyway, great chat!",12/19/2011 14:45
946,946," Yes, have a good night!! Good chat!",11/12/1975 13:32
946,1576, Good night!,8/31/2001 9:07
946,1576, You too!,2/9/2014 4:16
946,946," Hi, how are you?",12/29/2019 16:45
946,946, im great! how are you? do you like snakes?,11/20/1976 0:00
946,1576, Not really. I could move to new zealand and never see them again. What about you?,3/18/1986 0:20
946,1576, i dont like snakes but i dont hate. they are to be respected. they are part of nature,8/6/1995 8:49
947,1752, There is a genus of flying snakes! Nope!,6/19/2012 13:29
947,1752, That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia,7/19/2018 13:27
947,947," Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky!",4/28/1994 18:33
947,947," yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL",2/16/2002 7:59
947,947, Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too!,11/21/1994 11:17
947,1752," monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes.",1/9/1982 3:13
947,947, I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards.,9/3/2011 21:53
947,1752," i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much?",4/9/2002 10:41
947,947, I do. Do you go to concerts much?,11/12/2004 1:49
947,947, I used to go quite a bit when i was younger. now i dont really go. no time or money. ,6/16/2014 17:08
948,1051, I do not like the crowds any more. I like smaller venues and local music.,9/17/1995 9:23
948,948, i dont like crowds either. not very intimate. i do like sitting near the stage and seeing the musicians up close.,3/22/1996 13:59
948,948," I am more of a bar guy at the bar, just listening and relaxing.",10/7/2005 13:23
948,948," yeah, i hear you. music to unwind. not dealing with crowds and hassles. would you ever sue a band for a bad performance? i wonder how mad i would have to be.",5/17/2013 1:19
948,948, Are you talking about Creed? I remember that on the news and I laughed out loud because that is something I can see scott stapp doing.,4/27/1987 3:02
948,948, they must have sucked incredibly to drive people to a lawsuit. they probably should have practiced a bit before touring.,5/31/1971 3:18
948,948," He got stupid drunk before the show, passed out after 15 minutes, and then the show ended. Once he was sued, he called it performance art. Such a waste...",11/21/2009 12:48
948,948," thats terrible. the guy has a drinking problem and needs help. Anyway, great chat!",5/17/1992 9:03
948,1051, Ditto! Have a great day!,4/27/1996 19:14
948,1051, Hi do you like Wonder woman movie,2/1/2010 9:23
949,949," Yea, Patty Jenkins did a great job directing Wonder Woman",12/1/1993 18:13
949,304, Yes pretty good one in the DC universe,6/22/1977 10:52
949,949," Yea, Gal Gadot was a perfect casting choice to play Wonder Woman",2/14/1999 20:02
949,949, Yes she is perfect. during audition she was not aware that she is auditioning for Wonder woman,2/20/2015 4:06
949,304, I never knew that. I also didn't know Wonder Woman's first film appearance was in the Lego Movie,11/17/1982 0:41
949,304, Gal gadot has seved in israel defence force . I thought she was paegent queen,8/13/1974 23:18
949,949, That is pretty cool. Did you know Wonder Woman was the justice Society's secretary in 1941?,3/23/1997 8:12
949,949, no but it was the highest superhero origin movie. may be marvel movie may break this record soon,1/5/1999 14:04
949,304, Probably. Do you read literature? It used to be an olympic event,4/12/2002 14:25
949,949, Yes had read few .  but FDA has burned 6 tons of literature in act of censorship. I dont think that was a good act ,8/22/1976 12:22
950,950," That is very strange, not as strange as the heavy metal as a form of literature course taught at Texas A&M",10/19/2015 8:46
950,375, not they are in electronic form and burning is not that easy poor FDA,4/12/1993 0:00
950,950," That is odd, I wonder if it had to do with the recent development of Romantic Kissing in literature",2/21/2008 3:33
950,950, do you know that Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature,7/22/2000 22:38
950,950," No, I figured he would win for peace, not literature",1/25/1985 19:55
950,950, some things are hard to believe . Earth;s day was 5.5 hrs long when formed,11/8/2020 17:08
950,375," That's pretty crazy, plus earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,000 years",9/3/2017 1:52
950,375, Gravitional interaction between Earth and Moon gradually slows its rotation,12/6/1980 2:49
950,950," Crazy, did you know earth is 4x as dense as sun? well nice talking with you",8/28/1991 18:17
950,950, . We even have a ambassador for extra terrestrials .Nice talking to you,1/20/2013 9:40
951,1073, Have a good one,12/14/1997 14:54
951,1073, Do you like poetry? ,7/17/1977 23:34
951,951," I'm not too into them. I heard that Ursula K Le Guin who is known for her science fiction and fantasy novels, finshed a collection of poetry before her death.",2/27/1994 4:21
951,951, Wow i did not know that. Did you know that Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem?,8/17/1983 10:21
951,951," Interesting! Le Guin, in her poem Normal talks about not feeling bad to crush others to achieve goals. But the poem wanted to demonstrat that we should not let destructive attitudes prevail",4/7/2002 0:18
951,951, ok. You know how much the famus author Edgar Allen poe received for the publication of the raven?,6/24/1971 13:15
951,951," It was $9. Depressing! Speaking of depressing, there is one  poem that when read normally is depressing but read backwards is inspiring.",2/27/2019 4:47
951,1073, Wow that's one i would like to read. Have you ever seen the movie the hobbit?,9/10/1977 18:15
951,951, I think I have. There is a book of poems by Emily Jungmin Yoon that seems quite depressing-it is about Korean comfort women in WWII in Japanese occupied territories.,12/4/1989 21:34
951,951, Wow that most be a heart wrenching read. I asked about the hobbit because almost all the characters are named that were taken from an old Iceland poem Dvergatal.,9/26/1988 4:33
952,305, Nice. Some poetry that i would like to learn more about is the javanese alphabet. It actually forms a poem when recited in order,4/10/1994 1:21
952,305, Now that is unique. Poetry has a long history dating back to prehistoric times. ,8/28/1974 20:23
952,305," Oh, how far back do they go?",3/26/1973 3:06
952,952, Well in Africa they used it while hunting.,3/2/2017 18:57
952,952, Very cool. It seems humans have always used poetry to explore a deeper meaning in life,7/2/2022 20:08
952,305, Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among pyramids text written during the 25th century bc.,3/12/1979 9:48
952,305," People search for truth through literature, like Wiman, an editor of Poetry magazine, who suffers from blood cancer.",11/11/1996 0:59
952,305, Wow i did not know that. are you a cat lover?,1/27/1988 10:00
952,952," I am not though I have a stray cat that is annoyingly cute that comes around and cuddles with me. Speaking of which, the cat in the Godfather opening scene was a stray that was found on set.",10/14/1980 22:44
952,305, I hole they at least feed him. Apparently there a cat named Stubbs as the major of Talkeetna Alaska since 1997.,10/25/1996 19:55
953,965, That is interesting.,1/18/2002 2:49
953,965, To say the least! When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of it sleeping. ,1/19/1984 10:57
953,965," Ah, that is the life! I would love to go to a cat cafe where I could relax with cats and have a drink.",12/22/1993 11:52
953,953, Hi. I think it's so fascinating to learn facts about the earth. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st-century. I wonder what is causing that?,3/21/2020 2:03
953,953, Good question! Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day!,8/8/2007 20:17
953,953, Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,11/4/1994 12:31
953,953, That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed!,4/27/1982 11:42
953,953," That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least.",9/20/2013 14:20
953,953, Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us?,10/25/1974 17:51
953,965, I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship.,7/18/1978 14:14
954,1976, That is absurd! I love how there is a literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel.,8/14/1985 1:25
954,954, That is very funny I would love to read some of those sentences. One surprising thing is that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even an ancient Greek literature.,1/15/2013 21:33
954,954, Very interesting. Love how Churchill won a nobel peace prize in literature and not peace.,2/26/2016 18:47
954,954, Yeah that is very interesting and something I did not know. He was a very smart man. Pretty cool he was  able to accomplish that back in 1953.,6/20/2019 11:48
954,1976, Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie?,8/17/1989 16:23
954,1976, Yes I have it I thought it was really cool. Gal Gadot did a great job. DC comics must've been very impressed.,1/6/1983 13:58
954,1976, Definitely! She actually served in the Israeli Defense Forces for 2 years.,9/11/1978 22:26
954,1976, Wow she is really an amazing woman. Explains why the fight scenes were so realistic. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the Justice society in 1941 the group made her their secretary. Oh how times have changed.,10/18/1994 17:35
954,954, I did not know it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie!,8/27/1986 4:59
954,954, Yeah that is a huge accomplishment wow. It is also the highest grossing world war one movie.,3/18/2015 16:33
955,955, Very impressive. I really did like that movie.,3/14/1975 1:39
955,138, Yes it was a great one. 2017 was also a great year for movies and it was the first year since 1958 that the top three highest grossing domestic films were female lead.,6/11/2003 6:29
955,955, Makes sense! Gal did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought it was Catwoman!,1/23/1992 20:40
955,955, Ha ha that is hilarious.Patty Jenkins was a great director of that movie. Well it was nice chatting with you have a good day.,12/24/2017 17:41
955,138, What are your thought on Tina Turner? I think she is really talented,3/19/1990 22:49
955,138," I remember her from childhood,  I definitely think she is super talented!  Such a unique voice.  Have you ever been to her concert? I hear Linkin park did 324 concerts in one year!  ",6/21/1972 20:41
955,955," Thats a lot like 1 concert per day if you exclude holidays, seems like a big toll on the band",7/17/1994 0:10
955,955," I know right!  crazy!  also the ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts! ",6/20/1990 15:31
955,138," A total of 2,263 concerts! wow, that must have taken them years,",1/26/1970 4:51
955,955, Yeah its basically like they toured for over 20 years!  ,1/6/1986 3:53
956,956," Oh that makes sense but still, 226 concerts per year is a lot, I wonder why they made it",9/18/2021 4:36
956,1117," Probably for the money lol that must be taxing on your body and mental health too,  thats like a non stop party for 20 years ugh. ",4/15/2013 13:31
956,1117," Yeah, sounds demanding, so do you like the Walt Disney Company?",3/3/1988 17:00
956,1117," Absolutely,  I love Disney.  Do you?",8/14/1986 9:29
956,1117," I love Disney as well, one of my favorite movies Big Hero 6, ",4/18/2018 23:43
956,1117," Nice!  I have so many,  little mermaid, aladdin,  lion king, inside out,  wreck it ralph,  incredibles, frozen, moana.",3/28/1981 23:09
956,1117," Those are awesome movies as well, interesting fact about Big Hero 6, the movie was made with a super computer, 55000 cores",10/22/1982 16:25
956,1117," wow!  Thats amazing.  I like the city it is based in, san fransokyo lol ",4/5/1988 11:00
956,1117," I like it too, a lot of creativity in the movie, another interesting fact is that minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse",9/16/1985 8:46
956,956, I guess that makes sense!  Never thought it was short for anything lol ,5/7/1997 7:34
957,1397," That was a new fact for me as well, do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?",7/30/1976 2:27
957,1397," Yes,  I do remember him,  they guy who looks like steve martin haha",10/17/1970 11:21
957,1397," Yeah the same one lol, well he was the science consultant in the movie Flubber",1/2/1999 9:06
957,1397, Thats awesome! The wall-e movie name is a tip of the hat to walt disney.,3/3/1975 13:22
957,957," It is, I didnt like that movie much but the name is nice. ",6/25/2016 4:25
957,1397, Have you ever seen the film Wonder Woman?,11/8/1994 3:17
957,957, I havent. I do want to though.,7/8/1989 21:25
957,957," Yeah, it's an ok film, it's actually produced by DC Entertainment, I think I'm a fan of Marvel more though.",12/27/1990 11:23
957,957, I think I like Marvel better too.  My favorite of all time is Deadpool though.,1/18/2011 18:05
957,957," Oh, I love that character! But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie!",3/25/1997 3:53
958,554," Wow, even higher than all the Batmans?",8/25/1979 13:19
958,958," Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces?",8/5/2014 11:38
958,554, That is cool that she served.  She seems to be a good role model for young girls.,5/12/2017 20:22
958,958," She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know?",2/22/2016 6:14
958,958," I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet.",11/13/1987 12:02
958,554," Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip",1/28/2006 1:55
958,554," That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace?",7/31/2014 21:16
958,554, Oh really? Did he publish something to warrant the prize?,4/17/1970 12:59
958,554, I think he did.  Dont know what though.,12/9/2021 12:20
958,958," There's an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with worst possible opening sentences to novels, I wonder why, any guesses?",9/17/1971 22:40
959,1659," I think there is a contest for that.  Man, that must be fun to judge.",8/22/2010 9:42
959,959, Yeah seriously and very entertaining too! Romantic kissing was only a fairly recent development! How is that possible!,10/2/1990 5:03
959,959, I dont know! I thought that was around for ages.,8/31/2010 15:16
959,959, Seriously! Maybe that's why the FDA burned six tons of literature! But why does the FDA have jurisdiction over censorship of literature? ,11/17/1979 21:59
959,959, Thats a good question. I am against all censorship.,4/4/1983 0:21
959,959," Me too, but maybe times have changed since then!",1/5/2007 1:43
959,959, Hey!  Do you enjoy Poetry?  It's a form of literature that uses aesthetic and the rhythmic attributes of language.,4/22/1977 6:02
959,1659," Hello there, yes I do enjoy some poetry for sure, how about yourself?  ",5/21/1974 12:29
959,959, I do too!  I've even read some hunting poetry from Africa.,10/20/1990 7:02
959,959, That sounds very interesting.  Did you know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for his The Raven poem?  ,8/23/2008 19:56
960,596, No that is amazing!  I remember reading that in High Shool.,2/19/2006 13:52
960,596, Yeah I will always remember that poem from a halloween episode of the Simpsons.  ,2/19/2013 3:39
960,596," Some of the earliest written poetry comes from Africa, around the 25th century BCE. ",10/26/1972 12:07
960,960, I am really interested in reading some of that it sounds so cool.  ,7/14/1988 0:53
960,960, Do you like astronomy?  I have always found Earth fascinating.  It was formed 4.5 billion years ago!  That's so old!,9/15/2009 21:16
960,960," Yeah I love learning and reading about it, so cool.  That is old!  Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free? ",8/15/2005 18:52
960,596," I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed.",4/11/1989 15:10
960,596," Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed. ",7/4/1987 0:24
960,960," We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours!",12/25/2012 10:52
960,596, That is crazy to think how much longer the days are now.  Imagine going back to 5.5 days! You would feel like you lived a lifetime in a week lol. ,8/25/1985 0:05
961,961, If earth's  history was viewed in a 24 hour period.  Humans would only represent about 1 minute and 17 seconds.  Shows you how young we really are!,8/20/1998 4:55
961,961, Yeah that really makes you think!  Did you know that 71% of the earth's surface is covered by water?,6/24/1997 16:43
961,1632, Yea I have heard that.  And the remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands. ,9/30/1987 10:59
961,961, Yeah its just crazy thinking how vast the oceans really are.  Did you know that we live on the densest planet in the solar system?,1/26/2008 13:50
961,1632, No I didnt.  I would have thought it would have been Jupiter or something.,8/16/1978 23:24
961,1632," Yeah same here, I would never had guessed that it was earth, so interesting. ",5/11/1974 5:33
961,1632," Are you a Cat person?  Did you know when a cat is 15 years old, they have spent about 10 years of that sleeping?",10/20/1990 13:24
961,1632," No, but I don't mind them.  That is astonishing, I guess they like to sleep a lot.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. ",10/28/1979 19:56
961,1632, Are you afraid of snakes?,1/16/2018 12:11
961,961, To be honest yes and I was born and raised in the country.,10/14/2005 10:07
962,962," I am afraid of snakes too so no judging here, I think its a rational fear ",12/29/2002 15:13
962,962," Yes, I have a close friend raise snakes, he or she wouldn't never have to worry about me visiting, Hahaha.",2/24/2018 1:00
962,962," Yeah I would stay as far as possible as well lol, a place to go if you hate snakes is New Zealand",5/4/2016 8:55
962,962," Yes you are right, some snakes are poisonous and some are helpful, they eat other snakes and Insects.",9/20/1984 4:36
962,962," There is a breed of flying snakes, that would be really scary like 5 times more scary than a regular snake",3/31/2022 3:07
962,1934," Yes you are right, I heard a friend of mine that worked with wildlife said that snakes are more afraid of human as well.",10/14/2018 21:13
962,962," Are they? maybe there just pretending lol, so enough of snakes, do you like music? concerts?",9/4/2019 12:14

963,1918," I cant, thats a lot of concerts, thats almost a concert a day if you dont count holidays, ",7/3/1985 2:47
963,1918," Where do these performance get their energy from, I am tired after doing one song when I am in church.",11/30/1985 15:47
963,963," Probably a lot of drugs, that can be really helpful or so Ive heard",8/17/2001 13:48
963,1918," Yes I agree with you, I am not familiar with the group The ramones is this an all male group or male and female?",7/10/1978 7:38
963,1918," It was a male band, they all had Ramon as one of their names, not sure if they were family or if it was because of their artistic names",5/16/1994 6:11
963,963, Wow that's embarrassment in 2002 a creed concert was so bad four concert doers filed a lawsuit against the band.,1/4/2000 0:11
963,1918," I used to like that band a lot, too bad the concert was so bad they got sued, the band used to have a lot of talent and a couple of great songs",12/29/1996 22:18
963,1918," They must have party all that night before the concert, many of these band members have problems like everyone else, sometime we all have bad days.",8/26/2018 18:04
963,1918," I guess they all had a pretty bad day the night or evening of the concert, I still like their songs though. ",3/17/1996 4:41
963,963, Do you like to read? Seems like Woman Who Fly is a great book,10/9/1989 14:56

964,1098," Its about tales of flying woman, mythologies, visions of female freedom and emancipation, seems like a book with a really original plot",5/23/1971 11:36
964,1098, That sounds pretty cool and like something I would like. Did you know earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun?,1/12/1980 8:03

964,1098, That is crazy. There is a region in Canada with less gravity than the rest of the earth. ,9/18/2015 15:02
964,1098," There is? I guess theres a lot more to earth than what meets the eye, im just glad 71% of earth is water, I love water, the sea, rivers",12/18/1998 22:47
964,1098," I love water regions too, especially the ocean. You could fit all the planets between the moon and the earth and still have room.",4/11/2016 7:26
964,1098," Amazing and it looks so close you raise your arm and try to touch it, days at earth when it first got formed were only 5.5 hours long",1/13/2020 22:34
964,964, Thats pretty short. And I thought they were too short in the winter! Do you like to read?,10/21/1990 14:54

965,561," Thats interesting, literature, music, painting used to be events in the Olympic games. ",9/27/1985 21:33
965,561, I can't imagine what olympic painting was like! I wonder why they stopped doing it.,12/5/1997 20:53
965,965," That is hard too imagine I agree, maybe thats why they took them out of the games in 1952",2/14/2001 8:28
965,561," Yeah, maybe. The latin word for literature is derived from the word letter.",1/9/2014 0:38

968,968," It seems like it would be called that. Someone told me there's several in my area, but I've never seen one. ",2/8/1984 13:33
968,79, I would not want to. I hear there are snakes that appear to fly. Is that true?,5/20/2020 7:05
968,79," That would be very, very scary. ",2/20/1987 22:05
968,968," I should probably move to new Zealand, they don't have any snakes there.",8/11/2019 21:22
968,79, That would be nice. Well I have to run. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good night!,11/21/1986 13:35
968,79," Hi, do you use Netflix?",4/12/1994 20:56
968,79," I am a subscriber yes, do you?",12/8/2015 3:07
969,1684," I used to. I don't now. As of October 2018, Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide, including 58.46 million in the United States. Amazing!",1/2/2011 14:56
969,969," I know, a lot of people subscribe to the service, still Netflix has a huge deficit",4/2/2018 11:43
969,1684, I guess they have been spending tons of money. I know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,7/28/1989 0:41
969,969, I wonder why? isnt there whole business model online?,7/25/1987 19:07
969,1684," I guess some parts of the country have little bandwidth. People need DVDs and such. Still, many online users. From 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america.",2/1/1987 12:24
969,1684," So Netflix also has the DVD service, interesting, I guess every subscriber counts, still seems a bit excessive, 20 more times!!!! and wow 33% really?",7/16/2012 11:22
969,1684, It seems to work. Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,1/4/2011 9:40
969,969," They have $21.9 billion in debt, not sure if its a giant anymore, theres also new streaming services out there that are a threat to Netflix",1/4/1996 18:29
969,969," I expect them to have competitors. After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of Apollo 13, Reed Hastings was inspired to start netflix. Someone else will get inspired to take on Netflix.",1/27/1973 2:33
969,1684," Blockbuster gave Reed the knife then, they did charge excessive fees.",3/30/1973 14:02
970,970," Probably a big part of their business model. Then they thought they could beat Netflix at the online game. Now they're gone! Bye bye, BB",6/7/1984 14:03
970,140," I guess the lack of vision really affected the company in end, tech keeps on advancing and businesses have to adapt in order to survive, but anyways do you like the Star Wars franchise?",7/13/1985 23:41
970,140," Yes, I do. It's interesting that James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines and was paid $7,500",6/14/2015 3:04
970,970," Seems like someone got screwed over lol, only $7500 wow, his voice was terrifying",11/15/2003 10:14
970,140," In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language. I wonder if James Earl Jones was involved with this.",4/6/2000 8:01
970,970," I dont think so at least not for the $7500 he got paid originally, do you have a favorite Star Wars movie?",10/16/2006 10:21
970,970," The second one, Empire. That one is my favorite. Then the first one.",12/19/1970 11:28
970,140," Mine was the Return of the Jedi, do you also like Transformers?",6/30/2018 22:37
970,140," I don't know them very well. Anyway, thanks for the chat! Have a good night!",11/3/1983 6:51
970,140, Hi - do you like Netflix?,3/28/1983 2:10
971,971, I do like Netflix but not as much as I use to. It doesn't seem like they have been adding new shows lately,8/5/1976 7:27
971,1667, I used to like it better also. I only use it because we get it for free with T Mobile.,1/3/1992 23:23
971,971, Are you a big fan of Star Wars?,9/6/1978 8:56
971,971, I'm not a huge fan. What about you?,12/30/2007 10:04
971,1667, No not really. I tried to watch a couple of the movies but I couldn't get into them like some people do.,10/9/2018 23:15
971,971, Did you know Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth usage in North America from 9pm-12am?,4/10/1976 2:17
971,1667, I didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me. I guess its pretty popular around the world.,8/18/2003 18:53
971,971, I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America.,11/11/2015 18:47
971,1667, I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer?,9/7/1973 10:24
971,1667, I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth,2/25/1989 17:26
972,972, I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome. Youtube is free and I can find lots more videos on random stuff.,1/22/2010 13:29
972,972, I agree. Netflix is worth $2 billion though so they must be doing something right.,11/11/2007 18:44
972,38, That is true. Do you like the movie Transformers?,6/3/1984 2:24
972,38," I have never seen it, but I like Megan Fox. She's easy on the eyes. What about you?",1/5/2011 5:25
972,972, I never watched it seemed to be pretty popular back in the day,3/31/2013 19:47
972,972," I think it was popular. In the 2007 film, there are 1.53 explosions per minute.",1/29/1980 12:01
972,972, Well it was distributed by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks. I think DreamWorks is the company that made Shrek.,12/12/2011 12:59
972,38, I think they are as well. I love DreamWorks films.,10/2/2012 10:05
972,972, I think they are a very good company also. Their animation keeps me pretty entertained.,9/15/1984 3:11
972,38, It was good talking to you.,11/11/2019 19:34
973,1351, Hi. Do you watch Netflix?,5/20/2020 13:45
973,1351, I do all the time.,4/27/2004 23:29
973,1351, Me too! They have so many subscribers that they take up around a third of all bandwidth used at night!,5/12/1992 23:50
973,1351," That's a lot, apparently they and youtube make up half of internet traffic during peek time in North America.",6/12/1988 6:15
973,973, That's incredible. I only started using them a few years ago but I think they've been around since 1997. ,7/28/1977 19:09
973,1351, I've been a loyal customer since then and they have come a long way from the B-movie streaming they use to do. ,7/13/1996 19:47
973,973," Yeah, they have a bunch of original series now!",4/28/2008 2:10
973,973, I know blockbuster has to be kicking themselves for not purchasing when they had the chance.,3/12/1972 14:34
973,1351, Definitely! They could have bought it for only $50 million. ,10/4/1983 8:11
973,973, Right and to think they are worth 2 billion. I just watch the avenger infinity war on there. im a big marvel fan. ,7/4/1989 10:35
974,176," I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies,was it good?",10/13/1981 8:04
974,176, Awesome!! you know hasting got the idea after he had to pay a large late fee. ,5/17/2018 13:15
974,974, I heard it was a $40 fee or so. I feel his pain. I did that a time or two myself back then. ,12/5/1991 15:07
974,176," Finally it got so bad i just had to find another store to rent from, haha! of the 137 million subscribers you mentioned, i believe that about 58 million are in the US.",9/6/2001 6:29
974,974," That's cool that they have a large international presence. They have offices in Japan and Brazil, too. ",7/12/2015 21:42
974,176, Yeah that's right and i think their first series was called Lilyhammer. an oxymoron if i ever heard one.,5/5/1971 8:40
974,176, True! I think that was made in 2012.,2/10/1990 14:25
974,974, Since then it's like they have a new show new movie every other week.,3/19/2018 1:51
974,176," It certainly seems that way. Some of them are really good, though! It's been nice talking to you, Have a great weekend!",5/6/1983 19:55
974,974," You too, thanks!",9/12/1980 2:14
975,627, Goodbye!,6/3/1973 9:01
975,627, did you know between 9pm -12 am netflix accounts for a third of the bandwidth in north america,3/16/2015 10:15
975,975, I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things.,4/15/1985 10:05
975,975, a guy racked up $40 in late fees on a vhs so he started netflix,3/19/1983 8:18
975,627, I remember the days of rentals. What a pain that was. Now we sit at home and just stream everything. I still like to get Netflix dvds cause I don't understand how to stream. My son laughs at me.,11/24/1984 17:53
975,627, well apparently netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth so maybe you aren't the only one!,5/10/1986 2:29
975,627," Yes, there's a lot of us old fogeys around. I liked them better before they changed their homepage. I find it very hard to find films anymore.Amazing that they are almost totally world-wide.",6/12/1970 13:29
975,627, I agree. I hate the new set up. I didnt realalize netflix started its own content in 2012. I thought it was much more recent than that,2/20/2004 12:59
975,627," Well at first I'm sure everyone thought that their self production shows would be like Japanese sci-fi films, not worth watching. but some of their shows are very highly rated.",12/15/2008 0:19
975,975, do you like star wars? james earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vaders lines and was paid $7500 i cant decide if that was a lot or a little in the 70s,10/2/1974 16:50
976,1203, It was low for voice actors then but he certainly made the character more evil than anyone else could have. That series has made so many people rich. Especially George Lucas.,12/25/2018 10:59
976,1203, in 2018 the total value for the star wars franchise was $65 BILLION. Thats insane,11/14/2019 22:10
976,976," Yes and that launched the career of many people, the most notable being Han Solo. The acting in the first was atrocious but got better as more movies were made. All told a great movie.",11/20/1974 5:43
976,976, I think its great that george lucas' wife marcia won an academy award for editing while george didn't win any for directing,6/20/1982 1:14
976,1203, He got his through notoriety. I think everyone knows his name. Some of the lingo has worked it's way into our language. Did you know that watching that movie was what made James Cameron go into directing?,10/14/1981 12:21
976,976, I did not know that. In the original transformers movie there are 1.53 explosions per minute lol. Michael Bay must love to blow things up,5/10/1990 4:46
976,1203," I think so! Special effects have become a huge part of action movies now, along with CGI of course. I guess the dept. of Defense has big ideas about transformers.",11/25/1970 4:34
976,1203, well those CGI effects took 38 hours to render one frame of movement,6/16/1971 3:15
976,976, I'm not a computer whiz but I have watched my son do his tricks as an IT expert and sometimes it takes him hours to resolve issues. I know that it would take me years to do one frame.,4/20/1976 20:56
976,976, I think the same is true for monster inc it took like a huge amount of hours just to make sullys arm move. I dont think I'd have the patience,3/16/2019 16:25
977,977, I hear that Bey's latest production Bumblebee is getting great reviews.,11/30/2017 4:36
977,977, I cna't believe there are still movies considering optimus prime has died 25 times in the last 30 years,2/26/1982 15:41
977,977, I haven't kept track but I'm going to remember that fact as a trivia question. I guess Bey actually appeared in one of the films by being a person who gets swatted away.,1/6/2010 5:12
977,659, thats interesting,11/14/1975 21:10
977,977," Hi, how are you?",3/21/2004 4:00
977,659, I'm good thanks. I was reading about tennis recently. Didier Drogba  is a soccer player that stopped a civil war in his home country. ,2/5/1982 11:06
977,659, I read the other day that they have used helicopters to dry off the fields for tennis,6/18/1996 5:51
977,659, Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating. ,8/14/2015 8:45
977,977, Really? I think they do that like every hit!,10/22/2008 0:48
977,977, The best players seem too. LOL!,4/10/1992 22:17
978,978," Maybe it gives them an advantage! I know a black man won in 1968, and none have won since, that is odd",1/3/1997 10:18
978,1848, Was that Rodney Wallace's father?,2/13/2008 13:02
978,1848, I am not sure to be honest... I have also heard a tennis player invented the polo!,12/22/1995 15:07
978,1848, That makes me curious about who invented table tennis.  Apparently Ping Pong is the name of the company that sells table tennis equipment. It's not the name of the game. I was surprised when I heard that.,8/4/1975 11:14
978,978, That is like the kleenex issue! Tennis is pretty much large scale ping pong!,3/10/1975 9:31
978,1848," Totally! Kleenex and Reynolds Wrap are brands that are so well known, their genre of products are known by the company name.  Kind of like Association Football is known just as football, even if it's not a part of the Association.",9/14/1975 19:58
978,1848, Apparently we call that soccer because it was slang for Association football!,7/16/1975 19:53
978,1848, Huh. I did not know that. I always wondered where the term soccer came from.,1/26/1984 15:03
978,978, there also is a version of soccer where 3 teams play at once!,10/6/1976 22:36
978,1848," Hmmm. If soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game, and they add a third team, I wonder, will that make them run closer to 10 miles?",2/7/1977 20:40
979,1703," most likely! that is a lot of running! a lot of people play though, over 250 million",10/3/2001 5:34
979,1703," It's amazing. All those people who play, but there are still some who shine.  Rodney Wallace, for example, made 101 international appearances over 14 years.",6/19/2016 6:24
979,1703, he represented his country well! that is a lot of games!,1/11/1973 11:23
979,1703," I agree. He was born Costa Rican, but he has become an American.",7/9/1987 1:10
979,979," that is a great thing for him, I am sure that was one of his dreams. hard work pays off!",11/14/1971 17:48
979,979," Hi, how are you?",9/10/1999 18:32
979,1703," Hi I'm good, did you know that only one black man has ever won the us open tennis tournament?",4/30/2013 1:46
979,979, Arthur Ash? I did not know that though. Thanks for sharing?,3/1/2008 20:25
979,1703," it might be, I'm not 100% sure, do you like tennis though? I do and I play actually",12/7/2000 18:17
979,979, I like it and used to play. I do not play any more though. how often do you play?,10/24/1996 18:38
980,980," I play in the summers we play a couple times a week, we play this game called pickleball a lot too its similar to tennis, did you hear that in 1969 they used helicopters to dry off the grass tennis courts, thats funny ",6/10/1970 1:07
980,1749, I had no idea. I am in parks and recreation and pickleball is a huge sport for us. At least compared to some other sports. ,1/11/2018 3:46
980,980, ah nice have you ever played? its more action packed and easier than tennis I think,1/31/2016 8:12
980,980, I have not but it does look fun. I am usually working when they are playing and would feel like too much of a slacker if I played instead of worked.,9/18/1984 11:54
980,1749," haha ya you have to work so thats fair, can you believe the longest tennis match ever lasted 11 hours spread over 3 days, I would be so tired",6/11/2004 4:37
980,1749," I think that was john isner, no?",4/3/1973 21:57
980,980," oh I'm not sure, I would hate to be the loser of that match though? It does seem like you know a lot about tennis players",8/15/2016 7:43
980,1749," I watch way too much sports. If it is a big moment in sports, I know about it. I wish I watched less tv though but I love sports so much.",11/12/1992 6:30
980,980," ya I agree, do you know the origin of the polo shirt? like who invented it and such?",5/26/1982 21:34
980,980, I do not. Was it Ralph Lauren?,9/24/2003 4:09
981,981," well it was created by a tennis player named Rene lacoste actually, and his nickname was the crocodile",5/16/1973 19:24
981,1320," I think I did know that, or at least now that you explain it to me it make sense. Lacoste is popluar attire for tennis.",2/27/1992 0:02
981,981," ya you're right, do you know any soccer facts? thats one sport I never watch haha",5/2/2019 23:35
981,981, European soccer is on before college football and the nfl so I watch it on saturday and sunday mornings. I also watch the MLS. I do not know a ton of trivia though. Do you?,11/13/2005 8:12
981,981," well I do know the city that will host the 2022 world cup doesn't exist yet, they have to build the whole city",9/6/2006 23:26
981,1320, Qatar. Im going to quit while I am ahead. Nice chatting with you!,3/7/1992 7:10
981,981, Hi there do you like association football?,5/9/2010 22:02
981,981, Hi there I actually do. Do you know why it is called soccer in the US?,7/2/1994 17:14
981,981, Yeah it is actually just a slang that stuck around,10/31/2021 8:13
981,981, Yeah pretty interesting. Jon Steward used to be a soccer player too,7/22/2021 18:56
982,982, Yeah he represented the US in the panamerican games in Brazil back in the day,11/29/1999 8:37
982,1459," Yeah pretty cool. It is a good sport to be in, they make more money than many other sports combined. ",12/24/1979 23:51
982,1459, Yeah it seems that way. Did you hear that German player donated his earnings from the World Cup?,4/25/1981 13:24
982,1459," Yeah he helped 23 little children in Brazil, what a human being",11/27/1976 5:18
982,1459, Yeah very heartwarming. Did you know there is a variation of soccer with 3 teams,7/1/1971 2:02
982,982, Wow that would be interesting to watch. Do they need three goals then?,9/10/1984 11:10
982,982, I am curious too. Do you know where the World Cup will take place in 2022?,1/20/2007 22:52
982,1459, I know that it is going to be in Qatar but I do not think they have the city ready for it yet,12/17/2011 0:31
982,1459, Yeah that is strange indeed. The US men's team got third place once in 1930,2/2/1978 0:05
982,1459, Yeah but after that it was all down. But the women's team is doing pretty well,7/3/1983 9:00
983,1426, Yes they have never placed below 3rd. so good for them,8/18/1992 16:22
983,983, Yeah they sure are good. THere are no economic gains though for the host countries,9/29/2004 23:00
983,983," And yet they bid to have it there, Hmm does not make much sense. Do you like tennis ?",2/5/1999 21:15
983,1426," I do , as much as I like polo shirts and we have tennis to thank for that",11/1/1988 22:40
983,1426," Yes that is true, Rene Lacoste to be more exact. Glad the other adopted the style too",4/1/2000 19:59
983,983, Yes very true. Do you know how long was the longest match?,1/20/2007 16:25
983,983, yes it lasted 11 hours and they had to stretch it over 3 days,8/14/1995 18:38
983,983, Hey! Did you watch FIFA World cup the last summer?,10/27/2016 8:31
983,983, Hey yeah I caught some of it. I love it because it is an international competition!,10/11/1984 22:18
983,1426, I'm wondering about 2022 in Qatar. They even didn't build city for the final. It's small country actually.,10/11/1973 2:59
984,791, Yeah they better get going. They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius!,2/2/1984 8:54
984,791," But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November. However, there is conflict with major championships. Anyway it would be fun. Do you watch tennis?",8/26/2013 14:11
984,791, Yeah I definitely enjoy watching tennis. Back in 1978 they could use anything for a racket-that would make it more interesting!,3/13/1974 4:27
984,984, Do you know that the longest match in history was 11 hours or about 3 days to play? It's incredible!!!,3/23/2014 12:22
984,791, Wow they must have been exhausted. Whereas the longest point was a 643 point rally lasting 29 minutes!,4/11/1992 10:37
984,984," I guess if in 2019 they make video how a helicopter is used to dry the glass tennis courts, it is going to be viral everywhere! haha",9/25/1971 5:30
984,984, Oh that is so cool I wanna look that up! Ping pong is like tennis but it isn't the sports name. The sport is actually called table tennis.,1/10/2002 21:41
984,791, do you play table tennis?,10/1/2006 3:13
984,984, Yes I do it's a fun sport. you? I think it's funny how some people consider grunting before a tennis shot to be cheating.,3/8/1995 7:32
984,791," True. I used to play a lot in my school years, but just don't remember when I played the last time. I didn't kniw that Lacoste was invented for tennis players. I was always sure for polo players, but they just adopted it.",9/2/2012 0:25
985,1117," Yeah same. I never knew the tennis ball was covered with felt, I thought it was a different type of material.",6/9/1971 20:29
985,1117," I've read something about it. Anyway despite all, soccer makes much more money that football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined. I'm not surprised. ",3/23/1972 15:57
985,1117, Yeah it is such a global sport! On average soccer players run 7 miles per game. No wonder they are in such great shape.,1/30/1976 5:04
985,1117," Yes, it's quite average for 90 min game. I honestly say football, not soccer, because I more interested in this sport and all people in the world call it football. It was slang in US and this is why we call it this way.",11/10/1975 18:33
985,985, Interesting. Yea I always wondered that. Oddly enough Greenland can't join Fifa because not enough grass grows there. ,10/21/1986 2:06
985,1117, haha. It's nice. They are part of Denmark actually. Do they have enough men for 1 team? haha,11/23/2016 15:31
985,985, Good question! What's even crazier is the superbowl is smaller than soccers (or football for you) 3rd biggest event. ,4/15/2007 11:29
985,1117," Yes, I can believe in it. It was nice to chat with you. Have a great day!",5/13/2009 10:02
985,1117, You too! Have fun watching the next world cup in qatar! ,10/4/2013 16:10
985,985, Did you watch the Pacific Rim Uprising movie?,6/9/2016 0:43
986,986," Hello there, no I have not see it, is it any good?",7/11/2021 18:40
986,986," I did, I thought it was pretty good, the first movie was better though, had more action",9/16/2002 18:06
986,533, I will have to check it out sometime then if I get a chance.   Are you a big user of Netflix?,8/12/1985 13:40
986,533," I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you?",5/9/2006 0:36
986,986, No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol. ,11/25/1974 8:18
986,533," I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic",8/3/1979 23:15
986,533," Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me. ",2/10/2012 2:11
986,533," It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe",1/2/1992 16:25
986,986," And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content. ",6/25/1997 21:32
986,533," I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay",2/2/1972 8:59
987,1243," Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes. ",5/8/1989 19:53
987,987," Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise?",2/25/1974 13:02
987,1243," Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you?",2/7/2004 5:15
987,1243," I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though, ",5/21/2001 8:59
987,1243," Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well!",4/12/2010 21:43
987,987," Yeah I agree with you, its amazing how much the franchise is worth though, 65 billion dollars!!",1/2/2016 21:18
987,987, Yeah that is an insane amount.  I wonder how much it was worth back in the 1990's?,6/30/1987 9:52
987,1243," I bet not much, at least at the beggining 20th Century Fox didnt have much faith in the movie, that lack of faith cost them millions",1/20/1980 19:40
987,1243," Yeah they dropped the ball, Disney sure spent a bunch but i'm sure it will all pay off in the long run. ",3/3/2019 9:48
987,1243," They need to improve the movies, have more jedis in them, do you like Transformers?",6/16/1986 13:13
988,988," Yeah I agree with that for sure.  No, I have only seen about 5 mins of one of the films.  How about you?",4/13/1984 6:42
988,988," I like the series, I thought the first movie back in 2007 was the best one though and didt like the The Last Knigh premiered in 2017",6/19/1976 20:31
988,988,  I will have to check that one out sometime then.  Well it was nice talking with you today. ,12/9/1972 8:23
988,988, Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kardashians? ,4/6/1975 13:33
988,298," Yes, I know bits and pieces. I know Kim was born 10-21-80. ",9/28/2011 17:19
988,988," Yeah, it's basically just her and her family doing everyday life things. Did you know she named her baby Chicago?",10/7/1977 21:38
988,988, I did know. It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well. ,1/7/1986 8:14
988,988, That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant? ,6/15/1977 10:24
988,298, I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular.,5/28/1977 19:07
988,298, That,7/18/1991 15:36
989,989, I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014.,7/14/1994 16:37
989,928," Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song?",9/23/1974 2:27
989,928, I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians.,3/30/2018 22:07
989,989," Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose. ",7/7/2002 4:59
989,928, Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people.,10/17/1978 21:31
989,928, She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.  ,3/5/1972 14:49
989,989," I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement.",6/3/2012 12:31
989,928," Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?",10/16/1993 4:36
989,989," Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability q score? I know Tom Hanks rates a 48, while Kim's is a -71, which is hilarious.",6/7/1994 13:07
989,989," I've never heard of a q-score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of the Kardashians are probably not good in relations to likability. ",6/24/2003 14:28
990,990, I would have to agree. I know critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.,9/27/1974 20:49
990,1010," Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talents. Just being wealthy and now famous. They are always coming up with new ways to stay in the spotlight.",3/14/1993 20:15
990,990," Yes, I agree. Although she is reported to be the highest-paid reality personality of 2015 with her total earnings exceeding $53 million.",11/13/1987 19:54
990,990," Yeah, I guess I would do some silly stuff like that if I was making that much money off of it. It was nice chatting with you!",12/25/2011 10:16
990,1010, Have you seen the movie Solaris?,3/11/2021 4:15
990,990, No.  Do you know anything more about it?,4/1/1984 14:07
990,1010," I just think the theme is fascinating ... the tension arising from floating around a planet, but never landing.  Have you felt that way in life?",7/20/1976 7:36
990,1010, No.  I did learn lately that our planet is also called Gaia.,1/22/1990 13:19
990,1010," Oh, I mean, where you're constantly in flux and you see everyone else with concrete life happening and making progress ... and you're not.",9/5/2003 0:52
990,990, I read about a planet that orbits 4 stars.  Perhaps that would parallel the concept you are discussing.  The direction would be hard to determine.,2/24/1983 22:09
991,991," Interesting.  I've heard of dual-stars, but this is four?  Normally planets just have the one star, so that would be extraordinary.",1/15/1984 13:30
991,1675, Clearly the universe is amazing.  Early humans could study it some since 5 planets are visible to the naked eye.,2/22/1972 6:08
991,1675," I don't think I could tell the difference between them.  But just imagine having the time and attention to discern that there are five different ones, all without photography!",8/23/2007 6:30
991,991," No doubt!  Previous generations were intelligent too.  As long ago as 1975, the Soviets sent a spacecraft to Venus and mankind saw pictures of the surface.",7/23/2015 5:00
991,1675," I'd say they were smarter.  I think the current generation only feels smart because we've got all this technology and knowledge at our fingertips.  So then, we feel like we can fill all our time with comedy.",11/16/2003 1:35
991,991, Great point.  They created wealth that allows free time in our lifetime.  Evan Almighty was a comedy that had a budget of $200 million.,6/11/1976 12:36
991,1675, And what else could be done with $200 million?  Probably something much more important.,4/24/2022 18:56
991,1675," I think that it is neat that it can be done.  The $200 million did not disappear.  Cameramen, actors and many others received income from it. It is not as respected as some other genres.  It has been 37 years since a comedy won Best Picture.",1/30/2018 17:20
991,991," True.  What film was that?  For as popular as comedies are, you'd think it would not have been so long.",12/28/2016 20:49
991,991," I don't know the film.  However, The Empire Strikes back was nominated for best comedy in 1981 by the Writers Guild.  That is strange.",5/13/2019 1:45
992,1900," Calling something a comedy when it's not really makes you think about it ... have we all been viewing it wrongly?  Such organizations sometimes get it wrong, like when 3rd Rock from the Sun won for best comedy series over Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier in 1997.",9/2/2010 20:36
992,992, What do you call 3rd Rock?  Satire is comedy also.,9/2/1986 0:52
992,1900," I'd call it comedy, satirical for sure, but just not better than Seinfeld.",7/2/2004 18:12
992,1900, Oh!  I agree with you on that.  Awards have a political factor in decision making.  I saw that Drew Carey did stand up in the Marines for 8 years before he started making money from comedy.,1/25/1973 9:50
992,1900, Sometimes it takes while to get it right and then cash in.  I'm glad some networks like Comedy Central take risks and then cancel shows if they flop.  They've cancelled over 100 shows in the past three decades.,5/11/1985 22:35
992,992, Wow. That is a lot of shows to cancel.  We have so many channels now that most shows that are good can find an audience.  ,3/4/1977 12:24
992,992," And enough people willing to explore them all until they find them.  If you asked me to watch tv from another country to find something I like, it would take me weeks.  Americans seem to just put in that effort on a regular basis.",3/30/1980 5:51
992,992, Well.  I think I will go now.  Enjoyed the talk!,8/19/2005 18:28
992,1900, What's up? Are you into pop music? It originated during the mid-1950s,3/28/1980 0:11
992,992, yes very much so.,7/2/1978 2:29
993,661, Until the 1960s rock and pop were considered the same,5/28/2020 9:49
993,661, right ! and do you know that korea has its own k-pop band which is the most popular musical group in the country,9/22/2012 4:55
993,993," Yea, Moranbong band I believe ",6/17/1990 0:48
993,993, yes thats right. and another cool fact is that the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office ?,2/19/2001 16:49
993,993," Lol that's nuts. I didn't know Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s, it's hard to imagine",5/15/1973 18:56
993,661, i know ! i never would have thought that either!,1/19/1988 10:02
993,993," Apparently scientist voted We are the Champions as the catchiest pop song, I wonder how they came up with that",12/5/1981 10:56
993,661," im not sure , but they are probably right.",10/13/1979 0:14
993,661, I guess they concluded that pop has grown louder and increasingly musically homogeneous since the mid-1960s,4/9/2022 11:59
993,993, yes and in  2002 CREED ocncert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band! wow !,3/31/2017 20:02
994,1307," I don't blame them, I don't much like Creed myself.",8/21/1971 14:24
994,1307," yes they are !, it was great talking to you about music, i loved it , thank you ",7/19/1994 17:44
994,1307," No problem. Did you know the Ramones played 2,263 concerts? That's wild",10/17/1983 0:34
994,994, yes thats pretty wild!,11/5/2014 1:44
994,994, Apparently they toured non-stop for 20 years,5/23/2015 11:29
994,994, cool! and did you know that when eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for Beat it  that he literally set the speakers on fire,2/2/2013 6:34
994,1307," Lol, no but that's awesome. Pink Floyd recorded a live concert with no audience",2/11/2011 7:11
994,994, wonder if they were just practicing ?,6/24/2003 17:17
994,994," I don't think so, they did it in the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii.",5/6/1972 3:09
994,994," thats really interesting , thank you for the conversation. good bye",12/20/1988 23:57
995,995, See ya,4/9/2011 13:24
995,95, good bye,8/19/1998 10:11
995,95, peace,5/6/2010 4:02
995,995, Hello how are you today?,11/18/2006 13:52
995,995," Hello, I am good. How are you?  Do you listen to jazz music?",12/8/2001 1:07
995,95, I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century.,6/28/1992 23:08
995,95, i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something?,6/16/1983 21:37
995,995, It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression.,12/9/1979 12:35
995,995, I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra!,11/23/2009 17:46
995,995, Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz.,1/28/1999 3:42
996,340, i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s.,10/21/2014 4:57
996,340, Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast.,4/6/1986 17:48
996,340, No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection.,9/16/1982 21:07
996,996, Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie.,4/27/1991 6:46
996,996, He did?  What instrument does he play?,6/19/2021 5:14
996,996, I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years.,4/20/2018 5:32
996,996, That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long.,1/22/1996 1:29
996,340, She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out.,4/4/1989 1:25
996,996, You never know.  He's a top performer if he can do a movie score.  ,1/13/2002 6:17
996,340, I just figured it would be something that would interest him. Did you know jazz trumpeters grow out their goatees because it provides comfort while playing their instrument.,1/29/1981 14:14
997,997, No lol! I just assumed it was for fashion.,1/4/1998 6:50
997,997, So what do you think about Judge Judy making 123000 dollars per episode. I heard she retired not to long ago.,10/16/1999 22:22
997,997," That surprises me. I mean, i'm shocked she made so much money and that she retired.",6/5/1984 7:47
997,1853, She was the highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James. I cant believe she made that much.,4/20/2010 16:39
997,997," I can't either.  I knew her show was popular but not that popular!  Well, I've got to go for now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",8/29/1985 12:15
997,997, Hey did you know that Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics? thats crazy,10/30/1989 23:17
997,997," Wow.  That's cool.  Much cooler than,  say, playing the accordion... ",8/1/1992 19:39
997,1853," Do you play any instruments? I gave up videogames and started playing the piano a couple years ago, and I haven't looked back since haha",3/21/1984 8:56
997,1853," No, unless you count an mp3 player.  I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music.",8/31/1978 4:49
997,997," No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha",7/29/1974 10:03
998,998," Wow, they must have been really buzzed.  I don't know if Creed is considered pop but I mostly like alternative and stuff off the beaten path.  You?",6/19/2019 0:57
998,1928," I really like classic rock and 80's, I can listen to almost anything except country, I do like pink floyd a lot and that's awesome they did a live concert to no audience haha",9/5/2001 9:04
998,1928, I do like 80s stuff like REM and the B52s... I even go back further once in a while and listed to Pink Floyd as recorded on a floating recording studio.  ,6/23/2003 10:33
998,998," ha I would love to do that, I do like Queen, I didn't know their guitarist uses coins as guitar picks, did you see the new movie that came out about Queen?",11/1/2017 14:27
998,998, Loved Freddie and his band... I haven't seen the movie yet but want to... Did ya know that scientists declared We Are the Champions the catchiest pop song of all time.  Scientists?,4/16/2010 1:09
998,998," haha like how do you measure that? It is catchy but I would think it would be another song, ti's scary that lincoln park has done 324 concerts in 2001, that's almost 1 per day that sounds exhausting",3/19/2004 6:45
998,998, Yep.  That's crazy.  They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters. ,3/18/2010 19:51
998,1928," Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least",3/1/2013 21:46
998,1928, No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.  While I'm not big on pop at least it's mostly upbeat albeit mind numbing... ,3/7/2005 22:29
998,998," ya it is, pop music is good in small quantities for me, I like more complex stuff but pop music is good to pass the time and for parties",2/26/1989 11:38
999,999," Yeah… I prefer guitars and amped up stuff to most R&B, rap and hip-hop.",4/5/1992 16:26
999,999," I can't believe that the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts so far that is a massive number.",3/3/1997 1:48
999,999," Yeah, makes ya wanna get sedated huh?  That's cool... Can't believe Eddie Van Halen set speakers on fire... Something tells me there's more to it that his playing like maybe he had it turned up to 11",5/16/1987 4:55
999,999," Ya see that is awesome, I can't believe teh president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums, I want to see trump release an album just to hear what that would sound like haha",8/5/1977 4:17
999,999, Something tells me that Trump singing may be accompanied by an accordian.,1/24/1973 3:32
999,999," haha ya I wonder what instrument he would play, did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's?",6/28/1992 23:36
999,153," No, don't even know who he is? I thought it was weird that the CIA sponsored a music event (Coupe Mondiale).",4/11/1978 8:15
999,999, That is wild.,10/26/2016 1:26
999,999," Hello,  do you know much about cinematography?",2/28/2017 6:13
999,153," Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards.",9/28/2001 0:40
1000,1000," Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times. ",8/4/2010 12:15
1000,485, Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week. ,11/15/1982 21:53
1000,485, I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography?,7/11/2013 11:42
1000,1000, That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus. ,7/9/1986 19:04
1000,485, Me either.  do you like comedy?,10/22/1987 20:41
1000,485, Yes.  I can't believe the Green Lantern was going to be a comedy with Jack Black!,4/29/1995 2:29
1000,1000, Yeah thats weird!  Not sure it woldve made it better though lol ,2/6/1984 3:39
1000,1000," Couldn't have hurt much. :) I was surprised to know that the Python programming language was, in part, named after Monty Python. ",3/5/1995 13:06
1000,485," Yeah thought that might have been a coincidence.  I guess comedy central has not been doing great,  It has cancelled over  shows!",9/23/2007 16:24
1000,485, That or they're picky.  Bill Murray isn't so picky.  He thought the Kung Fu Hustle was super great. ,7/31/1981 22:49
1001,187, It was a great movie!  ,8/1/2010 20:08
1001,1001, I am an amatuer astonomer and Jupiter's moon Ganymede fascinates me since it is big enough to be a planet.,9/29/2008 21:57
1001,187, That is really big! ,1/30/2021 1:13
1001,187, Another one is that Uranus is actually rotating on its side.  Many think it was involved in a major collision. ,12/20/2017 10:11
1001,1001," Oh thats interesting.  and the accident threw it off axis?  If it rotates on its side,  does that mean there is an area that doesnt get any sun?",7/23/2002 16:56
1001,1001," Yeah, the sunlight is in weird time patterns on the poles. I guess the building blocks of life (e.g., RNA) have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away. ",2/3/1970 7:42
1001,187, Do you know what planet it is where shards of glass rain sideways in 2000 degress fahrenheit?,11/8/1998 0:19
1001,187, I would guess one of the outer ice planets - probably Neptune.  Venus doesn't have seasons or that kind of wind. ,3/28/1989 23:12
1001,1001," interesting,  thanks.  ",5/13/1995 20:11
1001,1001, Thank you.  You were a great chat partner. ,5/6/1991 10:59
1002,1002," Hey, how's it going? Are you a fan of Phil Collins at all?",1/12/2014 13:12
1002,1002," Yea Phil Collins is a pretty good singer, I never knew he was in the beatles movie A Hard Day's Night",10/30/2016 6:22
1002,1367," Yeah I liked Genesis in particular, back when he was paired up with Peter Gabriel. Though they've both had solid solo careers.",10/26/1989 7:59
1002,1002," Yea, it's crazy Collins sold 100 million in Genesis and as a solo act",12/16/1984 4:11
1002,1367, Do you have a favorite song from Phil Collins or Genesis?,12/4/1997 10:54
1002,1002, I really like the 1984 hit Against All Odds,11/19/1999 23:06
1002,1002, I'm a big fan of Invisible Touch. That was after Peter Gabriel left and it more just Phil Collins leading the way. Right before he went solo.,8/22/1987 15:44
1002,1367," Yea, In the Air Tonight is also a great song, it's cool that Collins 17 year son gets to play concerts with his dad",3/17/2001 4:19
1002,1002, Are you more a fan of pop or rock music?,6/30/1975 3:37
1002,1367, Probably Rock music but they were basically the same thing until the late 1960s,12/11/2003 1:14
1003,1003, Did you know Rick Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I can't picture it lol,1/6/2001 8:11
1003,1003," No, that's pretty funny. In Japan they have 100 % cgi pop stars",2/6/2010 9:36
1003,1003, Pop music is huge in Asia. Especially k-pop. I think there's a boy band from Korea even going around in the US now,2/5/2001 0:06
1003,856, I wonder if their songs use the same 4 chords as most pop hits in the US,6/28/1981 10:36
1003,1003, I bet it does. Do you remember that band Creed? Man they were awful.,7/24/1998 5:18
1003,856," Yea they were, they sounded much worse than the 4 chords always used in pop songs",2/22/2000 21:59
1003,1003, Apparently once they were so bad that four of the people that attended a concert sued them for being bad.,7/4/1980 20:34
1003,1003, Lol that's pretty funny. Did you know Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert?,4/10/2012 18:25
1003,856," Nope, that's pretty cool! Loved that song Smoke on the Water.",6/3/1975 7:33
1003,1003, Yea it's a great song. It's weird Abba turned down 1 billion dollars to do a reunion tour,6/2/1999 7:52
1004,107, That is weird. It was nice chatting with you!,10/9/2006 15:24
1004,107, Are you a fan of pop music?,3/19/2004 1:19
1004,1004, i do like pop music. You?,9/27/1979 1:06
1004,107," I love it, it became popular in the states around the 60s right?",8/13/1978 23:04
1004,107, i guess? i dont know what the definition of pop music is. i figure there must have been stuff in the 50s too.,7/9/1977 20:25
1004,107, Do you have a favorite pop artist?,2/13/2020 5:20
1004,107," i dont, but recently i was listening to xtc. they did an album called oranges and lemons.",2/4/1974 10:50
1004,107, He did? one of my favorites is Rikey Gerwais he used to be a big deal back in the 80s,6/14/2000 17:59
1004,1004, i did not know that he did pop music. i thought he was a comedian.,6/10/2007 15:00
1004,1004," He was a pop singer in the 80s really talented in fact, pop music has grown a lot louder since the 60s",8/30/2017 15:11
1005,1324, it sure has. the amplification systems have improved substantially.,4/3/1972 12:28
1005,1005," It has, my favorite pop song is We Are the Champions and its actually voted as the catchiest song by a group of scientists",1/23/2002 0:44
1005,1005," yeah, have you seen the movie about queen? that song shows up. it sure is catchy.",2/25/1978 19:09
1005,1324," I did watch that movie, thought it was really cool, liked it  alot",8/16/1992 10:24
1005,1324, it was a fun film. Rami won an oscar for his performance. i wish i had seen queen in concert.,8/28/1978 23:05
1005,1324," I think Remi diserved it, he nailed the role and I wish that too, have you been to any great concerts lately?",8/15/1973 13:16
1005,1324, no i have not. no money for it. i used to go quite frequently when i was younger.,7/22/2011 11:00
1005,1005, Did you ever go to a Ramones concert?,7/21/2009 21:37
1005,1324, i wish i had. those guys were always touring. i missed my chance.,3/15/2006 12:05
1005,1324," I missed mine too and also the chance to watch Linkin Park live, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 alone",7/27/2010 17:00
1006,1006," those kids were great! that is an insane effort on their part. i wish i had seen them. too. Anyway, great chat!",6/22/1972 14:19
1006,1006," Really hard, 1 concert per day, the toll it must have taken on them and I agree its been a great chat, thanks a lot. ",4/15/1990 0:26
1006,1006, I am not a super Phil Collins fan-are you?,5/24/2011 10:24
1006,1006," Hello there, I am not but he does have a few good songs. ",1/23/1993 5:53
1006,1006, He has done a lot of stuff. I am more of a Mick Jagger person. I think the era of mega stars like that is over. Too bad.,12/16/1999 22:55
1006,1006," Yeah Mick was awesome, the Stones had so many great hits over the years.  I can't believe they still tour!  That is impressive!",2/10/2009 19:44
1006,1006, He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel.,4/28/2021 5:37
1006,1006," Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days?",4/20/1975 22:09
1006,1293, Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close.,2/22/2002 12:16
1006,1006," That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.  ",12/5/2018 8:50
1007,522, I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins.,9/5/1997 7:14
1007,1007," Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band!",1/24/1991 14:32
1007,522, It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free.,7/15/2011 7:37
1007,522," Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live. ",3/17/1986 22:01
1007,1007, I like Pink Floyd! I don't see that We are the Champions is the catchiest tune ever. That makes no sense.,11/2/2020 20:41
1007,522, Good call! Yeah I don't agree with that at all.  There are plenty more catchy tunes from the 50's and 60's I would say. ,4/10/1972 12:59
1007,522, I would have liked to see Pink Floyd in a Roman Amphitheater. I bet the sound was really good.,11/22/1991 18:55
1007,1007," Yeah that would have been cool, so many concerts over the years that would have been amazing to attend. ",12/24/1978 2:11
1007,1007, I used to like the music really loud but I saw Led Zeppelin (after they got to be famous) at the Boston Garden and it was too loud. Ever one lit little candles-you couldn't do that now. The Fire Marshall would have a heart attack. lol,4/1/1990 20:19
1007,522," Yeah imagine them trying to do things like that now, no way!  So, be glad you got to experience it like that I would say. ",5/28/2002 15:13
1008,1008, Everyone was friendly and there was no trouble. Can you imagine?,5/21/2016 20:55
1008,1636," Yeah exactly, now days there are always people to ruin everything, and it can't just be fun and simple anymore. ",8/5/1983 4:36
1008,1008, You are right. Sad but true. Nice talking to you. ,5/21/1995 7:55
1008,1636," Yeah same here, hope you have a good day. ",3/27/2001 17:34
1008,1008, Hi There! Do you like movies?,10/28/2001 18:40
1008,1008," I like movies, it is a form of art. . ",8/15/2005 10:52
1008,1008," This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself. ",11/6/2008 18:14
1008,1008," You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ? ",6/3/1971 13:22
1008,1636," It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick.",6/24/1982 15:49
1008,1008," Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it. ",1/3/1986 17:14
1009,1009, Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography.,4/21/1994 20:47
1009,1018, I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist. ,10/1/2008 16:41
1009,1009, That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated.,11/4/2019 2:20
1009,1009," Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ?",4/30/1996 11:57
1009,1018," I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.",2/8/2020 0:34
1009,1018," He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film. ",6/12/2018 3:05
1009,1018, I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy.,11/1/2013 0:32
1009,1018," I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ?",5/29/2003 7:41
1009,1009," no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black",10/18/2022 8:12
1009,1018," That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick. ",4/23/2007 7:21
1010,1341," Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun? ",4/1/1986 18:24
1010,1010," I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld. ",11/13/2002 18:11
1010,1341," 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier.",2/1/2019 15:20
1010,1341," That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever. ",3/3/1986 23:22
1010,1010, True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989,8/31/2000 20:32
1010,1010, You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes. Comedy central would have been bankrupt if they continued to produce those 100 unfunny shows. ,3/30/1991 2:06
1010,1341," True, I learned this the other day..The creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor british comedy group monty python",2/12/1984 13:06
1010,1010," Do you like Monty Python ? I like absurd comedy, so I like them.",1/20/1990 7:15
1010,1010," Not really, I never really understood it.",3/31/1983 18:52
1010,1010, Don't worry I don't think I would find funny an ancient greek comedy. Everyone has his own tastes.,11/25/1994 1:41
1011,1011, Very true. Do you know anything about plantes?,7/9/1997 1:27
1011,1011, I don't know I know we live on Earth. have a good day. ,7/19/2012 9:42
1011,1985, you too!,8/7/2005 15:24
1011,1011, Do you enjoy music?,2/25/1979 13:41
1011,1985, Yes. I love Jazz music but I also have a love for Kanye West songs.,10/27/1975 7:09
1011,1011," Jazz is amazing. I love how it maintained its core essence, yet amalgamated with local musical culture to generate countless distinct styles",5/21/2013 11:15
1011,1985," Yes. I listen to it every night when I eat dinner. I have really gotten into Modal jazz. Most people like Jazz-rock, but I'm more of a 1950's guy.",11/15/1997 20:08
1011,1011," I think all you mentioned are great, but personally I enjoy how cool jazz has developed",3/23/1974 21:35
1011,1011, Are there any particular cool jazz groups you like?,11/4/1997 22:22
1011,1011," Not in particular, but I do enjoy the calmer smoother sounds and linear melodic lines. Looking at jazz overall, my favorite probably would be frank sinatra",5/8/1978 16:25
1012,531, Kanye West often compares himself as the modern day Frank Sinatra.,2/2/1992 1:24
1012,531," I will admit both made their mark on music, but I like Sinatra more",4/5/2003 8:33
1012,531," Do you see yourself jealous of Kanye's success? I sometimes do. He has Kim Kardashian, hot and a money maker.",6/16/1975 8:53
1012,1012," Well I won't deny I would desire money and success, however, their lives of living under the microscope and being stalked by paparazzi sounds too stressful",10/4/1972 7:19
1012,531, Even if you get all the tea's in the world? I guess it's bad for their children who have to be subjected to the awful names and filmed. I can't believe they named their child Chicago.,6/8/1992 18:12
1012,531, I don't think that is too bad. I know a family whose last name is trout so the father named his sons red and brown,11/26/1993 2:43
1012,1012," Were their English limited or do they have some psychological problems...? Do they not understand the damage they can cause the children? These odd baby names, although originated from somewhere is really bad for the kids.",3/10/1985 8:24
1012,1012," They said that it was terrible when young, but very helpful when they became adults since everyone remembered them positively. I think it's better than hashtag",9/19/1995 23:47
1012,531, I guess so. The kid can build character based on these names/nick names.,3/2/1971 13:33
1012,531, There are also a lot of people trying to name their children after celebrities or characters in films like rocky ,11/17/2018 21:06
1013,667," I wish i had Celebrity income. Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode.",5/27/1978 5:07
1013,667, True. I mean Kim Kardashian had earnings of 53 million to date,8/14/2014 1:59
1013,1013," I would also get special access, did you know pixar studio has a secret room visited often by celebrities?",2/26/1990 2:51
1013,1013," That's cool I wonder what is inside. In any case, thank you for the amazing chat.",12/23/2005 20:44
1013,667, I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that!,1/1/2001 2:38
1013,1013, Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also.,12/29/1986 21:20
1013,667," I've actually never seen it, whats it about? ",7/21/2001 9:44
1013,667, It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too.,10/28/2015 4:06
1013,1013," i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy",8/12/2015 9:42
1013,1013, Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes,7/27/1973 17:00
1014,1014," I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock. Seinfeld was revolutionary, are you more of a Seinfeld or Friends fan?",9/3/1996 13:59
1014,603, Seinfeld by far. Friends doesn't hold up very well for me. I wonder if it would have been one of the 100 shows Comedy Central cancelled over the years if it had been on that channel. You? Friends or Seinfeld?,4/26/1985 15:26
1014,1014, perhaps! I'm actually more of a Friends fan myself lol. It's interesting how much tv shows and movies have changed over the years. Even just through more advanced filming abilities and styles. Shout out to James Wong for pioneering the use of wide-angle lenses amongst other things,6/25/2008 14:56
1014,1014, He was quite the pioneer despite the racism.,4/13/1985 12:01
1014,603," he had a lot to overcome and still won an Oscar. I've read in other articles that the Oscars are pretty racist too, not recognizing talented individuals due to their race. ",12/21/1991 23:53
1014,1014," There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated.",7/31/2008 12:20
1014,603, that's some crazy stuff. It even must be frustrating with Roger Daekins for being nominated 13 times and never having won,1/20/2001 18:32
1014,1014, And the guy who was supposed to be the cinematographer for Spartacus didn't actually do the work and won the academy award.,8/18/1990 9:16
1014,1014, I'd be pretty angry if that happened to me lol. Have you heard of Gavin Free before reading about him?,11/20/1991 14:57
1014,603, Yeah he did slo-mo cinematography on Hot Fuzz.,6/9/1998 5:53
1015,1965," interesting, Hot Fuzz was a good movie. I thoroughly enjoy comedies",10/19/2018 20:30
1015,1015, Yeah it was. Comedy is a great art form. It all started back in ancient Athens.,3/2/2018 5:59
1015,1015, Its interesting how the change of definition of planet meant that Pluto was no longer a planet. ,9/18/1991 16:16
1015,1965, I'm still bitter about that. I never want to visit the one that rains shards of glass at 4500mph.,10/7/1994 0:51
1015,1965, thats such an unusual characteristic of a planet. Sounds like complete chaos there lol AND it's 2000 degrees farenheit. insane.,4/13/1993 2:54
1015,1015, Maybe we'll make it to Ganymede someday. It's a Jupiter moon big enough to be a planet.  Cya!,7/21/2010 2:14
1015,1015, thanks for the conversation!,9/24/1984 21:28
1015,1965, Sure!,4/26/2002 15:51
1015,1015, bye!,10/5/1994 10:11
1015,1015, Do you happen to enjoy pop music?,1/11/2017 2:29
1016,1016," I do, I like Queen myself. Did you know that it's been scientifically proven that We Are The Champions is the catchiest pop song of all time?",2/12/2008 21:03
1016,1016, I did not but I love Queen. Are you familiar with K-pop?,10/30/2006 7:33
1016,1016, I'm kind of familiar with it.,6/1/1999 11:03
1016,1016, Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music. ,10/31/2003 22:04
1016,1016, I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with Dear loser. That's kind of disheartening.,7/15/1975 15:26
1016,1908, Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that. ,3/8/2013 9:24
1016,1016, I've heard that and I can't believe it. I'm glad he stuck with comedy instead of that.,5/21/1970 1:50
1016,1908, Me too. Do you like to attend concerts?,6/23/1989 5:04
1016,1016," I do, I'm actually attending one next weekend. I wish I could have been at the Foo Fighters concert that was so loud it showed up on New Zealand's seismic monitors!",8/12/1999 0:13
1016,1016, I didn't know that happened. I do love the Foo Fighters though. Did you know that in 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts because their album was so successful?,1/27/2019 23:58
1017,124," Oh wow, that's alot of concerts. That album is one of my favorites. Have you heard about Deep Purple breaking the record for the loudest concert in 1972? Three audience members were rendered unconscious!",9/7/1973 13:57
1017,1017," I did not. That seems excessive to me. I'm surprised Deep Purple would be the ones to play a concert that loud. Did you know that The Ramones played 2,263 concerts over the span of their career?",10/22/1988 6:46
1017,1017, That's a lot of concerts! Wow. Did you know that Abba turned down $1 BILLION to do a 100 concert reunion tour?,11/4/1974 0:24
1017,124, I did not. Wow! They must still have a lot of money saved to be able to turn that down. I don't like to laugh at the misfortune of others but I find it amusing that concert attendees filed a lawsuit against Creed because their concert was so bad. ,2/25/1989 14:00
1017,1017, That is pretty funny. It must have been towards then end of Creed. ,10/14/1974 12:28
1017,124, I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that?,5/20/2019 11:33
1017,1017," Oh wow, that's kind of odd. I heard that in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. I'm sure they enjoyed it. ",11/16/2002 18:26
1017,1017, Lou Reed is a weird guy so I'm not that surprised. There is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is used as a concert venue. I bet that would be amazing. ,1/6/2007 12:01
1017,124, That would be an amazing experience seeing a band playing there.,4/23/1988 1:47
1017,124, It would leave you with a story to tell for sure. I would take so many pictures. ,4/9/2003 23:45
1018,560," Hello,  do you know much about celebrities?",10/13/1981 6:43
1018,560, Yes I do. What about you?,2/6/1987 19:06
1018,560, No I dont know much lol there are too many celebrities.,8/8/1985 8:45
1018,1018," Yep, I know about the Kardashian family and Kanye. They are always up to something. ",10/14/1971 3:02
1018,560, Did you know that Pixar studios has a secret room for only celebrities?,6/27/1981 3:18
1018,560, No I did not know that until I read these articles. The favors celebrities get bothers me. ,3/26/2009 5:53
1018,560," Yeah seriously,  kinda ridiculous.  Also,  how much they get paid,  I feel like actors and actresses dont even do the hardest work,  all the editing and music and stuff seems like way more work lol",3/7/1989 7:01
1018,1018," I agree, Kim Kardashian earned $53 million in 2015, Judge Judy earns $123,000 per tv episode!! just mind blowing. There are people out there going to bed without food. ",11/23/2005 11:08
1018,1018, I really dislike that whole Kardashian family. I think  it is ridiculous how much money they make and they dont really seem to earn it.  I think I saw one episode where the younger one wants to buy a house and doesn't even know what credit is. ,4/24/1976 8:23
1018,560," lol, they are socialites and the media has elevated them. Just revealing their 3 rd child's name - Chicago blew up social media. ",7/15/1984 5:53
1019,888," Yeah it's crazy,  and all their businesses are completely run by other people. They act like they are so stressed all the time. ",1/17/2012 3:05
1019,1019, How about a Harlem woman who has held a Jazz concert in her apartment every Sunday for 20 years!!! crazy,9/18/2022 20:12
1019,1019, Thats pretty awesome.  Im sure the clean up is pretty bad to have to clean your apartment every sunday lol,7/13/2020 22:48
1019,1019, Yep! and top performers occassionally stop by. ,9/19/2021 20:02
1019,1019," That  nice,  do you like jazz?  who is your favorite artist?",1/15/1973 20:56
1019,1019, I really don't care for it. Tony Bennett impresses me.,12/20/1988 11:46
1019,1019, Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provides comfort. ,8/17/1994 3:37
1019,1019, lol. What do you think of people who use surrogate mothers?,2/19/2008 0:34
1019,888," I think its a great idea,  it creates options for people who cant or dont want to carry a baby. what do you think of it?",8/24/1973 20:58
1019,1019, I agree. It is humanity at its best.,5/27/2007 12:40
1020,1020, Been good chatting. ,1/19/2003 12:28
1020,1960, Hello do you like pop music?,2/14/1976 5:47
1020,1020," I do like pop music, I also like accordions though, did you hear about the big accordion Festival that is happening in Virginia?",11/26/1977 8:17
1020,1960, I didn't.  Could you tell me more about it?,9/17/2019 14:14
1020,1960," Yes it takes place in Falls Church, Virginia and there are going to be about a hundred and fifty people celebrating with accordions there",12/15/1979 11:02
1020,1960, That would be interesting to see.  Did it have anything to do with the 80th anniversary of the American Accordionists Association?,3/2/1984 6:45
1020,1020," Yes I think so. And that one of the people among them is Lou Coppola, he's been doing this and playing the accordion for about 28 years now",5/4/2004 22:12
1020,1020, Where is he from?,2/1/2012 23:15
1020,1960," He's originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, speaking of music though what kind of pop music do you like",5/18/2012 7:50
1020,1020, I like all kinds.  I grew up in the 80's so that pop music era is my favorite.  I was surprised to find out that the actor Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s/,12/9/1977 20:00
1021,633," Yeah that is shocking! It's also shocking that scientists determined the queen song, We Are the Champions, to be the catchiest song of all time LOL",4/10/1973 22:20
1021,633, lol That is funny.  I remember hearing that song so much at sports games while I was growing up.  The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. I wonder if they were any good? lol,8/26/1988 15:43
1021,1021," Wonder if one of those is the catchiest song of all time LOL I would guess not, did you know that North Korea has a K-pop girl band? And it is the most popular group in the country?",10/25/2009 23:37
1021,633, LOL You're probably right! hahaha  Do you like going to concerts?,2/8/2014 8:51
1021,1021," Yes I do like concerts. One of my favorite concerts I wish I could have gone to was Pink Floyd, what about you",1/28/1995 1:46
1021,633, I love going to concerts.  Used to go to tons of them back in the day when they were more affordable and played in areas that were easy for me to go to.  Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at an ancient Roman amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience. lol Wonder why they did that?,9/23/2011 13:44
1021,633, Yeah I hope they recorded that it's probably an amazing concert haha. What do you think about Creed though? They were sued because their concerts were so bad back in 2002,8/5/2011 13:39
1021,633," That must have been a really really bad show! lol  The Ramones played a lot of shows over a 20 year span...a total of 2,263 shows!",4/29/1982 10:09
1021,633," It is a lot of shows!  I do think that Lincoln Park is more impressive though, they did 324 concerts in only one year",12/9/2018 11:50
1021,633," Wow.  That is alot.  In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphitheatre that is still used for concerts.  That would be cool to see a show in a setting like that.  ",8/9/2021 13:37
1022,1022," I agree with you! I want to see some guitar playing in that Amphitheatre haha, Have you ever learn to play the guitar",2/5/2004 13:51
1022,1184, I used to play but wan't good.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks!  That's unique.,8/24/2017 21:13
1022,1022, That is really cool. Also cool is that Van Halen actually set a speaker on fire when he was playing a guitar solo LOL that's so metal,5/31/2015 7:15
1022,1022, Do you tend to follow elections in the country?,4/27/2017 22:09
1022,1022," Yes I plan to, it heard to decide who to vote for, I almost gave up on voting at one point.",10/8/1997 21:57
1022,1022, I know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option. I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years.,8/7/2019 20:05
1022,1022," Yes that's true, are you plan to vote in next election?",9/29/2019 1:58
1022,1022," I try to vote every time. I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now.",8/12/2002 15:23
1022,1022, Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president?,10/2/2021 1:14
1022,1022, I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too?,6/4/2013 16:25
1023,1205," Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change.",5/3/1983 12:39
1023,1205," That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more.",5/17/2022 20:09
1023,1205," Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader.",10/20/1987 2:18
1023,1205," Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser.",5/13/2003 14:56
1023,1205," That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion. ",3/2/1982 22:07
1023,1023," I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for.",9/8/2001 1:52
1023,1205," That's true such as jobs, health Insurance and so many other things.  I thinks a leader like that will be hard to find.",10/4/2013 11:40
1023,1205," The difficult part is that everyone has their own idea of what's best for the country, and sometimes the politicians they agree with don't fulfill their promises.",8/28/1983 14:47
1023,1205," You are right, since I was voting, Presidents speak of good things that people want to hear and after 8 years nothing change and this was going on for years.",11/13/2016 14:41
1023,1205," I think it would help to get some new faces in politics and reform some of the systems that may have worked decades ago, but aren't as functional in modern times.",1/27/1973 19:54
1024,1024," Did you know since 1900, the tallest candidate has won us presidential election 75% of the time? ",1/28/1979 23:19
1024,297," In that case, maybe the next candidates should invest in some stilts.",8/20/2010 21:02
1024,297," Hahaha, you are right, voters turnout for president election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.",6/8/2008 2:17
1024,297, Hopefully elections will take a turn to inspire people to vote more. It was good talking to you and finding a like mind about things!,12/27/1978 20:22
1024,297, Have you ever heard of the civil rights lawyer Michael Trister?,12/20/2007 22:22
1024,1024," No, was he black?",1/4/1998 14:44
1024,1024," That is my understanding, I believe he was forced from professorship in the late sixties, probably because he was black.",10/20/2002 17:25
1024,297," oh ok, how about john macain, he was a jeopardy contestant in 1965 ",2/16/1992 0:45
1024,1024," He was, I wonder how he did?  With the length of that show, and it's weekly showing there must be lots of now famous people that have been on it.",5/17/1983 15:42
1024,1024," probably, he also made a cameo in the movie wedding crashers",10/1/1971 0:43
1025,1025," Interesting that if you are born around the Panama canal you can be American, do we lease or own the land for the canal.  I know we pretty much built it.",12/28/2015 10:21
1025,1025," not sure, mccains mom is still alive and took race car driving classes in her late 90's!",2/22/2006 20:00
1025,270," They sound like an adventurous family, he must have got his courage from his mom.",3/9/1996 12:05
1025,1025," yeah! speaking of politics, voter turnout for presidential elections has not breached 62% in the last 100 years",3/11/2013 9:14
1025,1025," That's kind of sad, people can't complain if they don't vote,  In some countries, Australia for instance, you get fined for not voting.",7/1/2004 11:06
1025,1025," interesting, neveda is the only state that has none of these candidates voting option for pres elections",1/28/1980 12:11
1025,270, Do they keep a tally of how many times people check that.  I wonder what they'd do if that got the most checks.,2/14/2000 21:37
1025,1025," i wonder, and what if all the states had that option?",8/19/1980 20:50
1025,1025," The lawyers would have a field day, remember all that fuss in 2000 with the hanging chads.  If every State had none of the above win it would be chaos.",3/13/1977 21:06
1025,1025," definitely, funny fact, the taller presidential candidate has one 75% of the time since 1900",6/30/1974 19:26
1026,1583," I'm six four, maybe I missed my calling, I could have been president.  My height comes in useful at concerts, people are always complaining about me when I stand in front of them.",6/22/2013 19:45
1026,1026," funny, and who would think of keeping that data",12/4/2006 4:00
1026,1583," There's always someone keeping track of data, just ask Facebook.  Maybe one day out elections will be done over Facebook, it sounds like it has a higher participation rate than Presidential elections.",10/27/2005 22:22
1026,1583," ha true, nice chatting",6/8/2010 15:51
1026,1583," Have a good evening.  Have a good day.  Have a good morning.  Or as they do in Nevada, none of the above.  Bye",1/7/1970 19:49
1026,1026, Hey!,2/17/1970 12:34
1026,1583," Hello there, how are you doing? Do you attend many concerts these days?",3/6/1991 23:50
1026,1583," I am great! I haven't been to a concert in awhile, but have been to a lot in my life! How about you?",1/20/1975 17:36
1026,1026," Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time.  What would you say is your favorite ever?",10/4/2013 3:48
1026,1026," I would have to say Pink Floyd, or Linkin Park, there is so many! ",9/26/1979 17:00
1027,1531," That is awesome, I am a big Pink Floyd fan, well I kinda am, of their first album.  But any concert that they ever played would be really cool to attend. ",2/23/2011 5:53
1027,1027," Yes, they have the best shows that I have seen. Aerosmith puts on a great concert too.",12/8/2005 5:48
1027,1531," That sounds good as well.  I really like the Apples in Stereo, they put on a good show.  Radiohead was really good as well, although I really went to see the opening band, thats sad but true. ",7/29/2004 14:44
1027,1531," I love Radihead, who was the opening band at that concert?",4/4/2018 21:16
1027,1531," Yeah they are awesome, and I wasn't aware of how little they toured!  But I really wanted to see Steve Malkmus and the Jicks. ",4/24/2000 16:32
1027,1531," Oh wow, I haven't heard of them. I hope you enjoyed that concert though! ",4/26/2011 3:10
1027,1027," Yeah it was really good, I was in high school, I remember my friend and I went together, it was awesome. Alpine Valley in Wisconsin. ",7/19/2005 9:21
1027,1027, Cool! I have enjoyed every concert I have ever been to. I heard that there was a lawsuit against the band Creed for the show being so bad lol....I wonder how that worked out.,11/24/2005 19:33
1027,1027," Yeah that is so lame to me.  If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts. ",1/13/1991 3:25
1027,1531," Exactly! So do you ever go vote in the elections at all? Pretty sad John Mccain passed away but he went through a lot, so many people died in 2018. ",7/16/1971 0:53
1028,1028," Yeah there were a lot of good people who died this past year.  And yeah I do, did you know the voter turnout for US presidential elections hasn't gone over 62% in the last 100 years!?",1/13/1984 18:27
1028,1962, Really? That's it? more people need to get in to these elections because every vote counts!,1/11/1999 18:41
1028,1028," Yeah isn't that crazy, that seems way to low to even be true but it is. ",4/19/1977 12:37
1028,1028," Kind of sad really. I also heard that Michael Trister, civil rights lawyer died, a few people that did a lot of good have been passing lately. ",5/5/2004 16:16
1028,1028," Yeah that is sad as well.  Here is a really weird fact, did you know that just under the last 120 years, the taller presidential candidate has won 75% of the time?  Better start making that bet in vegas!",10/15/2001 13:31
1028,1028," Really? Haha, that's odd! I have a funny fact...John McCains mom....took race car driving classes and she is in her 90s! ",12/4/2022 4:00
1028,1962," That is super funny! I wonder what the fastest she ever drove was, legally or illegally? ",9/7/1995 3:14
1028,1962, I don't know how fast she went but being in her 90s she must have wanted to drive a race car really bad lol...no time like the present!     It has been great chatting!,3/14/1983 6:09
1028,1962," Yeah right, and yeah same here, I hope you have a good night. ",10/15/2001 13:53
1028,1962, did you know that john mccain was once on jeopardy 1965,7/12/2000 20:09
1029,1823, No I didn't know about that. Have you ever heard of Michael Trister by the way? He was a civil rights lawyer and died recently,7/9/2018 3:38
1029,1823," yes, pancreatic cancer. he did a lot of work with desegregation. ",10/26/2010 1:44
1029,1823," Yes he sounds like a great guy, also he lived until he was 77, which is a good life I think",5/3/2007 5:52
1029,1029, i loved that he was a lawyer for planned parenthood and unions too.,5/11/2004 23:55
1029,1029," He also helped a lot of people, for instance he created guidelines about lobbying and what each other's about election Law and Order to do the best job for advocating for the different causes",6/2/2003 3:30
1029,1823, yep. and he did so much worked with Mississippi Center for Justice. they do so much work opposing racial and economic injustices.  ,10/4/1988 13:48
1029,1029," Back to John McCain no, did you know that he voted against a Federal holiday for Martin Luther King",12/20/1982 16:25
1029,1823, I did. he had some problematic votes and opinions while he was serving as a senator.  i think he is also one of the few senators to cameo in a movie. ,4/17/1977 8:26
1029,1823, Yes you're right he made a cameo in that movieWedding Crashers I always thought that movie was pretty funny,10/3/1999 18:16
1029,1823, i wonder how many people voted the none of these candidates option when he ran on the nevada ticket. ,3/13/1977 9:49
1030,287, Yeah I wondered about that too. I probably would not use it myself because I would just vote for someone that I liked. Did you know with John McCain that you was actually born in the Panama Canal Zone,6/5/2010 15:26
1030,1030, was his father in the military as well?,1/26/1999 0:54
1030,287, Yes I think he was. He also had a media reputation for being called aMaverick,1/26/2005 9:02
1030,1030, i recall that was a big part of the 2008 elections where obama prevailed.,9/13/2008 5:06
1030,1030, Yep I think you're right. He was actually a former military officer and served as a US senator from 1987 until he died in 2018,11/16/2007 4:38
1030,287, in the current turmoil it stung to lose an unlikely semi ally. in ancient athens there werent elections cause they thought it would lead to oligarchy. they did it by a lottery system. imagine that,5/13/1988 20:22
1030,1030," Yeah I don't know about using a lottery system that sounds very dumb to me, but it is interesting that 75% of the time the taller candidate will win the presidential election",3/23/1992 23:42
1030,1030, thats an observation for sure. i wonder how that would change with voter reform and fairer votes in the electoral college. ,7/7/1984 1:45
1030,1030," Yes I'm not sure, but it is an interesting statistic, what are your thoughts on the fact that in 2012 us International election observers were banned from viewing the polls in 9 US states",9/22/1986 15:37
1030,1030, I think it is weird. ,3/11/1972 15:51
1031,331," Yes I wonder why that happened, it also makes me sad that our elections max out at 63% turnout that seems low",10/10/2005 12:46
1031,331, Are you a big google user?,11/25/2021 0:37
1031,1031," Yes, regularly use Google to do searches. You?",5/10/1975 1:17
1031,331, I use that and bing so I can earn some amazon gift cards.,8/15/1992 17:01
1031,1031, How does the gift card thing work?,5/4/1986 8:35
1031,331, Look up bing rewards.  You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998?,4/24/1984 8:03
1031,331, Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering!,10/8/1988 6:58
1031,1031, Oh yeah!  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send men to the moon!,9/30/2009 22:43
1031,1031," Right. Mind-boggling, but shows advancements in tech. svcs. and products, doesn't it?",8/15/2012 22:28
1031,331, Yes!  Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting.,5/29/2010 10:27
1032,1032," Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located?",12/4/1999 20:53
1032,1032, I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it.,2/17/2016 9:48
1032,1032," Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really?",10/14/2014 0:12
1032,1876, It might be.  I'm a big Amazon customer.  Are you?,1/18/1992 16:48
1032,1876," In the past few years, have ordered books and supplies from Amazon, yes. They have - almost anything, don't they?",1/7/1983 4:21
1032,1032, Yes.  I have Prime and we got rid of the cable because the video streaming service for Prime is worth the price of Prime every year.,2/20/2012 14:58
1032,1876," Heard that streaming is great, and that Amazon is producing original fillms and TV shows. My fav. is The Grand Tour.",6/27/1970 12:26
1032,1032, My kids like the Grand Tour.  Amazon now will even deliver your packages on Sundays because they have a contract with the US post office for the delivery service.,8/19/1976 8:37
1032,1876," Convenient, too. If we lived in China, the giant e-commerce co. would be Alibaba. Did you know its founder was turned down by Harvard & Yale as an under-grad. student? Think they're sorry, now?",10/21/1971 2:25
1032,1876," I didn't know that!  I bet they are.  Jeff Bezos has made so much money off of Amazon that he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years!",11/11/1982 14:13
1033,1033," Far out - in time, that is. Brilliant guy, though. Has vision. Even named a building on Amazon's Seattle campus after his 1st Amazon customer! Why not?",11/28/1980 21:03
1033,1033, That is neat!  IMDB is also owned by Amazon since 1998.,9/28/1997 3:37
1033,1033," Yes. Whether it's Amazon (big, powerful warriors) or Alibaba (magical) the AI these giants employ is beyond me. How about you?",6/1/2009 23:27
1033,1601, AI scares me.  lol  I don't trust it.  It's been a good chat. ,9/17/1982 9:24
1033,1033," Enjoyed your comments, thanks. Cheers!",12/3/1978 16:23
1033,1601, Have a good day!  Thanks as well!,1/1/2002 11:38
1033,1601, Do you like the piano?,4/23/1972 5:45
1033,1033, I love the piano!  I am not able to play well though.,6/5/2010 22:28
1033,1601, I took lesson but dropped out. Its been around since 1700,4/25/2002 8:15
1033,1601, There are pianos everywhere.  There was even one on the Hindenburg.  ,6/30/1972 8:52
1034,483," Wow, thats nuts.  Did you know there are aluminum pianos?",1/25/1980 11:34
1034,483, I heard they weigh 356 pounds.  Seems like a lot but pretty light for a piano.,8/21/1999 9:41
1034,483, Yes for airships.,9/6/1994 15:30
1034,1034," I wonder if those are also at the top of mountains, like the one in Britain?",1/10/2012 8:01
1034,483, I heard about that in 2006 when climbers found it,10/30/1985 2:48
1034,1034, I wonder how it got there.  I mean it is not like they are small...,11/29/1990 20:35
1034,483, Had to be helicoptered up I am sure.  ,5/26/2010 7:32
1034,483," Definitely not carrying that up in my pack, even if my girlfriend insists on taking it with us.",10/8/1973 12:23
1034,1034, Amazing sound though from strings being struck by hammers.,4/18/2003 2:31
1034,1034," Yeah, tons of intricate parts.  Did you hear that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney both recorded some of their famous music on the same piano?",2/24/1999 15:42
1035,1035," Yes, hey jude was performed and recorded with that piano",10/15/1977 14:02
1035,1035," Such talented musicians, the both of them.  I would have loved to see Freddie in concert!",10/8/2016 4:03
1035,1035, Yes nothing like live music in front of an audience.,11/30/2010 16:16
1035,656," Not like the one concert Pink Floyd recorded Live, no audience!",3/3/2010 21:18
1035,656," Wow, at the amphitheater I hear.  ",7/22/2018 11:27
1035,1035, In Pompeii at that!  How cool!,8/29/1971 21:12
1035,656," Yes, that is right!  Great chat, have a good night.",5/25/1973 20:55
1035,1035, You too!  ,2/14/1978 10:48
1035,1035," Hi, do you use Amazon?",7/21/1990 4:13
1035,656," Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence?",7/4/2006 17:21
1036,1036, All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields.,10/31/2021 21:24
1036,1789," Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence.",3/8/1982 11:22
1036,1036, Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks.,10/15/2005 21:04
1036,1789, I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.,2/20/2008 9:36
1036,1789," I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading.",9/13/2010 15:24
1036,1036," I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'.",9/5/2022 12:25
1036,1036, What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence?,10/14/1985 2:38
1036,1036," Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.'",11/12/2009 23:43
1036,1036," I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid.",6/17/1979 20:54
1036,1036, I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go.,3/26/2015 21:51
1037,1037," I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously.",12/14/2015 21:04
1037,1037," Yes, computers could NEVER actually think like humans can although they can autonomously operate cars, provide intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.",6/14/1987 9:23
1037,1037, Yes they can really help us out when the task is something that lends itself to automation but not when there are moral or ethical complications.,1/7/2016 20:10
1037,359, Very true. Did you know that Stanford's free AI class uses Google plus Hangouts to help them teach more effectively?,2/16/2012 1:42
1037,359," I did not know that, I have used Google Hangouts for interviews and meetings. We even used it once for a fantasy football draft that a lot of people couldn't attend in person.",1/4/2005 4:07
1037,359, Awesome use of it. Did you know that there is a non-profit organization for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence?,8/16/1974 21:44
1037,359," That's great, it's an area that we should definitely fund as there are a lot of great applications of the technology. Just the medical field alone could immensely benefit from it.",4/2/1971 4:38
1037,359," I agree, even Facebook is developing an AI designed to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict user actions.",11/5/2012 13:49
1037,1037, Facebook may be the one company I don't trust with AI after all their recent data scandals. It was very interesting to chat AI with you and I definitely learned a few new things.,7/7/1993 16:51
1037,359, Nice chatting with you as well.,3/11/1984 7:34
1038,1038, Its crazy how Google and Amazon have grown,1/4/1982 21:36
1038,1621, It's hard to even believe Google has been around for over twenty years.,5/7/1990 14:51
1038,1621," I know right, seems like its been around forever",9/26/2000 16:27
1038,1621," And Amazon has been around even longer, since 1994.",1/2/2004 1:12
1038,1621," Its a long time, Amazon started as an online bookstore right?",9/12/1973 23:52
1038,1038," Yes, but now it's largest Internet retailer in the world!",7/18/1998 10:22
1038,1621," It is, it sells everything from books to groceries to pet supplies you name it, I love the company",8/18/2006 16:50
1038,1621, It also sells low-end and affordable products under its own brand called AmazonBasics.,4/22/2002 16:48
1038,1621, Have you tried the Amazon Basics products?,1/24/1996 18:34
1038,1621," Sure. I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it.",4/22/2012 23:42
1039,1039," I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University",3/2/2013 0:53
1039,1039," Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power.",10/26/2017 7:08
1039,40," I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc",10/1/1987 12:51
1039,1039," Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet.",8/19/2022 7:22
1039,40," A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app?",5/26/2019 18:38
1039,40," Yeah, it's interesting how they determine the borders of countries with disputed borders.",1/1/2020 22:20
1039,40," I agree, interesting and they also calculate traffic using android devices that are in movement on the road, thats just genius and bit invasive",7/19/1976 23:31
1039,40," Definitely, though everything is invasive these days, so what are you going to do? Did you know it takes more computing power for a Google search than it did for Neil Armstrong to go to the moon? That's insane!",6/7/2013 18:52
1039,1039," Yeah if you have nothing to hide then theres nothing to worry about right? and no I didnt know that, thats an amazing fact",10/24/2005 19:13
1039,1039," They care a little about the environment, I imagine, too. Once, they hired hundreds of goats to mow the laws at Googeplex instead of people.",5/3/1984 2:50
1040,1040, Thats an efficient way to get things done lol,10/19/1998 23:58
1040,1235," Yeah, they're located in California, unsurprisingly since its founders went to school there.",3/12/2022 4:09
1040,1235," Hello there, do you use Amazon much?",3/2/2011 5:00
1040,1040, Hey yeah I love Amazon use it all the time! Hard to believe amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day.,7/17/2010 4:48
1040,1235," Yeah I use it quite a bit myself, and it is hard to believe, I would think no more than 2 or 3. ",5/2/2017 9:54
1040,1235, Yea that seems more accurate. Also I was interested to know IMDB is owned by Amazon. ,12/21/2016 16:52
1040,1040," Yeah I didn't know that about them, I wonder how many other things they own?",8/15/1976 11:34
1040,1235, Yeah good question. I respect Bezos though. He built the largest internet retailer in the world all the way back in 1994.,9/2/1976 3:43
1040,1040," Yeah Bezos is a great businessman.  Did you know he built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years?",12/8/2000 19:15
1040,1235," Whoa I would like to see that. The Amazon contract with USPS must explain how they are able to deliver packages so fast, even on Sundays!",2/5/1980 5:48
1041,1041, Yeah I wonder how the postal employees felt when they learned that Sundays are no longer off days for all. ,12/24/1976 3:41
1041,442, Yeah I bet that didn't go over so well. But only a matter of time until Artificial Intelligence will start delivering for Amazon. There is even a non profit organization for the advancement of AI.,5/16/2020 15:06
1041,442," I think I read that, I wonder who funds that kind of organization?",7/12/2021 5:16
1041,442, Yeah good question I'm not sure. AI is definitely good at solving puzzles though as it crushed all human records in the puzzle game 2048. ,10/8/1977 16:18
1041,442," That is pretty impressive, did you know the actress Kristen Stewart once co-authored a paper on AI?",6/28/2022 4:30
1041,442, I didn't take that actress for the scientific type. I would like to attend one of Stanford's free AI classes.,8/25/2011 11:39
1041,1041," Yeah same here, I think that would be very interesting to sit in on a class or two. ",7/25/1970 3:18
1041,442, Very much so! I just hope machines don't become so capable that they start to perform things without commands!,5/23/2009 3:30
1041,1041," Yeah and that is where it starts to get scary, especially if we give them a lot of control. ",8/27/1982 14:52
1041,442, Yeah. There has to be a fine line between helping us out but not taking over. I would think that google would make a good AI. Google once used hundreds of goats to trim it's lawns instead of making people do it.,2/4/1991 18:01
1042,1042," I read that before, that is so crazy!  I wonder what other people that didn't work there think of them. ",12/27/2015 16:01
1042,1724, Yeah I bet they think positively of them. A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon. That is quite surprising. ,3/16/1975 7:31
1042,1724," Holy cow, it's crazy how far tech has come.  Well it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good one!",10/8/2021 13:27
1042,1042, Hi are you a big fan of google?  They have really became one powerful company.,9/15/1998 22:45
1042,1042," I use Google every day.  It is hard not to.  When Google is down, almost all web traffic is down also.",4/9/1980 20:44
1042,1042, Yes!  I can't believe they have been around over 20 years already since be founded in 1998.,7/30/1974 6:35
1042,1042," An innovative company, they are.  They once used live goats instead of people to mow their lawns!",11/24/1986 1:33
1042,1042," That is kind of neat.  I'm surprised I haven't seen that happen before.  When there is a disputed border, google maps will tailor their maps to the claims of each country where the interenet browser is located.  Weird and kind of odd fact.",4/20/2020 18:13
1042,1042, Technology is progressing so rapidly.  I think it is an interesting that what we refer to as AI constantly changes.  What was considered AI before is normal now.,3/10/2014 15:09
1042,1042, AI has really come on strong in the last 2 years.  AI crushed all human records in the puzzle game 2048.,10/2/2007 6:11
1043,288, I think it is an important idea to focus on the human aspect as we become more technologically advanced.  That's the focus people in Silicon Valley are taking.,3/11/2010 4:25
1043,1043," I agree.  Facebook is developing an AI desinged to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict users actions.",6/10/2022 2:13
1043,288, I admire John Doerr for writing a book about how to make people work together more productively.,5/27/2020 1:35
1043,288," I'm going to have to look that book up.  I'm not familiar with him or the book.  Speaking of books, I didn't know Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper about AI.",1/19/1991 6:34
1043,288," Yeah, you should read the book.  Learning how to make teams work together more productively is useful because companies perform better when their teams are more motivated I guess.",2/6/2000 0:44
1043,288, I'm going to look it up when we're done here.  Are you a big Amazon user?  I am.,3/2/1999 20:24
1043,288," Yes, I use Amazon all the time.  I suppose it's hard not to use Amazon either.  They are the largest internet retailer in the world.",4/4/2000 21:24
1043,288, I agree.  I didn't know that they also owned IMDB since 1998.  Probably so they could direct people to buy the movies over at Amazon. lol,9/22/1993 1:07
1043,1043," Yeah, it seems like they are grabbing the market anywhere they can, from books, entertainment, and much more.",8/9/2008 18:51
1043,288," They even have their own in-house brand called AmazonBasics, which sells low-end products. ",8/31/1978 15:40
1044,1006, They even control more than it seems because they are a cloud provider.  It's almost like they are becoming the internet.,10/3/1991 3:13
1044,1044, It's kind of sad that all these brick and mortar stores are closing because of all this technology.  Amazon has a contract with the US postal service to deliver packages on Sundays now too.  Pretty soon groceries will be coming to your doorstep too.,8/28/2003 15:39
1044,1044, I think we should maintain a keen perspective on all the technologies that we are creating.  Risks and dangers should be constantly assessed.,3/23/1977 7:51
1044,1044, I agree.  I'm surprised at how many people are using the grocery shoppers now.  I was in Walmart the other day and I was amazed at how many workers were picking items for customers.  We know someone who does it and the Walmart they work at there is enough demand for 4 full time employees to do nothing but shop all day.  That to me is just craziness.  I have to get running.  I had a good time chatting with you.,10/21/1986 11:15
1044,1006, Yeah I had a good time too.  Have a good day.  Bye!,5/27/2002 9:35
1044,1006," lol, On april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. Did You hear about that ?",3/2/2003 12:39
1044,1044, No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news,9/19/2001 18:14
1044,1006," what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;)",3/3/2013 19:38
1044,1044," Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it.",10/1/1975 3:47
1044,1044, I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol,2/11/2008 15:49
1045,1045," They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away!",7/14/2004 6:20
1045,1045," Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take Piano man instead of news any day ;)",11/9/2019 14:12
1045,1091," It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young.",9/20/2018 20:24
1045,1045," hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;)",2/18/2006 3:15
1045,1045, Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts?,9/11/2020 2:46
1045,1045," Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;)",1/21/1975 2:27
1045,1045," You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket.",1/12/1974 18:01
1045,1045," Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure...",6/9/1987 1:40
1045,1091," Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice. That's all I got on Classical music.",9/6/2004 8:53
1045,1045," I'm not too close to classical music, but I did like the soundtrack to Space Odyssey 2001 - it's as close to classical I got ;)",8/11/1998 13:16
1046,1046," LOL....I hear ya. Oh, and sorry for the spelling, it was 10 Disc and box set I meant. I'm gonna get killed for that....lol",8/6/1990 3:28
1046,1046," lol, yeah I figured that one out ;) although You never know with those Srab Sheik - they like to have a good time :)",10/13/2005 10:22
1046,1046," LOL. So, let's see, I covered piano, concert, and classical. Anything else you'd like to bring up? Been nice chattin' with ya!",7/8/1989 11:55
1046,257," Something I'm sure You're aware of - In 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience. I have that video ;) amazing piece :)",10/1/1977 20:04
1046,257," I've heard of it, but never knew it was filmed! I'm gonna hafta Youtube it and see if I can find anything on it...so I can watch a good sounding piano (keeping on the topic). ",4/11/1980 17:28
1046,257, lol ;) that one was more psychodelic ;) not everybody likes stuff like that ;),7/7/2018 7:02
1046,1046, No wonder there wasn't an audience for that concert.....lol. ,7/3/2020 7:35
1046,257," lol ;) I loved it ! for those times, it was something truly amazing ! ;)",10/19/2010 19:00
1046,1046, I'm gonna see if I can find that concert. I'd like to see it. Have a Great day!,12/23/2005 10:07
1046,257," You too, thank You for a great chat !",2/24/1991 15:58
1047,1058, Absolutely....,1/28/1978 12:10
1047,1058, Have a healthy New Year ;),7/17/2012 4:46
1047,1047," Hi there, did you hear that Amazon pulled out of its decision to build its second headquarters in NY today?",5/11/1999 14:56
1047,1058," I didn't hear that.  They have so many locations, and such a wide reach.  Jeff Bezos certainly has vision",4/17/2015 3:10
1047,1058," Yes, it's crazy that they started out as an online bookstore and now it's so big it's the largest internet retailer in the world",6/11/2005 9:36
1047,1058, They even own imdb!,10/14/1976 12:17
1047,1047," I guess it makes sense that once they had that property, they'd move into streaming video and producing their own content with Amazon Studios",1/11/1979 16:24
1047,1058," They certianly have capitalized off their success, even getting USPS to deliver packages on sunday",7/14/1988 12:27
1047,1058," Yes, and their own workers move a lot of packages, too. A warehouse workers walks between 7 and 15 miles over the course of a daily shift.",8/23/1990 16:08
1047,1058," That seems like a lot, I wonder how soon before they start replacing them with AI?",1/24/2007 20:45
1048,1598," It's only a matter of developing the technology to a point where the automation is cheaper. There is actually a non-profit organization for the advancement on AI, I wonder what kind of people contribute to that!",7/10/2012 19:30
1048,1598," Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way",2/14/1975 22:14
1048,1048," Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology.",7/12/1982 12:10
1048,1048, I personally am excited to see further development in the self driving car type of technology.,4/3/2007 18:36
1048,1598," I love driving, so I'm not personally excited to use that, but I think it's better than dealing with all of the distracted drivers on the road because they're looking at their phones. Google actually calculates traffic using the movement of Android devices on the road!",7/2/1989 3:56
1048,1048," I didn't know that.  Thats pretty cool, I was wondering how they got that info, I knew it couldn't be just people logged on to maps.",9/18/1995 0:14
1048,1598," Yes, I guess you have to watch what you agree to! I bet the some agreements are even drafted by AI",12/9/2002 4:09
1048,1048," Probably, those things I never read and now I owe them not only my soul, but all the winnings if I were to ever hit the lotto.  lol.  Ive heard Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI",3/7/1978 13:55
1048,1598, That seems a bit ironic haha. Maybe she took Stanford's free class on AI that uses Google Plus Hangouts and shared her lovely personality.,4/21/1981 14:59
1048,1598, Lol.  Maybe she did.,11/9/2010 5:41
1049,1049," Yes, it's a good thing Facebook has so many users and photos with which to train its AI to understand emotion and recognize objects",5/23/2014 8:01
1049,1010, It always gets me when I post photos that automatically tag me or my friends.  ,10/15/1984 7:14
1049,1010, I guess the cost of a free product is privacy! Maybe part of the next frontier with AI is using it to create believable fake identities to trick other AI algorithms with lol,5/2/1980 3:32
1049,1049, That would be crazy.  Its been great chatting!,12/30/1990 14:59
1049,1049, Good night!,4/29/1975 12:23
1049,1010, Do you enjoy classical music?,7/29/1985 16:13
1049,1049," I do, I listen to classical music when Im working what about you?",7/9/1973 5:08
1049,1010," I enjoy listening to classical music in a serene space, but did you know classical music concerts originally had loud wild audiences?",3/12/2007 6:56
1049,1010," I didnt thats a cool fact, another cool fact is that a computer composed a classical music master piece back in 2011",3/9/2004 3:46
1049,1010," I wonder if it was any good? In any case, classical music isn't just music. Cities are using it to successfully deter crime in public space with remarkable results",9/15/2020 15:21
1050,1050, They are? that application is suprising and new to me have you attended any good concerts lately?,11/29/1987 12:12
1050,1050, I recently attended Joe Hisaishi's concert. He has amazing melodies and it would be perfect music to listen to in a beautifully scenic place in nature,6/20/2017 17:06
1050,1050," I haven heard of that artist I might look him up in Youtube later today, there is a roman amphitheatre in Cratia that its still used for concerts, it would be amazing to attend a concert there",2/15/2005 7:52
1050,1050," did you know creed concerts entered into 4 lawsuits, I think I would be fine",12/27/2002 10:28
1050,1050," Thats too bad Creed used to be a great band, do you like Linking Park?",12/1/1980 1:26
1050,1698, They are pretty good and they even had 300+ concerts in 2001 alone due to their sucess,3/26/1990 13:41
1050,1698," Thats a lot of concerts for a year, I loved their first album it was a success indeed.",9/7/1987 22:18
1050,1050, Speaking of concerts have you ever listened to the ramones? They played a total of 2000 concerts and toured for nearly 20 years,2/9/2012 16:38
1050,1050," I have too bad I didnt make it to any of their concerts, they are a really talented group.",1/8/1978 11:40
1050,1698, I agree. Personally I am a fan of the piano for most songs,10/20/1994 10:36
1051,1051," Piano is a great instrument I really like it, it has such a relaxing tone, in the 30s the BBC network decided to broadcast piano music instead of the news",12/6/1991 14:18
1051,1051, Did you know a group of climber reach britain's highest mountain peak and found a piano. Someone must really like the piano,2/18/1983 5:23
1051,50," I agree I would be too busy getting freezed to play the piano, that must require a lot of hard physical work though.",1/18/1992 13:22
1051,50, I sure respect Bartolomeo for inventing such a beautiful instrument so far back in the 1700s.,8/7/1996 22:49
1051,50," Wow that was 300 years ago! the piano is an old instrument, there is also an aluminum grand piano",6/9/2002 17:23
1051,1051, I didn't know that. In any case thank you for the chat. I am going to look up what the aluminum grand piano looks like after this chat.,5/18/2014 18:22
1051,50, Have you ever visited Silicon Valley? I know that it's in California,7/20/2016 10:12
1051,50, I haven't. I am sure it is something to be seen.,8/8/1984 6:48
1051,1051," You been to Google's headquarters? It is in Silicon Valley, they are the largest search engine in the world",2/20/1980 3:58
1051,1051," No, but we have a big distribution center in my city and I have been there. Can you believe Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years?",3/8/2016 12:54
1052,1052, No that's a really crazy thing to build. What do you think about the fact that the first customer to buy something on Amazon got a building named after him,8/24/2013 1:41
1052,1052, I wish I was that person! When I was at Amazon I walked miles. Did you know that the workers walk between 7-15 miles each day. I believe it!,2/9/2002 21:25
1052,1052," Wow that is crazy that's a lot of calories to burn in a day! I'm just glad that Amazon has an exclusive contract with USPS to deliver on Sundays, that makes me happy",6/5/1977 23:55
1052,1052, Me too! I see them out delivering all the time!,10/18/2005 8:28
1052,1052," Yeah I've seen them too, do you ever use the site IMDb by the way?",4/10/1994 17:47
1052,625, Yes. When I want to find out more about a person who is in the entertainment industry.,6/27/1974 3:40
1052,625," Yep I use that site almost everyday, it's crazy that Amazon owns them, they own almost everything LOL",6/10/2002 1:06
1052,1052, Yes they do. Do you think it is crazy that instead of hiring a lawn crew that google had goats mow the lawns.],2/19/2013 23:25
1052,625, I do think that's crazy. But I guess it is environmentally friendly. corraling hundreds of live goats to mow a law is a crazy thing to try to do,6/2/2012 13:34
1052,625, But effective! Did you know that google maps calculates traffic on how fast android devices are moving on the road. WHat about Apple people?,9/23/1999 13:47
1053,154," That is really interesting. I love how these companies can use AI now, do you know who Kristen Stewart is by the way?",6/26/1996 12:25
1053,1053, Not sure? Who is she?,2/20/2000 20:28
1053,154, She's the actress from the Twilight movies. Apparently she even wrote a paper about artificial intelligence which I did not think she would be interested in,11/12/1978 15:52
1053,154, I agree! I know who you are talking about now. That is kind of crazy! I heard that there is a non-profit org for the advancement of artificial intelligence. ,3/2/2005 0:06
1053,154, Yeah I think you're right. It's all so crazy that Facebook is creating its own artificial intelligence to identify objects in photos,6/14/1989 9:53
1053,154, They are on the cutting edge. That is really cool. ,8/5/1996 11:41
1053,154," Yes I agree, they also want to be able to predict their users actions which is scary to me",5/30/1971 15:00
1053,154, Winter is getting old.  I'm ready to see birds migrating back north from Mexico; that would be a welcome sight.,2/24/1978 3:39
1053,1053," Yea birds are pretty interesting, i find their light weight skeleton fascinating ",11/2/1983 17:45
1053,1053, It's hard to believe that their skeletons actually weigh less than their feathers with those hollow bones.,6/2/1973 22:40
1054,668," Yea, they are quite successful species with over ten thousand species currently living",3/2/1994 18:18
1054,1054, I guess some in Australia can mimic lots of sounds like cameras and chainsaws.  Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad.,3/7/1992 7:50
1054,1054, I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors,11/14/1999 13:30
1054,1054," Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.  I've never seen them live, but I have been to a few good amphitheatre shows: John Mellencamp, Tome, Petty, and KISS were really good.",4/1/1975 23:27
1054,1054," Apparently Deep Purple has the record for loudest concert, it left three audience members unconscious",9/9/2005 1:52
1054,668," Holy cow, that had to be something.  Those classic acts had it going on.  The Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years; that is commitment to the craft, no doubt.",8/17/2016 0:06
1054,1054," That is impressive, they've must of made a lot of money but probably not as much Abba was offered to do a reunion tour, they turned down 1 billion dollars",8/11/2007 5:23
1054,668," I did not know that.  For that kind of money, I think I could put grudges or reservations aside.  You could buy a lot of tacos for 1 billion dollars.",5/11/1971 12:41
1054,1054, Yea I never even thought Abba was that in demand to offer 1 billion to do 100 concerts,4/10/1993 18:54
1054,668," I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad.",12/21/2009 2:54
1055,1055, Yea that is unfortunate. Do you follow world events much. In 2010 there was a global tiger summit that russia pledged 330 million dollars to,8/10/2011 18:25
1055,1055," I like keeping up on politics, but I did not know that fact.  However, I heard once that they gave out phone chargers and thumb drives infected with trojan viruses at one G20 summit.  That seems to go against the very nature of a summit.",10/25/1970 16:35
1055,1055," Yes but I guess security is lacking at a lot of summits, in 2007 a man dressed as Osama bin Laden was able to get pass security of the Apec summit",3/14/2002 7:40
1055,1055, Really?  You would think that security might be a bit tighter at these things.  Especially with the heads of state from so many powerful countries there.  It's almost like inviting someone to harm world leaders.  ,5/23/2001 0:12
1055,991, Yea but I guess security is hard to do with the increase in Summits since the end of the Cold War,3/21/2005 1:35
1055,1055," True, now there has been an increase in summit events since then, so it's probably harder to keep them all safe.  ",4/8/2019 18:05
1055,991," Yea, they even have a summit on St Patrick's day where the Irish Prime Minister visits the US President",11/7/1977 0:58
1055,991," Really, that is cool.  That one is probably low stress compared to one with Putin or leaders from China.  ",8/5/2020 12:34
1055,991," Yea, especially the early ones with FDR, Stalin and Chruchill during WWII",6/21/2010 12:05
1055,991," It would have been amazing to witness those.  Those were three strong, influential, history-changing leaders.  ",12/26/1970 8:03
1056,1399," well i got to go, nice talking with you",4/29/2019 8:27
1056,1056, Are movies your kind of entertainment?,12/3/1983 15:29
1056,1399, Yeah I like movies. Im particularly fond of Stehpen speilberg films.,11/24/1985 3:45
1056,1399," Do you have a favorite?  We just watched Empire of the Sun, it had a very young Christian Bale in it!",12/4/1995 20:19
1056,1056, I like the jurassic park movies a lot. Me and my son like watching stff like that he loves dinosars.,10/1/2020 21:55
1056,1056," My son too, he keeps telling me when the new Jurassic movies are coming out, 2020 apparently.",11/23/1986 8:02
1056,1056, Thats awesome. I hadnt heard abot a new one. Fnny thing about Speilberg. When he rode the jurassic park ride he asked to be let off before the 84 foot drop. I can nderstand what he is going through there thogh. Im not a big rollercoaster fan.,5/15/2005 6:19
1056,1399," Same here.  My son loves Cedar Point in Ohio, we take him and he goes on all the big rides while I sit and watch.  I guess everyone seeks their own entertainment.",3/7/2017 22:09
1056,1056, Yeah I went on a roller coaster when i was little that did a flip. Then it went backwards and did the flip again. I have hated them ever sense. ,9/19/1988 3:53
1056,1399," I think I'll stick to the movies.  Have you ever seen the movie Moon?  It's about ten years old now, it was made by David Bowie's son Duncan Jones.",2/16/2001 16:53
1057,1030, No I havent seen it is it good.,5/2/2012 14:46
1057,1057, It's interesting in a small movie way.  Clever story with a nice twist at the end.  ,6/13/2008 2:35
1057,1030, Ill have to check it out. One of the earliest movies I an remember seeing is ET. My mom liked it when I was a kid. ,4/18/1971 6:21
1057,1057," I remember that one when I was at school, I had to wait until it was on VHS.  I also recall be scared by Close Encounters, it took me nearly ten years to watch it.",1/10/2020 9:25
1057,1030, I wasnt one for scary movies either. My sister loved them even when she was a little kid. Did yo ever see Schindlers list.We watched that one in school. ,10/20/1992 18:01
1057,1057," Yes, I remember going with my dad.  It almost felt like we had to go.  It's amazing how a movie maker can go from big popcorn movies like E.T. to a serious movie such as Schindler's List.",3/7/1998 12:52
1057,1030, Yeah that movie was deep. I took an elective class in high school on the holocaust and we watched it. That was a screwed up time in history. Man the way they lined p the Jews and shot them in rows to save bullets. That always sticks out to me as a prime example of how sick and screwed up the Germans were at that time. Not worried about the lives they took at all just how many bullets they used doing it.,1/17/1988 15:14
1057,1030," I know, it affected me a lot at the time.  I'd also recently been to Germany and seen one of those concentration camps.  I don't know how people can become like that.",12/30/2004 18:19
1057,1030, I also remember the goonies. That ones a classic in my book. Speilberg flew the entire cast to Hawaii after they were done shootiIng Man they have made some money off that movie. ,4/5/1979 8:58
1057,1030, We just showed that one to the kids.  We had forgotten about all the swearing in it.  It's funny how memory works.,1/29/1986 12:17
1058,1176, Yeah it is. Well its been good talking to ya this morning. I got to be gettin ready for work. I dont want to though. Its cold out there.,1/11/2011 5:17
1058,1058," Have a good day, bye",11/19/1981 6:16
1058,1058," Hi, how are you?",10/16/2021 4:23
1058,1176, Me? i guess im pretty good. how are you doing? everything going all right? get enough to eat there? thats good. what do you think about the moon?,11/8/1974 10:16
1058,1058," I'm good, thanks for asking.  It's so overcast, I can't really see it tonight.  How about you?",2/16/1971 13:11
1058,1058," i have not looked at the moon recently, but i think that it has been doing all right. The highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt. everest! I wonder if they have 3g and wireless up there.",2/5/1989 19:16
1058,1058," I doubt it, but you never know? Lol I hear moon dust can cut through Kevlar like material and is harmful to us humans.",4/23/2000 9:01
1058,1176," boy, that is good to know. i never realized the dangers of visiting the moon. i guess ill wait until disney sets up a theme park there. when does spielberg make his first dinosaur moon movie?",1/1/1974 22:28
1058,1058," That's cool!  Well if anyone could make a movie like that it would be Spielberg.  He's made some good ones, Jaws, E.T. The Color purple,and Jurassic Park, just to name a few.",9/15/2017 7:43
1058,1176, dinosaurs on the moon. shot on location. that would be great! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until Jaws.,3/5/1995 13:07
1059,1644," Now, it's the best time.  My how times change!  Did you know he played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack?",1/28/2019 4:14
1059,1644, he is a gifted artist. i wonder how good his clarinet skills are. why did he get that gig? he made enough as the director.,12/11/2017 7:00
1059,1059, Can you say control?  I read he still makes millions from Star Wars off a bet he made with George Lucas in 1977.,9/2/2000 17:28
1059,1059," yes, that bet about star wars and close encounters. george really blew it on that one. that is funny. still george has billions. ",2/20/1993 8:49
1059,1644, What's a friendly wager among billionaire friends?  ,7/11/1978 8:46
1059,1059," at the time, they were not billionaires. but george learned the value of his franchise. he made a ton off other movies before though. ",1/25/1986 10:48
1059,1059," On a side note, do you know that when Caesar visited Britain a long time ago, he saw the people there not eating chickens , but using them as entertainment?",1/26/2004 1:38
1059,1644, there was not much for entertainment there and then. i guess they had other sources of protein. maybe the britons bet on the chicks?,9/24/1974 9:54
1059,1644," I'm sure they were talking about cock fighting, still goes on today.  It's just illegal now if you get caught doing it! Lol Still, I think I would have fried up the under performing birds and watch the better fighters do their thang!",2/7/1979 3:11
1059,1059," the Britons probably ate something from chickens. maybe the eggs? I dunno. They did not have the NES for entertainment, so they had to use chickens.",2/28/2015 17:45
1060,1140," You know, that thing was only discontinued in Japan in 2003.  Hard to believe it held on so long, there!",10/28/1999 18:21
1060,1060, i think that the Japanese are die hard fans. they wanted to keep buying the games. i dont know why. there have been many better systems.,10/13/1971 21:08
1060,1140," Yes, you're right about that.  Well, it's been nice chatting.  Enjoy the rest of your evening.",5/28/2005 16:38
1060,1140, What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?,5/21/1992 20:58
1060,1060, I like movies.  I really like Steven Spielberg movies like E.T. and Indiana Jones.  What do you like?,7/10/2005 12:35
1060,1060," I like most types of entertainment designed to give pleasure and delight such as storytelling, music, drama, and etc. However, I too like Steven Spielberg's movies.",7/28/1987 0:15
1060,1060, Entertainment definitely takes all forms.  Back in 50bc people in Britain bred chickens for entertainment.,3/10/1985 10:07
1060,1060, I wonder if that has anything to do with the mass produced meaty chickens of today? Personally I spent a lot of time with the Nintendo entertainment systems.,4/15/2008 11:00
1060,1060, I like Nintendo too.  I don't care that the NES could only display 54 colors. It's enough.,10/14/2017 17:05
1060,1060," Too bad it was finally discontinued in 2003, but it has had a long run. Aside from the NES, I also watched Bill nye the science guy when I was younger too",3/5/2021 13:33
1061,1061, I watch him now with the Planetary Society.  Did you know he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest?,4/6/2015 18:09
1061,1061," I would have never know. I also enjoyed many steven spielberg movies like ET, which you previously mentioned.",8/6/1976 2:28
1061,1061," Yeah, Spielberg is an excellent director.  This is a little known fact but he also directed some shows on tv.",11/21/1977 16:56
1061,1061, Did you know he still makes millions for a star wars on a bet with george lucas in 1977,10/30/1980 16:39
1061,1061, I didn't know that but I have to admit that it says a lot about George Lucas to still be paying on a bet from so long ago.,5/28/2004 21:39
1061,1470, I mean it really shows how close both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are as friends. It probably also helps that they are filthy rich.,5/29/2006 20:37
1061,1061, That's true.  Spielberg is a nice guy.  He flew the whole cast of goonies to Hawaii and had a cookout.,4/8/1985 10:54
1061,1061, I mean his hits are so amazing that he change the very concept that summer was a bad time to release movies due to historically low sales by releasing jaws and we both know how that turned out,7/20/2014 5:29
1061,1470, Now it's a major thing to release movies in the summer.  I just wish he'd go back to making the kind of movies he did before. I know he likes addressing issues in movies currently but I like adventure and fantasy.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a fanastic movie! I can still hear the musical communication with the alien ship!,6/10/1987 23:00
1061,1061," Speaking of jaws, did you know he personally played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack? I really like it when the creators participate directly in their creations.",10/27/1974 0:29
1062,1062, I didn't know that. I had no idea he could play an instrument for that matter.  I like it too when they do that.  You know Jaws is considered the first summer blockbuster.,4/8/1989 20:49
1062,1062," I did not, but it makes sense since it changed the very perception of best times to release movies.",6/3/2004 9:37
1062,854, It really does.  Jaws planted a flag so to speak.  Just like NASA planting one on the moon.,9/16/2013 18:00
1062,1062," Indeed. In any case, it was a enjoyable chat, especially about Spielberg.",5/5/1987 22:50
1062,854, Yes it was.,1/20/1973 16:38
1062,854, Hi there! Have you ever had a pet bird?,1/31/2014 0:34
1062,854, No I haven't but I have memories of friends who did when I was growing up.  How about you?,1/2/2002 20:57
1062,854," Yes, I have had pet birds. I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon?",4/9/2014 13:28
1062,854," That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.  ",1/29/1987 8:23
1062,854, Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton! ,11/7/2013 14:50
1063,1788," That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne. ",10/26/1981 3:45
1063,1063," Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I was always curious how they built such strong little nests!",8/5/2018 13:27
1063,1063," That is so cool, I love learning about how different species in nature interact with each other to help themselves. ",11/1/1988 18:31
1063,1063," Yeah, we are learning so much about so many things, these days! There are birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of car alarms, cameras and chain saws. I wonder if they are mockingbirds.",6/13/1999 15:37
1063,1788," That is awesome, and yeah good one.  I wonder why they would mimic them as well?",11/2/1972 9:16
1063,1063," It's interesting, but I also find it kind of sad that they mimic human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating! ",12/2/2012 18:36
1063,1063," That is amazing for an animal to do that, sleeping is necessary, some animals sleep for crazy periods of time!",9/29/2010 16:14
1063,1788," It would be pretty neat if we evolved wings from our forelimbs! Birds are called Aves sometimes, which makes sense since we call large bird houses, aviaries.",3/19/1995 8:36
1063,1788," That would be really wild, and I didn't know that, it does make sense though with the aviaries.  And, aviation is air stuff too. ",8/16/2010 16:11
1063,1788," Ah yes, aviation as well! That one slipped my mind somehow! My favorite birds used to be penguins, but they almost don't even seem like birds to me!",1/9/1981 1:12
1064,152," I would agree, penguins seem like a different breed in general. I think birds are the closest living things to dinosaurs to be honest. ",11/15/2022 0:03
1064,152," Yeah, in hindsight and without DNA, if we'd have known that some have feathers and some fly, and some lay eggs. Maybe we could have put two and two together, after all!",12/11/2017 9:17
1064,1064," That is probably true, I just think you can really tell when you look at a birds feet, they look like how dinos did. ",4/17/1989 23:09
1064,152, Oh yeah and their cute little legs! They all kind of remind me of tiny dinosaurs! Emus remind me of pretty big dinosaurs! I'd love to have one as a pet! Their eggs are huge compared to a chicken's eggs! ,7/23/2019 21:59
1064,152," Yeah good call they sure do to me too!  And yeah those eggs are massive, I know people eat those and ostrich eggs. ",1/27/1988 7:32
1064,1064," Yeah, it would be really interesting to taste an ostrich egg! Hey, it has been so nice chatting with you! I've got to get some chores done. I hope you have a wonderful day!",7/25/2014 20:43
1064,152," Ok sounds good, yeah it was fun, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",6/29/2004 6:10
1064,1064, Do you enjoy dining at interesting restaurants?,2/25/1989 10:08
1064,1064," Hello there, I do enjoy going yes, how about you?",8/8/1973 11:00
1064,1064," I do when I can. I'd like to visit Mi Vida, a beautifully designed restaurant in Washington DC.",10/6/1977 8:50
1065,1065," It sounds really nice, and DC is a really fun place to visit I will say that as well. ",9/21/2005 2:58
1065,1499, It's got torches on pedestals and it faces the water on the Wharf. The drinks sound yummy too.,3/22/2001 22:02
1065,1065," Yeah they do, and fresh guacamole is always so good. ",9/7/2017 14:37
1065,1499, I'd try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips!,11/30/1972 21:17
1065,1065," Yeah that also sounds super good, I love tequila!",5/6/2022 7:33
1065,1065," Have you had queso fundido? It's like Mexican fondue, yum!",9/17/1994 21:16
1065,1499, Yeah I have tried that before and it is really good I would agree!,9/25/1994 16:03
1065,1499," Unfortunately it seems the service at the restaurant is not so great. That is one of the most important things, for me.",11/24/1985 17:37
1065,1499," Oh for sure, I have worked at a restaurant and it takes some skill to be good, but if not, bad service is the worst!",5/26/1987 21:17
1065,1499," I'm getting hungry. I'd love some chicken. Chicken is the only bird I would eat, even at a fancy restaurant.",9/1/1977 20:02
1066,1613," I like chicken as well.  Speaking of birds, did you know that they have regional accents?",5/28/1976 1:45
1066,1066," That is funny. I think I had heard that about cows, too. So like moo, meh, mewww? Haha Speaking of birds though, hummingbirds are smart. They steal spidewebs to fix their nests and to make new ones.",10/11/2019 4:00
1066,1066," I think I have read about that, very cool, would be fun to watch video of them doing it. ",4/7/2008 3:09
1066,1613, I bet they are really light. Most birds' bones are so hollow that the skeleton weighs less than the feathers.,3/31/1974 14:45
1066,1613," That is very interesting, I think they are the closest relatives to the dinosaurs as well. ",11/15/1980 0:50
1066,1066, Neat! And the dodo is also a close relative to the pigeon.,4/12/2000 18:25
1066,1613," Yeah it is!  Oh the dodo, I remember watching old videos of the dodo years ago. ",9/1/1971 5:00
1066,1613," Birds are persistent too. Some can fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping when they are migrating. Speaking of sleep, I'd love to take a nap! It was nice talking to you!",12/3/2021 18:29
1066,1066, Did you know about the wild birds in Australia and their pecularity?,6/16/1990 7:18
1066,1066, Can't say that I have. What about them?,8/17/1973 22:45
1067,1067," Well they mimic the sound of car alams, chainsaws and also cameras, ",11/15/1981 16:02
1067,497," Oh, that sounds like the lyre birds. I guess I have heard of them. Birds are neat. The reason they can fly is thanks to their almost hollow skeleton.",6/23/2018 4:56
1067,1067," That must be really funny to listen at lol, you know that birds have bones that are so hollow they can even weigh more than their feathers",11/15/1977 2:39
1067,1067," I believe it, especially when some of them are only two inches long. Can you imagine being so lightweight?",2/3/1986 7:54
1067,497," It would be graet to fly, thats something I can imagine, I bet the dodo bird was a magestic animal",6/6/1988 3:50
1067,497, That depends. Do you consider pigeons majestic? Dodos are actually part of the pigeon family.,8/18/2010 19:49
1067,497," No, not really, but Dodo seem to be a lot different than pigeons, do you know that some birds travel really long distances without sleeping!!",1/6/2003 6:22
1067,1067, Like when they migrate?,11/14/1994 17:24
1067,1067," Yeah exactly, when they migrate from Alska to the northern region of Mexico",6/8/1999 3:13
1067,1067, I'm glad that all birds don't migrate. Think of a 9 foot ostrich flying past in the sky!,9/3/2022 10:00
1068,1068," That would be funny to watch, I like hummingbirds, spiders must hate them!",5/28/2000 2:09
1068,487, Why do you say that?,10/31/1997 4:02
1068,1068," Because hummingbirds steal spiderwebs from them, to construct their own nests, that would make me angry",11/19/1972 2:37
1068,487," Understandably so! There's close to ten thousand different bird species, so those spiders had better look out.",5/14/2008 10:12
1068,1068," They must if they want to keep their webs lol, do you like Linkin Park?",3/18/2006 1:15
1068,487, Can't say that I'm much of a fan. I was sad to hear about Chester though.,3/2/1979 2:30
1068,1068," Yeah that was really sad, maybe the 2001 tour got to him, they played 324 concerts that year alone",5/2/1996 12:28
1068,1068, That's quite the tour. I wonder if all those stops finally took a toll on him.,6/27/2020 22:49
1068,487," I bet they did, all those concerts, drugs and then fame. ",1/21/1986 11:02
1068,1068, Do you like audiobooks?,4/9/1997 0:03
1069,1171," Yes, do you? I enjoy them a lot!",11/7/1999 6:52
1069,1069," I do like them, it saves me a lot of time, I usually listen to one on the way to work, Katharine Graham memoir seems like a good pick",8/13/1978 10:22
1069,1069," Yes, it looks very interesting. I think I will enjoy it. All the cover-ups!",1/18/2021 14:47
1069,1069," I agree, theres a lot of interesting stories in her memoirs, like anecdotes about ''The Post'', ''The Iron Lady'', I might buy it and pick it as my next audiobook",11/10/2006 10:30
1069,1069, Thats good. The Wife Between us sounds like a drama! Would have to be in the mood for that.,3/6/2017 11:47
1069,1069," I like the plot, it seems a bit dark, an abused ex-wife  stalking her former husband, thats an odd couple",6/23/1988 10:56
1069,1069," yes, I like period pieces, so the Revolution of the Moon sounds interesting!",9/30/1973 23:33
1069,1171," That is a great book and Andrea Camilleri is a great author, I like her style,, ",12/20/1992 13:27
1069,1171," Good, I love anything on the solar system, the moon, saturn etc. Do you?",4/4/1981 16:51
1069,1069," I am in love with the moon, its so beautiful, I envy the astronauts that could see earth from up there, a unique landscape indeed",3/27/1995 18:40
1070,676," Agree, So glad Nasa made the right choice putting the US flag and not the UN flag!",8/17/2002 9:06
1070,676," Yeah, after all NASA is American and its our achievement, you know there might be life on Titan",1/31/1980 22:17
1070,1070," I saw that, I think there are other earths out there, so exciting!",3/12/2005 20:12
1070,1070," That is exciting! there must be other moons like ours then, you know that moon dust cuts through kevlar and is extremely harmful to us",7/27/2021 23:39
1070,1070," I know, can't imagine surviving that moon hay fever.Have you road the Jurassic park ride  or jaws?",3/8/1990 15:05
1070,1070," No seems like a scary ride, too much for me, why do you ask?  I bet you have",9/6/1996 17:45
1070,676," Yes, love the rides and the movies. Especially when my kids were little.  Star wars opening soon at Hollywood studios. Do you like the movies?",8/31/1979 14:49
1070,676," I do like Star Wars and also movies one of my favorite directors is Steven Spielberg, he has so much talent",11/1/2006 18:32
1070,1070," Agree, did you play Nintendo? didn't know Bill Nye was a look alike for Steve Martin?",4/13/2012 21:30
1070,676," They look alike thats funny lol, and Yeah I play nintendo I have the original system at home I bought one before they discontinued it back in 2003",3/16/1978 8:57
1071,1071," hi, do you attend concerts?",8/18/2014 21:40
1071,1467," Hi, how are you? Sometimes, when I have the money. How about you?",2/6/2008 8:55
1071,1071," Yeah me too , same here. Do you know Linkin Park?",1/1/2013 9:01
1071,1467," I've heard the name. They're a band, right?",1/29/1984 12:35
1071,1467, Yes a famous one . They held 324 concerts in 2001,2/4/1997 12:31
1071,1467, They must not have slept. I guess it's good to be young!,6/12/1975 17:48
1071,1467," Yeah I guess so. How about Ramones, do you know them?",11/28/1997 2:32
1071,1071," The Ramones are legendary, but I've never seen them live.",9/10/2002 11:45
1071,1071, They have played concerts for 20 years straight,9/25/2001 20:28
1071,1467, I guess they love touring! I would get exhausted!,6/17/2002 10:50
1072,551," Yeah me too, so many concerts though, 2263 of them",12/7/2020 8:57
1072,551, I wonder if anyone follows the band around. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an empty amphitheater. What is that about?,2/9/1972 0:22
1072,551, Yeah I wonder too. A creed concert was so disliked four people sued them,11/28/2001 21:33
1072,1072, They should probably have practiced in front of an empty stadium first.,6/9/2005 21:12
1072,551, Yesh that would be better for them. in crotia there is such a theatre too and I wonder who has played there,6/6/2022 10:40
1072,1072, I don't know if Croatia is a big destination for bands. Maybe Creed could start their tours there.,11/13/1977 23:09
1072,1072, I am not sure either. do you have a favorite instrument?,1/9/1985 13:15
1072,551," Uh, I guess the guitar? What about you?",4/5/1991 19:44
1072,1072, Yeah me too I like it. did you know mercury and mccartney used the same guitar once?,8/1/1994 16:40
1072,551, I think it was the piano. Freddie played the piano.,2/19/1986 7:31
1073,1073," Yeah that is correct, the piano. so cool though, two legends.",6/16/2019 22:30
1073,1073," There must be magic in that piano. Well, I enjoyed chatting!",1/16/2020 12:13
1073,1013, same here.,10/26/2007 8:49
1073,1013, So do you go to a lot of concerts?,7/10/1971 9:55
1073,1073, I actually do!  Love music and going to concerts!  Do you like Linkin Park?  They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.  That's a lot of shows in one year!,10/5/2014 10:42
1073,1073, Yes it is. I don't like them though. I'm more of a country person.,9/19/1996 10:22
1073,1013," Country is good too!  I was never much of a Ramones fan but they toured almost non stop for 20 years playing a total of 2,263 concerts.  That's a crazy high number of shows.",6/10/1983 7:08
1073,1073, Definitely! I've never heard of them though. Did you know that Creed was sued in 2002 because their concert was so bad?,3/15/2014 7:53
1073,1013, I didn't know that!  They must have been really really bad. lol  There's an old ancient Roman amphitheatre in Croatia that's still used as a concert venue.  That would be neat to see.,12/9/2007 12:03
1073,1073, Yes it would. Do you play piano. I love it but can't play it.,7/27/1997 11:53
1074,1074, I like it and tried several times when I was younger but couldn't get the hang of it. In 1930 there was no news worth reporting so the BBC decided to just play piano music instead.,12/23/2002 4:11
1074,562, That is something. I am astonished that someone managed to get a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain lol.,7/21/2011 4:00
1074,562, Wow.  Wondered how in the heck they did that?  I couldn't even imagine taking on that task.  Both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record their hits Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude.  That's kind of neat.,7/10/1972 16:39
1074,562, Yes it is. I love both those songs. I love Paul McCartney on the piano. He can make those keys sing I think. Imagine putting an aluminum grand piano on an airship and it weighing only 356 pounds. Wow!,3/15/2021 7:49
1074,562, That's neat that it was made out aluminum!  I wonder if it was on the Hindenburg when it crashed?,2/8/1994 9:38
1074,562, That's probable. I don't know a lot about the violin but there are definitely a lot of variations of it.,3/4/2009 12:14
1074,1074, Yes.  It country music they call it a fiddle!,1/23/1984 1:21
1074,562, Yes. That's about the only thing I don't like in Country music lol. The music from them just hits me the wrong way.,1/5/1984 0:20
1074,562, It does give it a distinctive sound though.  lol  There is violin that is made out of stone that is playable.,11/24/1987 0:44
1074,1074, Wow! makes you wonder how thats possible. I'm very surprised that Einstein played both the violin and piano. I never knew that.,1/29/1987 1:51
1075,1075," He was a genius.  Joseph Haydn, who was a classical composer, one wrote a piece where the musicians gradually leave the stage until only 2 violins are left.",5/20/2011 16:18
1075,1162, I wonder what that piece is like. And in blind tests modern violins were preferred over million-dollar stradivarius violins when sound tests were blind.,4/2/1971 2:37
1075,1162, That would be hard to tell apart I would think.  Larry Fine from the 3 Stooges burned his arm as a child and took violin lessons to strengthen his arm.,10/21/1982 4:52
1075,1075, That's horrible that that happened. I love the three stooges. It must take a lot of strength in your arms to play that then.,4/6/1985 2:22
1075,1162, I love them to!  I still will try to watch them from time to time just to get a good laugh.,12/9/1983 14:08
1075,1075, Yes I know. My kids don't know what to think about black and white tv shows. I love them though.,1/2/1972 5:31
1075,1162, I think they're still good.  I enjoy the Little Rascals too.  It was nice chatting with you today!,12/5/1991 22:02
1075,1162, Hey there have you ever been to a concert before? I know I go to them all the time,5/13/1996 8:28
1075,1162, Unfortunately I've never been to a concert! I would love to go to one soon.,9/20/2003 1:57
1075,1075," Wow you've never been to a concert? you need to go to one ASAP LOL, maybe go to a The Ramones concert Sunday? Apparently they've been touring for almost 20 years straight, I bet their show is really good",4/16/2005 3:44
1076,1076," That is crazy! My mom really likes them, maybe I'll be able to take her. ",10/5/1988 20:35
1076,1076," Yes you should! She would love it LOL. I would also go to a Linkin Park concert, although I think they're singer passed away, back in 2001 they did like 324 concerts in only a year, that's like one per day almost",7/9/2008 18:05
1076,1076," I grew up listening to Linkin Park and it hurt me when I found out Chester died. That is a lot of concerts, wow. ",11/30/1996 13:29
1076,1076," Yep I agree with you. Would you ever watch a concert in an ancient Roman Amphitheater? Apparently Pink Floyd did a concert there, and there is one in Croatia that still does concerts to this day",9/30/1991 2:00
1076,191," That is insane, I think I would watch it just to experience it. I don't know if you know who Creed is, but apparently they were sued by four concert goers because their 2002 concert was really bad.",8/25/1993 14:43
1076,191," That's pretty funny haha. I would actually be embarrassed if I were them, do you play any instruments by the way? I personally play the piano",6/29/1971 20:18
1076,191," I know right! I don't really play any instruments, I use to play on a piano when I was a kid though.",8/23/2009 7:34
1076,1076," Yeah I play the piano, I start to learn as an adult, I actually like it a lot. I didn't know that back in 1930, there was a day where there was literally no news and so the BBC just played piano music instead haha",10/12/1981 6:56
1076,1076," Oh cool, I'm glad you enjoy it. I'm surprised there was no news, that is crazy.",10/12/2015 18:06
1076,1076," I know right. You would never see that today, they're always coming out with news about something, do you like Queen by the way?",6/10/2011 4:32
1077,1077," Absolutely, he is a legend!",11/27/1993 19:54
1077,1965," I agree with you! Apparently the piano used in Bohemian Rhapsody, is the same one Paul McCartney used for the song Hey Jude, I do like both songs haha what about you",3/7/2005 17:31
1077,1077," I do too, it's really cool to know the same piano was used. If you ever think about climbing a mountain, maybe try Britain's highest mountain, you can play piano up there! ",3/10/2020 23:24
1077,1077," I should do that! And put it on YouTube haha. I wonder how it got up there too, do you know what the Airship Hindenburg was?",9/15/2016 5:32
1077,1077, I have no idea. What is it?,11/27/1980 17:04
1077,1077," It was that giant blimp thing, remember it like exploded in the air, but apparently they had a piano on it and since it had to float, they used aluminum to create the piano, it only weighed 356 lb., I know that a real piano weighs a lot more than that",11/8/2000 22:31
1077,1965," Wow, that is so interesting, I really had no idea that happened! I knew about a violin that was made out of stone, and guess what, it's playable! ",8/10/1978 22:53
1077,1077," That's cool! I always wanted to play the violin, I just heard it's really hard, it makes sense that Albert Einstein would play both the piano and violin haha",2/1/2006 18:51
1077,1965," Hi, how are you? Are you a music fan?",10/6/2013 7:39
1077,1965," I listen to music whenever I can! I haven't been to a concert in a minute, but I tend to really enjoy those when it's an act I'm a fan of. I can appreciate orchestra, too, though.",11/12/2022 4:05
1078,1078," Same, I do like some orchestra stuff like John Williams and the guy who does the Game of Thrones music. Can't say I would ever go to an orchestra festival like Shift though.",6/27/1986 9:37
1078,1078," Festivals can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly. It sounds like Shift was not executed as well as it could have been, even if it was well-intended.",5/13/2012 17:42
1078,1078," I think I haven't been to a concert myself in over 5 years, the last one being the Foo Fighters.",9/29/2018 10:29
1078,1078," I saw REO Speedwagon and Chicago back last summer, and it reminded me that those shows are NOT fun if the music isn't loud. I heard the Foo Fighters played a concert so loud in New Zealand that it registered on seismic monitors!",12/28/1990 2:19
1078,1078," That's awesome! I saw the first Global Citizen concert in Central Park that had Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young. That one was amazing. Huge venue in the park.",8/1/2014 9:43
1078,1742," That sounds fun--I guess that's kind of the ultimate venue for a festival. I was invited to a house concert last month and turned it down because it didn't sound fun, but there's a huge range in the kind of places you can have one. I suppose intimate venues work well for solo performances or ensembles involving instruments like pianos or violins.",9/3/1986 20:36
1078,1078, Have you ever been to cgbg in NYC? The Ramones used to play there back in the day pretty often.,7/25/2001 14:14
1078,1742," I'm familiar with both, but I think I'm too young to have experienced either of those things live haha. ",3/5/1982 9:19
1078,1742," Me too, but I've been to cgbg before it closed down. I imagine the Ramones played a lot of similar punk rock scenes. I think I'm too old for a venue like that now haha.",4/30/1987 19:00
1078,1742," I guess the concerts that take place today aren't really the stuff of legend. For example, in 1972, Deep Purple broke the world record for loudest concert, in which three audience members were rendered unconscious. I can't see that happening today.",1/20/2008 18:47
1079,740, Haha that's crazy. Do you like Creed?,1/16/1976 17:28
1079,740," Oh, God, I remember them being popular back in the day and people not realizing that they were basically Christian rock haha.",7/9/2011 17:49
1079,1079, Haha yeah it was so obvious they were Christian rock even with their hits but it took people a while to catch on. Apparently they were so bad that after one concert they were sued by 4 people who went for it going so poorly lol,9/19/2016 16:43
1079,740, I guess those people really didn't know what was up! Although musicians can be tricky; once Dave Matthews was picked up by an audience member on the way to his own concert when he became stranded riding his bicycle.,3/17/2005 4:53
1079,1079, Haha that's seems like something that would only happen for a Dave Matthews concert. Is Dave Matthews still around?,6/29/2009 15:39
1079,1079," I assume he's still alive--God knows he'd be able to sell out a tour as Gen Xers become nostalgic for the 90s. DMB would make a ton of money, although I'm not sure they'd get a $1 billion offer for 100 reunion concerts like Abba did.",3/19/1974 22:31
1079,1079, Haha what? Abba got offered a 1 billion for 100 reunion concerts? No way. I can't even name one Abba song.,11/12/2016 14:42
1079,1079, They only get played at wedding receptions so the old people have something that they remember haha. I would have taken the money while that audience is still alive! It's probably the other half of the demographic who would go to the Shift classical music festival.,8/24/1989 2:15
1079,1079, Haha! So they didn't take the money?,11/29/1995 1:47
1079,1079," Apparently not, I guess those royalties are still pretty lucrative or they actually hate each other that much. Nice chatting!",6/20/1989 15:23
1080,1753," Festivals are really nice I remember going with my parents when I was a kid, really fun",8/4/1971 12:36
1080,1080, Which festivals did you go to?,6/3/2020 17:01
1080,1080," Just local festivals, I want to go to The Shift festival of American Orchestras, that seems like quite a show",7/7/1996 8:43
1080,1080, Could you tell me more about the Shift Festival? I heard the main focus was creativity,8/24/1970 16:06
1080,1753," I sure can, so 4 American orchestras are playing on the festival, the music is great and presenters a re good as well, all the orchestras are famous and skilled so I can see why the main focus is creativity",2/1/2000 0:02
1080,1753, Who were some of the present artists?,6/27/1972 14:54
1080,1753," National Symphony Orchestra, Albanys Symphony, Fort Worths Symphony and theres even dancers from the texas ballet",2/8/2009 5:52
1080,1080, That sounds like quite the lineup. Do you enjoy going to such events like concerts?,10/17/2020 9:39
1080,1080," It does sound like an interesting lineup, worth every penny, and yeah I like concerts",8/29/1971 8:09
1080,1080, Any in particular you want to or wished you went to?,12/30/2020 22:22
1081,1081," I regret not going to a Linking Park concert, that is one of my favorite bands, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 and I couldnt make it",9/7/2008 17:07
1081,1081, That is a lot of concerts in one year. I wanted to go hear the ramones who toured almost 20 years nonstop with over 2000 concerts under their belt,1/6/2007 14:06
1081,1081," Thats a lot of concerts as well, they must have spent all their time touring, travelling around the world.",8/14/1975 4:55
1081,1081," Ya. Personally as long as it's not a creed concert or heavy metal, I think I would enjoy it",1/27/1976 5:06
1081,494," Yeah I heard Creed had a terrible concert back in 2002, they even got sued because of their poor performance",12/22/1970 12:46
1081,494, And it wasn't even once!,6/30/1983 5:11
1081,1081," 4 concert goers sue the band, you know theres an ancient amphitheatre in Croatia that is used as a concert venue still",3/12/1972 14:44
1081,494, That sure sounds like an amazing place to hold a concert,12/13/1989 3:31
1081,1081," I know right, a lot of history present at the amphitheatre, Pink Floid hold a concert without an audience once",11/10/1977 0:03
1081,494, They did that at the roman amphitheater right? I wonder if just no one came or if they just wanted to play at such an amazing venue for themselves. I know I would,12/3/2017 4:08
1082,1082," Yeah that happened at a roman amphitheater, it was back in the year 1972.",8/9/1976 4:46
1082,640, Hello! How are you tonight?,9/25/2014 23:19
1082,640, Im doing great now that the server is back up. How are you?,7/10/1983 17:35
1082,640, You and me both haha. I'm doing well myself! Have you been to many concerts?,1/13/1983 18:10
1082,1082, i used to go to concerts when i was younger. dont have the time or money now. LOL You?,6/25/1980 0:04
1082,640, Haha same here! What's your favorite one that you remember?,12/11/1980 6:21
1082,640, I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live.,4/15/2014 22:19
1082,640, I bet! Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone?,9/20/1980 1:19
1082,640, I cant imagine having that much energy. they must have slept on the bus. how could they do that?,8/25/1976 14:01
1082,1082, Pure adrenaline probably haha. They could have been like the Ramones touring for 20 straight years. I wonder how many concerts they put on?,1/31/2013 15:38
1083,1083," Probably over 100 a year, so about 2000? ",4/28/1987 3:22
1083,1083, It looks like 2263 in total! You were close! At least they weren't as bas a Creed doing concerts lol.,8/10/1994 23:52
1083,1083, Is Creed a christian rock band? it sounds religious.,8/13/1988 0:42
1083,1083, They were some terrible rock group in the early 2000s. They were sued once for putting on a terrible show!,4/27/2021 3:44
1083,1083," Wow, i guess they should have rehearsed a bit before touring. that is terrible. i wonder if the fans won their suit.",5/11/2005 6:47
1083,517, I hope they did because they were really bad haha. Do you play any instruments?,4/22/2002 2:09
1083,1083, I used to play the guitar. i dont play much now. You?,8/31/1971 8:33
1083,1083, I've been getting into the piano. I didn't realize it's only been around since 1700.,7/19/1993 18:02
1083,517," Yeah, it is a complex instrument. it has a lot of moving parts. ",2/3/1976 3:42
1083,517, I want to see the piano used by both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney sometime! That would be awesome.,12/5/1984 18:53
1084,1512," I bet there is some magic in those keys. You could write a hit song! Anyway, great chat!",11/3/1990 17:13
1084,1084," I hope so lol. Great chat as well, have an awesome night!",11/22/1978 12:08
1084,1084," Good Afternoon!  I love going to concerts, seeing my favorite bands, music live - how about you?",3/7/2002 1:38
1084,1084," Hello, I do as well though I don't get to go often. I have been to a few recitals in my day too.",4/22/1998 5:20
1084,1512," I used to go to shows a lot more that I do now, kids and family will have that affect!  And, I like smaller venues - definitely not areas or stadiums!",6/22/2004 14:23
1084,1084, I prefer smaller settings as well though I would love to attend a concert in an amphitheater. In Croatia there is a roman amphitheater that they still use as a concert venue.,12/26/1989 0:11
1084,1512," Nice!  Europe has so much history and the engineering / architecture was so great, that doesn't surprise me that a venue would still be in use - amazing!",7/28/2015 13:44
1084,1512," True. In 72, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience at all.",12/27/2009 1:18
1084,1512, That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert?,1/28/1974 0:28
1084,1084, Good question. Are you a fan of Creed's music? Four people at one of their concerts in 2002 sued them because it was so bad. Yikes!,11/10/2000 11:46
1085,1085," I am not a Creed fan, or that genre.  So I can totally understand why fans would be disappointed enough to sue - but honestly, what were they expecting?!!?!?!?",12/17/1988 10:17
1085,1085, I guess the opposite of that would be Linkin Park who played 324 concerts just in 2001. They were definitely a success back in the day.,7/31/2002 21:42
1085,1085," Pretty sure I was at at least one of those LP shows in '01.  It's a shame that the lead singer is gone, he was from around here...",7/10/2013 7:44
1085,1085, How cool! Have you heard of the Ramones? Apparently they toured almost 20 years non stop.,12/18/2007 3:18
1085,1085," Of course - a little before my time, but very influential in the Rock/Punk Rock scene.  Ramones kinda started the live rock scene in NYC - or at least were the kings of it for some time",12/24/2008 22:01
1085,1085," Wow, I had never heard of them. Do you play any musical instruments? Piano/violin?",10/24/1970 2:23
1085,1085, I do not - you mentioned that you had been to recitals in the past.  What type of recitals / instruments were featured?,10/13/2015 22:05
1085,1677, I had a few friends who were music majors in college. I attended a lot of piano recitals mainly. Einstein was a musician as well and played the piano and violin very well.,11/21/1996 8:09
1085,1677," Interesting!  I began to enjoy piano composers later in life, not sure why exactly.  Chopin and Vivaldi are some of my favorites!",9/29/1981 23:13
1085,1085, A friend of mine in Cali has a baby grand in her house. They had to use a crane to get it in their house and also remove a whole glass wall on one side of the house. Course not as big as the grand piano built on the airship Hindenburg.,1/21/2009 18:29
1086,1086, Fascinating - they had a grand piano on the Hindenburg?  Maybe that's why she went down!?!?!?,3/22/2016 20:49
1086,1086, Well it was aluminum and only weighed about 356 pounds!!,12/7/2014 17:01
1086,1086," I guess you(me) really do learn something new everyday!  In case this chat ends unexpectedly, it was really great chatting with you today!",10/20/1975 18:20
1086,897," Same here, have a great day!",6/23/2002 18:50
1086,897, Did you know there is a company that has robot dogs for sale?,6/6/2010 12:01
1086,1086, I did not. What's it all about?,8/11/1975 19:41
1086,897, It's Boston Dynamics and the dogs can do things like open doors and empty the dishwasher.,12/5/1976 10:44
1086,1086," Oh, I have heard of a German company that is making a dog like robot  called Spot Mini.",11/26/2021 23:34
1086,1086, Hm. The one I mentioned can haul 30 pounds and may be used to work in dangerous environments like nuclear clean up.,8/18/2021 14:54
1086,897, That would be great! It sounds like Spot Mini that is 66 pounds and 2 feet 9 inches tall.,11/20/2015 0:37
1087,1087, Wow.  I heard it can also move on surfaces that wheeled robots cant.,2/24/1984 4:04
1087,1026, It sounds useful. I've also heard it can haul a 30 pound payload.,4/15/2010 12:46
1087,1087, Yes.  Did you know Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to roam around the desert near Las Vegas?,9/13/1995 15:22
1087,1026," No, I did not!",1/21/1996 3:58
1087,1087, Yeah and robots can be controlled by rat brains?  It will change personalities with the change of brains.  Wowl,5/1/2009 17:29
1087,1026, Wow! I know robot movement is so precise that they can debone a chicken with surgical precision.,12/20/2011 6:44
1087,1087, That precise yet the military uses Xbox controllers to disarm and ID IEDs.  ,12/9/1978 6:20
1087,1087," Really? Wow! I wonder if they learned that skill on Youtube? Especially since users can upload, share, view and rate videos.",6/11/1975 15:02
1087,1087, Probably... Why not?  Police have BluTube to share videos. ,10/6/1973 22:36
1087,1026, I have never heard of that! Do they share law enforcement videos?,2/15/2015 7:59
1088,427, Yep.  Did ya know YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine on the internet?,5/20/2016 16:15
1088,1088, I am not surprised. I know Netflix and Youtube combined make up half of peak internet traffic in north America.,4/19/2021 9:59
1088,1088," Yeah, computers have changed things a lot.  A far cry from 1936 when the Russians built a computer that ran on water.",11/10/1994 5:59
1088,427, I never knew! Gangam style got so many views they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.,3/8/2005 22:29
1088,1088, Hey thanks. You were an excellent chat partner!,12/1/1972 4:11
1088,427," hey there, do you like robots?",6/25/1993 15:28
1088,427," I think they are pretty fascinating, actually the term robotics was invented by scifi writer Issac Asimov.  What about you?",10/22/1977 2:11
1088,1088, Even Michael jackson took deep interest in robots.,7/15/1970 0:33
1088,427," Robots can be made to look human or not, which do you prefer?  I don't really mind them taking human form but in the end they are just machines.",1/1/1970 1:45
1088,427, I know so I am not sure why the need for them to look like humans,10/6/2020 12:59
1089,1080," Apparently Boston Dynamics is making a 4 legged dog robot named SpotMini, so now they are creating a market for pet robots too.",1/28/1970 14:46
1089,1080, cool. they have trained robots to debone a chicekn with surgical precision,6/1/1978 10:10
1089,1089," There are clips on YouTube about SpotMini.  It is a bit special since it is not wheeled it can move across all kinds of terrain,",12/31/2005 16:19
1089,1080, That is so cool maybe I should check it out to see what it is all about,9/2/1989 14:37
1089,1080, That is the joy of computers because we can access all this information.  And now they are controlling all kinds of industrial and consumer devices!,1/25/2016 3:13
1089,1080, True. the us military uses xbox 30  controllers to control theur eod robots,5/27/2018 4:50
1089,1080," That is awesome.  I believe that robotics can help those who are handicapped, for instance a robotic arm a person could control with their thoughts.",7/22/1986 9:41
1089,1089, Exactly. ANd now they make exoskeletons that can help people stand up. so cool,6/29/1970 21:05
1089,1080, The scary part will be when a robot starts to think on its own instead of what has been programmed.  We don't want a real life Megatron!,10/18/1977 12:24
1089,1089, That is true. Do you weatch lots of videos of robst and other on yoututube ?,4/29/1971 8:17
1090,1090, Sometimes I do.  Youtube basically has any topic you can think of.  The very first video was a guy talking about an elephant if you can believe that.,5/1/1989 11:19
1090,1090, And now they have everything in there. it is the largest search engine on the net,5/27/2009 22:22
1090,1235, Well yeah they ended up getting bought by Google in 2006 and added the power of Google's search engine so that make sense for sure.,6/24/1977 10:10
1090,1090, yeah. originally they had a lower view count but were forced to upgarde it after gandnam style song,9/11/1982 11:33
1090,1090," Now all kinds of networks like CBS, BBC and Hulu use it for their content.  But you can always watch Bob Ross instead.",7/30/1996 10:06
1090,1090," I love Bob Ross, what a legend. It was nice chatting with you",1/11/2011 20:53
1090,1090, Do you like fish? ,12/12/1997 13:35
1090,1235," I love fish, looking at them and eating them also",12/13/2003 8:27
1090,1235, Did you know a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck? ,6/6/1974 15:38
1090,1235," that is so interesting, I wonder why they declared that a fish if it is the only one with a neck",8/1/1996 16:18
1091,1905," I'm not sure, what about eels? ",11/23/2018 7:46
1091,1091," Eels are scary, I always remember the little mermaid when I think of eels, lol. What do you think about them?",12/15/1975 19:10
1091,1091, Not much. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal? ,1/16/1990 0:08
1091,1091, I would not want to cross paths with that. I think there has to be something that could kill it.,9/28/1996 23:42
1091,1091," I'm not sure, I don't think that can be real, can it? ",2/22/2011 9:37
1091,1091," I don't think so, maybe I will look it up lol. One thing I wouldnt cross either is the black swallower fish, have you heard of that one?",8/10/1979 23:24
1091,1091," Me either. What about shoes, any interest? ",9/25/1993 20:36
1091,1091," I love my shoes! I like nike mostly, how about you",9/18/1997 1:31
1091,1091," I'm more of an adidas fan, but I have some Nikes. ",5/12/1975 13:59
1091,1091, Did you ever have the stephon marbury shoes back in the day?,10/5/1990 19:11
1092,1092," No, but I had some air jordans? ",5/20/1980 22:51
1092,1092," Nice, I love air jordans. The marbury shoes were sold at Steve and Berrys for like 15 dollars each. They both don't exist anymore",5/21/2020 15:38
1092,1092," Wow, that is pretty cheap, is that on an inflation adjusted basis? ",9/15/1983 17:21
1092,1092," I am sure they are more costly now on ebay since they are so rare. Marbury promoted them when he was a star NBA player and never took a dime to endorse them, pretty cool",9/29/1999 20:45
1092,900," Yeah interesting. Well, I didn't know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986, did you? ",6/24/1994 18:06
1092,1092," I did not know that, that would be some cool clothing to wear, I think I may go check it on ebay. It was so nice chatting with you!",8/18/1986 13:33
1092,1092," Yeah, pretty funny right? Well, nice chatting!",2/15/1978 15:50
1092,1092, Hello.  Did you vote in the mid term election?,8/9/1980 10:31
1092,1092, Hi yes I did. How about you?,5/23/1995 23:04
1092,1092, I did. I think it is very important for all of us to vote.,11/9/1981 22:58
1093,1150, It is important. I also like trivia about politics. Did you know that the senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Richard Nixon cracked it?,6/18/1996 5:54
1093,1150, I heard about it.  Why did Nixon crack the gavel? He was not supposed to use it.,6/24/1984 13:46
1093,1150, I doubt that he did it on purpose. He probably just got carried away. But I'll bet he felt pretty bad.,12/13/1996 7:46
1093,1093," I said earlier that voting is important.  In India, they went even further.  They set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions just to give one person the opportunity to vote.",2/22/1997 2:57
1093,1150, I don't think we would go that far do you?,9/26/1996 12:34
1093,1093," No, I do not think so.  Did you hear about the senate and their candy drawer?  ",11/24/1976 12:31
1093,1150," Yeah, it must be nice. But I guess you have to give some of them free candy just to show up. Look at the Senator they had to drag in by his feet in 1988.",6/26/1975 21:42
1093,1150," Yes, I heard the obscure rule that was invoked by a US senator.  Do you know which senators got arrested and forced to come to the chamber to vote?",5/16/2004 7:44
1093,1150, No,10/21/1973 22:44
1093,1093," Oh, okay.  I accept your explanation.  ",6/4/1981 10:38
1094,1228, Did you know astronauts voted from space. Not surprising when you consider some other voters are lost in space.,2/20/1985 23:17
1094,1094," Yes, I heard.  I don't how how they do it though because they cannot just say it to the people on the ground.",5/6/1995 17:19
1094,1228, That's a good point. Did you hear that Austin Texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst. I wonder what he did?,10/28/1988 7:33
1094,1228, Texans were going to vote.  Did it pass?  I do not know who Fred Durst is or was.  I'm sure it was someone important to Texans.,6/22/2002 16:31
1094,1094, Yes they voted to rename the dump. I'm thinking he must have been a corrupt politician or something. It's not exactly an honor.,7/28/1998 10:57
1094,1094, You are right.  It should not be an honor.  I do not want my name to be on a garbage dump.  I will research further out of curiosity. ,9/18/2014 18:54
1094,1228," I think I will too. Nice chatting with you, have a good night.",5/7/1975 23:35
1094,1228, Nice chatting with you too.,3/29/2020 10:38
1094,1228, Thanks.,7/16/2000 14:47
1094,1094, Hi there did you know that the US Senate used the same gavel for 165 years?,1/15/1974 2:02
1095,922, I think I heard about that! And then one day Richard Nixon broke it LOL he truly is the master in the art of ruining things LOL,2/25/1996 3:31
1095,1095, To Funny! Apparently the Senate set up a rule that the Sargent of Arms could round up missing members and carry them into the Senate chamber. ,9/13/1970 4:43
1095,1095," Wow that's interesting. You know what I want to do though? I want to raid the candy desk that's in the Senate, they have a lot of good stuff like milky Way's and Mars Bars and jelly beans lol those are my favorite",1/7/1996 7:39
1095,1095," Right, haha! It's a shame that women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. At least not until 1993, wow!",2/28/2012 12:08
1095,1095," That is insane! I'm glad that they fix that because that seems really silly, also I like Michael Jordan's quote. he says that he won't endorse a Democratic candidate becauseRepublicans buy shoes toI wish more celebrities would follow in his footsteps",4/2/1991 16:52
1095,922," That's some kind of sentiment, kind of confusing, why not just say he's a Republican, lol!",4/25/1970 2:33
1095,922, Haha that's true. How often do you vote by the way? Did you know that astronauts vote from space?,8/30/1972 16:46
1095,1095," Wow that's pretty cool. The indian Government set up a polling booth in the forest, it was full of lions.",12/3/2010 12:51
1095,922," Well that's cool. And they did that all for just a single voter too! Did you know that in the United Kingdom, not every man could vote until 1918, that's not a long time ago",2/28/1990 21:55
1095,922, Wow i didn't know that. Also a shame that 34% of black males have been permanently unable to vote in Alabama. ,2/14/1973 19:07
1096,1096," I agree that is sad. What makes me laugh though, is that the citizens in Texas voted to rename a garbage dump in Austin toFred Durstthat's definitely a diss on him haha",1/8/2015 12:11
1096,1955, Yeah it is. You know there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a republican or Dem since the mid 1800's.,6/3/2001 20:23
1096,1096," No I didn't know that. I think it would be interesting to have more political parties in the United States though. Another interesting thing, is that every president with a beard has been a republican, I wonder why that is haha",5/12/1985 5:06
1096,1955, Wow no republican has been elected with out a bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928. That sounds oddly weird to me. ,2/5/1997 4:42
1096,1955," That is really weird. Although I think that information is old, because Trump was elected and he's a Republican. What is really crazy to me, is that the red and blue colors for Republicans Democrats only started in the year 2000. That seems like it's been that way my whole life, but apparently not",3/9/1985 16:56
1096,1955, Yeah you would think it's been a lot longer than that. At least to my relocation. ,11/29/2014 13:06
1096,1096," Yep I agree. Do you remember Harry Truman? He was president in 1957, and a Democrat, and so he wouldn't get his picture taken with Dumbo because Dumbos an elephant aka a republican lol",3/4/2000 12:58
1096,1955, How ridiculous! If didn't want a picture with dumbo so what how does at 60-70 years old. haha!,5/8/2008 17:23
1096,1955, Haha I know right! does that mean that a republican shouldn't get a picture with Eeyore because eeyore is a donkey LOL I mean anything is possible now,2/20/2012 5:41
1096,1096, Right! There have been 16 US republican President. Apparently that's the most from any one party. ,3/25/1971 18:00
1097,1026," That is interesting. Also interesting is the evolution of the two parties. it's even crazy that the Republican party started back in 1854, and before that they were known as the Whigs",3/31/2009 4:02
1097,1026,  Did you know Richard Nixon cracked the us senate gavel after being used for 165 years?,8/31/2000 15:07
1097,1026," I was not aware of that, very interesting.  Are you really into politics?",8/12/1971 6:39
1097,1026," just a little, i like to know whats going on",12/1/2009 15:31
1097,1097, i live in Washington dc so its always on ,9/26/1994 17:39
1097,1026," i would not care for that, did you know astronauts vote from space?",2/26/1994 2:59
1097,1097, That is awesome.  I am glad that they have the opportunity.  Do you follow the republican party?,9/25/1978 10:53
1097,1097," yes, every president with a beard has been a republican:)",6/14/1976 21:22
1097,1097," not sure how accurate that is, Trump does not have a beard",12/23/1971 13:10
1097,1097," just meant the ones that have had a beard, it seems like red and blue has been used forever for rep & dems but did you know it only started in 2000?",9/1/2008 12:11
1098,1098, I understand.  I thought the red and blue would have started earlier.  I feel like I have seen it forever.,9/24/2004 13:40
1098,136," same, also only dem or rep president since 1853, time for an independent?",2/8/2011 2:24
1098,1098," I agree with that, they have least funding though",1/9/2021 11:32
1098,136," true, hows this for voting, Indian govt set up poll in a forest with lions",8/8/2001 15:58
1098,1098, that is crazy,6/3/1987 20:01
1098,1098," they had one voter, talk about restricting the votes",8/5/1979 0:27
1098,136, Hardly feels like a majority.  Do you follow the Senate?,11/26/1997 8:47
1098,1098," not so much, i like the idea of the candy desk where they keep a drawer of candy for the senators though",2/25/1970 13:40
1098,1098, I love that idea.  As well as women staging a protest for pants suits.,3/24/1985 13:08
1098,1098," yes, hard to believe they could not wear pants until 1993!",8/16/2011 3:01
1099,1099, Craziness.  Are you registered to vote?,5/2/1978 3:53
1099,1099," yes, i think it is important",6/3/2019 12:03
1099,1099," Me too, a way to make change",4/16/1979 16:53
1099,1099, nice chatting ,7/17/1977 17:10
1099,677, Same to you.,4/15/2014 12:28
1099,677, :),8/10/1992 8:02
1099,677, How does America make collective decisions.  By voting.  ,2/12/2014 6:47
1099,1099, Do you know the difference between the United States Senate and House of Representatives?,6/4/2022 12:21
1099,677, One difference is 2 per state for the Senate while the House has 435 districts.  Those who are elected call the people who are represented constituents,1/22/1971 16:27
1099,1099," Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think.",1/12/1978 1:55
1100,1100, Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.  They used the same gavel for 155 years until Richard Nixon cracked it.,10/31/2018 2:44
1100,1100, The only fun think I've learned about the Senate is that they started the candy desk tradition. I remember my teachers always had candy drawers in their desks.,7/15/2020 2:07
1100,1469, I have one in my office too.  One needs supplements if your blood sugar drops for no good reason.  Apparently Pennsylvania is the source of the candy right now.,11/16/2021 7:16
1100,1100, Was that because of the Hershey factory there? Did you know they let astronauts vote from outer space? I think that's a good thing.,8/8/1984 21:02
1100,1469," The astronaut voting sends a strong message about how important voting is.  I like that too.  For some reason, the candies are Mars bars and Milky Way rather than Hershey.",9/25/1997 23:04
1100,1469, I'd think they'd have expensive candies from local shops. I wonder why the Senate used to have a rule that women were not allowed to wear pants until after 1993?,4/4/1981 11:49
1100,1469, I suspect that women set the dress code in years past so they would look professional. Michael Jordan would not endorse a democrat because republicans buy shoes too,7/12/1992 9:07
1100,1469, I heard that about Jordan but I really didn't understand what he meant. I also don't understand why Republicans started out with ideals more like Democrats today and then switched. ,1/26/1994 17:52
1100,1469, Jordan has his own line of shoes made by Nike.  It is a separate brand and he does not want to offend almost half of the market.  But the GOP has always been small government and low regulations.,4/21/1989 8:57
1100,1100," I get it now! Well, Jordan was smart for that as far as business goes, it seems. It's also interesting to me how the Republicans are associated with red and Democrats with blue.",6/7/1991 4:04
1101,1101, Yes.  I remember one election where one network had those colors reversed.  But the color code is solidly established now.,2/23/1979 8:40
1101,1786," It seems like it's been so since long before 2000, but that's the year it started, I guess. I think it's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed on a Dumbo ride as to not be associated with Republicans.",9/10/2017 8:31
1101,1101, That is amusing.  It is also odd that all Presidents with a beard have been republicans.,2/4/1990 9:15
1101,1101, Do you think a party besides Republican or Democrat will ever actually have a person elected as president like Independent or Green Party?,11/22/1973 17:26
1101,1786," Ha Ha.  I think it is possible that one party will collapse because it is too narrow and a third party will become the second party.  It seems that the democrats are growing, particularly with immigration swelling their ranks, so the GOP is most likely to collapse.",5/8/1996 2:53
1101,1786," Even though I don't fully agree with either major party, it does make more sense if Republicans faded before democrats because they seem to have the most restrictions that keep things fair. Maybe Republican's numbers with the attitude of the strong survive is fading?",7/15/2013 13:49
1101,1101," I understand.  However, I believe in free enterprise which has created the wealth of America.  I am not optimistic that dems will stay on that track.  Too many socialists.  Nice chatting.",3/10/1983 19:55
1101,1101, Do you read much poetry?,9/11/2022 2:13
1101,1786, I do sometimes. What about you though? I do read a lot of old Epic tales like the Epic of Gilgamesh,10/14/1999 17:54
1101,1786, I've never read that one. It sounds fascinating though. I read more classics like the Iliad. ,3/21/2004 0:07
1102,1102, Yes I read that too. They're very interesting I think. We should put more effort to read those kinds of books in our school system,8/26/1971 19:42
1102,1318, I totally agree. Poetry and its word choices and writing structure makes it something that encourages creativity. ,5/15/2005 17:42
1102,1102," Yes and the interesting thing about the word poetry is that it drives from a Greek term, the term is poesis which means making",7/19/2000 16:56
1102,1318, That makes sense since when it comes to poetry you are definitely making something. I don't think it is as appreciated as a writing form as it could be. ,5/17/1986 22:58
1102,1102," Yes I agree. No one really writes poetry anymore. It's interesting how in Javanese, the alphabet will form a phone when it is read in order",8/18/2005 18:00
1102,1102, Oh that's really neat. I love when poems do cool things like that. Like the depressing poem that you are meant to read backwards so it becomes a happy one. ,11/21/1979 9:36
1102,1102, Yes I'll have to check that out. It makes me sad that Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for the poem The Raven that's actually a really amazing poem,6/4/1985 2:43
1102,1318, You would think that his family estate is getting royalties on that. I bet the person that paid him so little was kicking themselves when he became popular. ,7/21/2011 19:46
1102,1102," Yes I agree. Did you hear about the 224 palindrome poem? It was created by Demetri Martin, that sounds interesting",3/27/2003 6:15
1102,1102, 224! That is a huge amount of palindromes. I'm not even sure I can think of that many let alone that many sentences that could be palindromes. Talk about talent. ,9/11/1973 18:24
1103,916, Yes I agree! What do you think about the Sun by the way? It's amazing that the diameter is 109 times that of Earth's diameter that is so huge,10/30/2016 18:56
1103,916, That is really huge! And to think it is still only 1 billionth of the size of the largest star ever seen in our galaxy. Makes you really feel small. ,3/24/1993 14:01
1103,916," Yes I agree. Also I never knew that the sun is actually white, only the atmosphere makes it seem yellow, I wonder why we don't learn at school",12/27/1995 12:21
1103,916, You would think that would be something they would teach. I know that we covered the lightening bolt being hotter than the sun at some point. That is one of the random facts that sticks with you. ,3/14/1997 5:45
1103,1103, Yes that is a surprising fact. Planets are so interesting though. I never knew that Venus didn't tilt and that it also doesn't have any seasons,11/22/2015 3:52
1103,1103, I did not know that. That is way different that uranus which roles because of how much it tilts. ,6/2/2007 22:31
1103,1103, The name Uranus always makes me laugh haha. I wish that we had another planet in our solar system no. Jupiter's moon Ganymede could actually be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun instead of being a moon,11/13/1982 10:48
1103,1103, I miss pluto being considered a planet. It is hard to remember them because we can't use the first letter memory trick anymore. ,9/2/2001 2:08
1103,1103, Do you know much about the US senate?,1/16/1992 7:57
1103,916," A little, I know people are up in arms over Kavanaugh's Supremo Court nomination. ",6/13/1973 23:15
1104,1811, Yes very much so. That was quite the rough battle. Did you know that they had the same gavel for 165 years?,8/12/2015 7:40
1104,1811, I heard that and then old Trick Dick broke it. ,10/16/1992 15:40
1104,1104, Yes he did. Were you also aware that there is a candy desk in the senate?,9/20/1982 0:57
1104,1811, Sounds about right is there anything good any it?,3/13/1974 17:21
1104,1104," Yes, it's supplied with candy from Pennsylvania including milky ways, mars bars, and jelly beans. ",11/15/1992 8:19
1104,1104, Well i guess sometimes you need a snack. Did you know that women until recently could not wear pants on the Senate floor?,2/11/2017 9:45
1104,1104, That's very upsetting. Do you know how recently?,8/20/2021 23:18
1104,1811, It wasn't until 1993 and two women had to be defiant to get their point across. ,3/22/1994 22:56
1104,1104, What?! That's far too recent. I didn't realize sexism quite that blatant was so recent. Very upsetting. ,9/10/1988 22:21
1104,1811, Yes it is. In India the government set the polling booths in the forest full of lions.,12/22/1997 17:32
1105,1739, That's extremely accommodating. I knew that astronauts can vote from space which is also impressive. ,10/26/1990 11:37
1105,1739," Especially when there are so many people who would like to vote but can't, like 34% of black men in Alabama. ",11/8/2008 8:51
1105,1105, That's absolutely horrible and unacceptable. There seems to be a decent amount of suppression going around. ,4/16/1970 1:17
1105,1105," Yeah and it's all unfortunate. Wow apparently Austin Texas doesn't like Fred Durst much. They wanted to name a garbage dump after him,lol.",10/12/2007 23:19
1105,1105, Ha ha! That's hilarious! I wonder if they let them.,12/14/1973 9:29
1105,1739, No president that was a republican did not have a beard. Sounds funny must be including trump. ,10/13/2006 10:21
1105,1105, That's very interesting. How odd. I do know that with the exception of Trump the last time a republican was elected president with no Bush or Nixon on the ticket was 1928!,7/9/1974 13:02
1105,1105, Strange...I didn't know that Mormons were mostly republicans. There have been a total of 19 republican presidents. ,10/3/2018 15:17
1105,1739, I did not know that either. I wonder how many have been Democrats for comparison?,7/15/2018 19:20
1105,1105, Do you happen to own an iPhone?,4/24/1975 3:04
1106,1511, I do.  I dont think Ill ever switch to a Microsoft or any other device,10/8/2022 18:24
1106,1106, I have one as well. Did you know that women are more likely than men to have an iPhone? I wonder why.,8/3/1992 20:52
1106,1106," Im not sure, they probably werent the ones downloading that game send me to heaven and launching them into the air.",8/31/2005 23:39
1106,1106, Ha ha maybe. Have you heard of the band Muse?,9/3/2006 20:44
1106,1511," Cant say that I have, what do they do?",1/29/1997 18:13
1106,1106, Kind of pop rock. Matt Bellamy of Muse recorded his unborn son's heartbeat with his iPhone and used it on a song recording. ,8/28/1991 13:16
1106,1106," That is pretty neat.  It is certainly a huge part of our society today, I am glad it has developed from the first versions where Jobs had to switch it out because it kept crashing.",7/18/2000 2:33
1106,1511, That's so embarrassing. I hope he pulled it off. Microsoft held an iPhone funeral when they released their phones. That was presumptuous.  ,10/26/2004 8:47
1106,1511," Very much so, I bet apple just laughed.  Apple's electronics are far superior, in my opinion.  Their clothing line from 1986, likely not.",7/16/1986 17:32
1106,1106," Wow! I don't remember that venture. That was a bad idea. Speaking of clothing, did you know that the pilgrims were colorful clothing?",11/18/1999 10:51
1107,1107," I had heard that, but I guess i just remember the white and black from all the history books, or rather the illustrations and descriptions.  ",9/22/1981 7:37
1107,1107, They always depicted it that way but they only wore black for special occasions. ,10/20/2005 23:07
1107,1900," I wonder why they always were depicted like that, I mean color is so much more fun.",6/22/1991 21:13
1107,1900, That's a very good question. There is a store in Alabama that only sells clothing and items found in unclaimed baggage. ,1/31/1998 7:04
1107,1900, It must be like a high end thrift shop.  I often wondered what happened to all of those clothes.,6/14/2019 19:03
1107,1900, I think it would be interesting to visit. This is off topic but do you know much about the white house?,7/3/1977 19:46
1107,1107," I know some odds and ends, like they still use floppy disks for storing files.  I didnt even know they made floppy disks anymore.",6/24/2016 18:54
1107,1900, I didn't either. I have not seen one of those in forever. Did you know that the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France? I wonder why they decided to do that?,5/28/1999 11:03
1107,1107," It also seems like twin buildings could pose a security threat, unless those are equally secure.",6/17/1982 19:33
1107,1900, I agree but i am unaware of whether they are there for aesthetics or function. ,4/11/2014 23:53
1108,265," Hi, how are you? What do you know about the White House?",6/23/1982 16:41
1108,265, I know that there are identical versions of it in Ireland and France,3/7/1970 5:54
1108,265, That makes sense. The US has had close relationships with those countries for years.,6/26/1975 11:57
1108,1108, Their versions probably don't still use floppy disks for storing like ours does partially,8/14/1988 18:16
1108,265, I wonder if that is for security purposes. Strangely outdated tech. Hm.,5/18/2003 16:53
1108,1108," That was my guess too. I find it interesting how many times the White House has undergone renovations. The West Wing wasn't created until 1901, and it was expanded only eight years after that",2/21/1994 13:47
1108,265," It was a modest residence. The guest house is bigger, I hear. I wonder when that was built.",7/14/2021 2:46
1108,1108," Who knows? I'm surprised Trump hasn't made any changes to the White House. Solar panels were put on the back by George W. Bush, and I've heard that's not the first time they've attempted solar power",8/26/2009 19:51
1108,1108, Carter put them on first. Oil shock and that. Reagan removed them. Clinton did nothing.,11/14/2004 6:21
1108,1108, At least none of them banned Christmas trees like Teddy Roosevelt did,11/9/1989 15:47
1109,1109, Teddy was a conservationist. He did like destroying nature. Unless they were animals with heads for trophies.,7/24/1997 22:09
1109,1109, Think he made clothing from fur? I wouldn't be surprised if he did,8/30/1977 7:56
1109,1109, He probably did. I guess he thought he was being manly by killing wild animals. Seems senseless. There are other ways to prove your toughness.,5/1/2018 8:45
1109,1109," True, though I'm sure it was good insulation in the winter",7/15/1998 11:20
1109,1837," Yes, that's true. He was an interesting guy. Larger than life.",5/11/1980 10:53
1109,1837," I wonder if he would have had an iPhone if he lived in this decade. Women are more likely to own them than men, but maybe he would have preferred Apple",7/19/1996 20:08
1109,1109, I think he would have hated technology like that. He was an outdoorsman. ,4/6/1971 13:13
1109,1109, He might have tried the game Send me to heaven by throwing his into the air. He wouldn't have minded a shattered phone if he won,2/3/2003 7:22
1109,1837," LOL. Probably not. Anyway, thanks for the chat!",7/29/2013 8:55
1109,1109," He definitely wouldn't have bought anything from Apple's clothing line. Yes, good chat!",4/25/1988 9:09
1110,1110, True. Apple clothing? LOL,9/27/1992 17:50
1110,1742, It was a thing back in the 80s. It likely died in the 80s as well,9/27/2002 14:38
1110,1110, hi how are you today? what do you think of shoes?,9/8/1992 15:43
1110,1742, I think shoes are very valuable.,12/15/2004 19:01
1110,1110, Can you relax with your shoes? John Candy couldn't. he had to take them off. boy his dogs were barking! I usually wear shoes myself.,1/7/1990 19:18
1110,1742, I probably wear my boots more than shoes.,1/1/1992 4:35
1110,1110, do you wear your boots to bed? i had a friend who did that. he was worried that someone would break into his house and he would have to fight them. he didnt want bare feet.,4/5/1985 15:28
1110,1742, I usually dont wear them to bed. Unless I am really tired and just pass out.,4/6/1971 19:23
1110,1742, i guess i would wear my shoes to bed if i lived in a bad neighborhood and had to fight burglars or raccoons. ,8/22/2014 21:06
1110,1742, That kind of sounds a little bit insane to me to ber honest.,7/28/2017 9:00
1111,1931," yes, but in bad neighborhoods sometimes people break into your place and you might need to confront them. you want your shoes on then. clothing would be good too.",7/28/2011 1:35
1111,1111, Yeah I guess your right. did you know there are 17 ways to tie your shoes.,2/24/2009 12:48
1111,1931," i wonder which one is best for fighting burglars and raccoons and other vermin. i think that it should be a practical knot that can be tied quickly, just before combat.",9/25/2015 2:22
1111,1111, I think as long a it keeps your shoe on your foot and is quickto tie it would be best.,3/3/2017 5:18
1111,1931," yes, burglars can be pretty quick, so you need to stay on your toes when it comes to tying your shoes. ",4/22/2021 6:50
1111,1111, That certainly is true.,7/5/1995 16:46
1111,1111, i knew that you would agree. i have made a rational case for bed shoes to go with my bed clothes. dont ever worry about burglars again. you have your bed shoes and a knot in the laces that will stay tied in a fight.,11/30/2000 1:34
1111,1111, You could just use velcro,3/8/1978 5:26
1111,1111," velcro *is* speedy, ill grant you that one. but will it hold, especially in the heat of domestic combat? that is for someone else to test in the field, not me, oh boy, i made that mistake before. ",4/23/2019 15:09
1111,1931, Lol. Well be sure to get your idea patented like Bill nye did.,11/4/1992 2:45
1112,1112, Bill Nye. now that man could tie a shoe. he is a scientist. he know how to make things stick.,9/11/2007 9:26
1112,1491, I know right. He patented som ballet slippers. I think he could do better.,5/14/1997 9:27
1112,1112," never misunderestimate good old Bill. anyway, great chat. i gotta go change muh shoes.",9/18/1990 17:29
1112,1112, bye bye,11/19/1990 1:13
1112,1112, Hello,12/2/1995 0:38
1112,1491, Hey. Did you ever get jealous of the kinds of clothes your friends had when you were a kid?,4/15/2010 13:40
1112,1491," I totally did!  They were just bragging today about shoes  apparently they go on feet to comfort and protect them.  Bunch of snobs, I think.",8/7/1996 13:08
1112,1112," I remember wanting the trendier clothes my friends wore, and once or twice getting made fun of for wearing hand me downs.",5/2/2018 4:57
1112,1491, I hear ya there.  One of my friends is wanting to do a clothing line for fish.  I keep telling her that fresh water fish drink through their skin via osmosis.,11/15/1996 12:57
1112,1112," That sounds more complicated than my aunt buying clothes for her dog! Some fish drink water via their mouths, but the ones that soak it in through their skin would need clothes that wouldn't block that.",2/25/2021 17:47
1113,1113, This is so true.  I think that's why I like Jack Purcell canvas shoes.  The dog never gets them dirty when we go for a walk.,12/6/1976 6:15
1113,1500, I wonder if dogs ever get jealous of other dogs with clothes. Can dogs even make fun of each other like kids or adults sometimes do?,7/14/1995 2:35
1113,1500," I'm sure they do.  If crows understand economics, trade and barter, then dogs pretty much have to understand jealousy.",3/28/1993 1:12
1113,1500, Hopefully that won't lead to anything like the coat ban in some schools to try to stop kids from teasing others for their clothing quality. Can you imagine being banned from the dog park because your dog's Jack Purcells are too nice?,4/19/1991 6:07
1113,1113," You have a good point, but my dog only wears Patagonia, so I'm not too worried.",4/8/1981 3:09
1113,1500," I didn't know Patagonia made dog clothes too! They have really nice human coats (that's funny to write), and they're usually less expensive than some designer brands. Some of those get up to $955 or more!",3/25/2020 4:47
1113,1500, I know!  Moncler coats cost more than my first car did.  ,5/25/2012 8:16
1113,1500," I don't think I've ever spent more than $40 on a coat, but I have a hard time not being cheap about clothes, plus I live in the desert where I don't need them much! I've never bought anything like a Moncler.",4/11/1988 3:13
1113,1500, Poverty Shaming seems like it would take so much energy.   You always have to try and be original or it just starts to turn into a meme,3/9/1995 18:50
1113,1113," It's really sad how petty or troubled of a person you have to be to do it too. People put down others because they haven't learned to pick themselves up any other way, and it's indicative of deeper problems.",1/25/2006 1:06
1114,1114, Oh totally!  They would be better off spending their time buying clothes for their dog.,11/13/1992 19:44
1114,1968, Maybe people should be more like dogs sometimes. Dogs aren't going to make fun of other dogs for not having smartphones or nice coats like people do.,6/4/2016 9:50
1114,1968," You do make a really valid point, but dogs also eat burritos off the ground, so it's a trade off really.",3/8/1996 15:06
1114,1114," On the other hand, dogs don't waste food that way! It's a money-saving method that I don't know if I have the stomach to adopt.",11/19/1998 17:27
1114,1114," Alright, you're right!  Dogs should be more like people!",2/9/1991 8:31
1114,1114," hello,  do you vote?  did you know Indian government puts their polling booth in a forst full of lions?  That is crazy!!",7/21/2014 13:55
1114,1114," That sure is crazy and yes, I do vote. DO you? Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space",6/7/1986 5:52
1114,1968, Every vote counts lol ,9/29/1993 18:54
1114,1968, It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918,5/26/1993 9:56
1114,1968, Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years!,4/19/1999 9:28
1115,1115, Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that,6/28/2008 10:32
1115,250," haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel. ",12/26/1992 21:27
1115,1115, Maybe. In Alabama sadly a large portion of the male balck population cannot vote,4/26/1974 17:25
1115,1115," Wow,  permanently too.  I wonder if thats due to people in jail?  Maybe?",1/18/1990 10:55
1115,1115, I think that is what it is. On the other hand in Texas seems people are more interested in voting to change the name of the garbage dump,5/11/2006 7:41
1115,1115," That seems so dumb to me,  are there not more important things to vote on?  Also,  that is so negative towards that person,  arent we voting to make things better,  for positve outcomes.  ",7/13/1988 17:56
1115,1115, Yeah go figure. In Senate women were not allowed to wear pants until lately,1/13/2019 9:31
1115,250, Yikes they must have been cold!  I wonder why the topic of women wearing pants is such a big deal in that time. ,8/20/2001 19:25
1115,1115," Well, it is about equality and they must have opposed it until those two senators decided to protest by wearing pants. Good for them",1/11/1971 1:50
1115,1115," Heres a fun fact,  Every us pres who had a beard was republican lol ",10/3/1977 15:22
1116,1570, Cool. And we have either had a republican and democrat president since 1853,12/25/1976 3:22
1116,1116, Yeah thats interesting!  Looks like Truman refused to take a pic with Dumbo when he was at Disneyland so it wouldnt be associated with republicans.  Why does dumbo related to republicans?  do you know?,2/14/2006 15:19
1116,1116, Yeah the Republican logo is an elephant and Dumbo is a baby elephant so I guess he did not want to be associated with that,3/21/1990 17:05
1116,1116, Oh wow lol But its just Disneyland lol ,10/14/1995 7:28
1116,1570, I know right? Go figure. Did you know both parties adopted the blue and red as late as 2000,7/7/2000 8:53
1116,1116," Yeah,   i thought that had been around forever lol I guess not.  Have a good one! ",9/18/2022 23:39
1116,1116," Do you take much interest in the first lady, now or in the past?",1/24/1982 10:30
1116,1570," Some, I always try to pay attention to whats going on in the world.",9/17/1994 12:23
1116,1570," I always feel that the first lady is in position by chance, not act.  I know people like to know what they are wearing and stuff, but it seems trivial to me.",5/6/1987 12:04
1116,1116," Very true, but no matter what they must conduct themselves with dignity, and their past all of a sudden becomes more in the public eye.  I never care who/what/where people wear.  Id rather see their actions.",4/18/2011 8:40
1117,1117," The first lady is damned if they do and damned if they don't, get involved in policy that is.",2/1/2020 3:23
1117,1576, It is sadly true.  Supposedly Melania wore a Jacket saying I dont care.  Do U to the boarder separated children,6/28/1976 15:30
1117,1117," Probably not the best choice, but I'd hate it if every choice I made was monitored by hundreds of people every day.",10/10/2019 21:27
1117,1576," Very true, It is hard to make any statement without a certain base of people hating on it.",10/22/2017 0:14
1117,1576, The thing now that everyone has iphones and can take pictures of you every second of the day.,9/21/2005 3:18
1117,1576," That does make things so much harder.  In the past, you might have to worry about some secret cameras, but mainly only got photographed  at big events.  Now it can be at the store.",5/23/1972 23:22
1117,1117," The only place they can escape the constant media is in the White House, or any other private residence they may have.",4/12/2011 18:33
1117,1117, Very true.  If they did sneak photos they might catch her using floppy disks.  The white house still uses thos for storage,10/31/1981 15:36
1117,1117," That would be scandal, they'd accuse her of being a technophobe. In the days of iphones I thought floppy disks would be non existent.",11/1/1970 23:58
1117,1576, It really would.  A laughable one at that.,10/27/2019 15:07
1118,1590," At least they are advanced enough to have solar panels on the building, Bush put them back after Reagan took them off.",11/29/1981 15:48
1118,1118," I heard that, I wonder why Reagan took them off.  Solar is such a great benefit!",2/16/2006 20:53
1118,1118, Probably making a political point.  usually everything Presidents do is to make a point.  Can't see any other reason.  Unless the reflection was getting in his eyes.,4/24/2004 5:28
1118,1118," True, It was like good old Teddy banning Christmas trees, because he was a conservationist!",12/11/2006 6:35
1118,1590," It makes sense if that is your belief.  Can you imagine the uproar now if a President did it today, the media would be full of their assault on Christmas and Christianity.",9/10/2001 14:59
1118,1118," It would, unfortunately.  People just read into a situation only what they want to see.",10/7/2017 13:03
1118,1590," Well I need to go and get some clothing on, have a good day.",9/5/1977 18:45
1118,1118, Same here.  You as well!,5/19/1971 1:31

1118,1590," Hi,kind of how about you?",3/28/2013 22:40
1119,1119," Same here, but only recently. Did you know astronauts can vote from space?",11/15/2001 22:10
1119,1119," I didn't know, that' cool. I know that a chimpanzee received 400,000 votes in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. ",12/10/1974 21:00
1119,599, Haha He would have my vote too! I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918!,10/10/2012 21:12
1119,1119, haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes.,3/2/1994 23:48
1119,599, I believe it! I wonder what Canadian politics is like. I wonder if they used the same gavel as long as the US senate did?,4/20/1997 19:46
1119,599, I'm not sure.do yo know that JFK voted against the 1957 civil rights act.,3/11/1991 3:19
1119,599," And he was a democrat wasn't he? Crazy! He didn't have a beard so he had to be, since every president with a beard were Republicans!",1/21/2011 8:49
1119,1119," not necessarily, at some point Hilary Clinton was the president of young republication in college. I wonder what made her change her political party. ",11/30/2013 17:27
1119,599," Very interesting! Harry Truman was so anti republican that even at disneyland, he refused to be pictured on Dumbo!",6/3/1978 2:37
1119,599, interesting. He was selected to be the vice president under Roosevelt because he was able to expose corruption and he saved the government $10-$15  billion when he ran the senate Truman committee.,4/26/2021 12:03
1120,1120, That's one way to get into the office! I didn't know we only associated colors with the parties as late as 2000!,3/1/1982 16:40
1120,1120, Really? I didn't know either. but yeah some did a really great job like Strom Thurmond. he holds the record for the longest filibuster by a lone senator because stayed on the senate floor speaking for more than 24 hours non stop.,3/30/1988 7:48
1120,329, I remember hearing about that! I would have been sitting at the candy desk during that one!,9/9/2022 4:01
1120,1120," Haha that's funny, in 2000 40% of Alabamas voted to keep a ban on interracial marriages. what did you think about that?",10/31/1988 20:46
1120,1120, I think they all need to lose their right to vote! I think it's funny that Austin TX citizens voted to rename their dump Fred Durst.,10/11/1981 16:37
1120,1120," Fred Durst, the singer? that's kind of weird. ",5/4/2015 22:16
1120,329, Yes probably because they think his music was garbage lol. Voting is just a cool thing people do. India even set up a polling station in the jungle for a single voter.,1/9/1997 4:13
1120,329, haha that's kind of funny and I feel bad for that voter.,4/13/2000 23:53
1120,329," He or she had a fun time finding it I'm sure. Well it was great chatting, have a good night!",6/15/2019 9:41

1121,1821, Hello!  Do you like fish?,1/11/1991 16:33
1121,1121, I do like fish. Do you?,12/12/2003 11:00
1121,1121, I've always like them since I was a kid.  Did you know that freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via Osmosis?,3/19/2021 23:52
1121,1121, I had no idea. How do salt water fish do it then?,9/27/1970 13:07
1121,1821, They ironically drink through their mouths.  Weird.  ,1/21/1995 9:47
1121,1821, Yeah. The black swallower fish seems legit. And also has a big stomach!,5/28/1974 8:24
1121,1821, That must be why it can eat prey twice it's own weight and 10 times it's weight?  ,12/20/2020 7:35
1121,1821, 10 times its weight is crazy! I weigh 245 and cannot imagine eating something that weighs 2450 pounds!,11/13/1999 8:02
1121,1121, LOL  Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to not have a neck?,4/29/1978 1:49
1122,1122, No but I do rememebr seeing a cartoon with Aquaman using the seahorse like a regular horse and it made me happy and laugh!,6/5/2018 19:17
1122,1311, That's right! lol  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  That's kind of neat.,7/25/2013 14:47
1122,1122, I would like to know his secret! Maybe not immortal but give me until 125...,2/27/2010 6:12
1122,1311, I hear you there!  I hear people say they don't want to live long all the time.  I'm the opposite.  I would love to live to a long time.  There must be some immortality in shoes as they say 5000 year old shoes perfom better than modern shoes.,6/8/1995 23:33
1122,1311, That's some old shoes! I will get a pension in a few years and I want to live a long time to build wealth!,7/19/1983 22:44
1122,1311, lol Speaking of shoes.  My feet stink really bad and they make my shoes smelly.  Do you know how I can get rid of the smell in my stinky shoes?  lol,1/13/1975 8:47
1122,1122, HAHAHA... A really self-depricating transition but I appreciate the work! Either tea bags of trash can...,12/24/2006 10:17
1122,1311, Nice!  I will have to try that before I get a rash or something. hahaha  Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?,5/4/1983 13:10
1122,1122, I wonder how much ballet shoes are? That seems really expensive.,11/5/2011 20:36
1122,1122, I'm not sure.  But that's what I was thinking as well.  They must get paid pretty good or the ballet companies must buy them.,8/3/1985 11:34
1123,1123, Are there shoe contract in ballet like in basketball?,2/7/1994 17:48
1123,907, I'm not sure.  Be curious to find out.  I have to get going.  It's been a pleasure chatting with you!  Hope you have a good day.  I have smelly shoes to take care of!  LOL,5/25/1973 10:07
1123,907," Hello, my good friend! How are you doing today on this fine fine day?",7/25/1975 17:37
1123,1123, Hi very good thanks. It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's!,10/2/1976 18:36
1123,907," The Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good.",12/21/1993 14:19
1123,1123, Yeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats.,12/18/2018 22:10
1123,1123, I think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters. They want other options but there are none.,8/28/1989 6:00
1123,1123, True. That whole categorization didn't start until 2000 surprisingly.,10/8/1993 4:20
1123,907, I think that the polarization of politics came with the Bush/Gore election. I am not happy that it has not changed. Now we need for independents. ,5/23/2018 2:40
1123,907, Yes I agree with you there. Interestingly every president with a beard has been a republican!,7/25/2019 8:54
1124,1124," I think that the beard conveys wisdom, the deep wisdom that comes from age. I think that the republicans want to look like Lincoln.",11/9/1999 17:51
1124,1578, Yes good point. In the pas they used animals to associate with parties. Truman took that very seriously.,10/22/2000 19:19
1124,1578, I think that Truman knew that the elephant was his mortal enemy and could not be trusted. Even at Disneyland. He knew the impact of media.,10/16/1993 10:37
1124,1124, True. He just didn't want to be associated with Republicans!,2/28/2016 17:36
1124,1578," I think that he was smart. The Republicans were probably trying to set him up. They laid a cunning trap, but he was too smart for those ",12/25/2000 2:09
1124,1578, Yeah Truman was a smart guy like you say. After the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the southern states became more reupublican.,2/4/1982 23:27
1124,1124," Yes, the voting issue made many people in the South angry. They did not want the change so they went to the other party, the one with the beards.",7/14/1972 18:37
1124,1124, Haha the beard party yes. Interesting that the GOP used to endorse values of classical liberalism.,12/30/1975 14:35
1124,1124," That is the odd thing about the name. It is liberalism from Europe, not the liberalism of the socialists. I do not understand politics. The confusion seems intentional.",5/31/2006 0:39
1124,1124, Yes it would be so nice if there were simpler terms. The Senate also confuses me. It is the more prestigious body than the House of Representatives. ,6/7/2009 2:29
1125,541, There are fewer Senators and they have 6 year terms. They are special in politics.,5/20/2002 5:15
1125,1125, Interesting. The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President!,7/23/2002 4:08
1125,1125," Yes, the VP has power to cast a deciding vote if there is a tie. ",12/6/2020 15:04
1125,541, Wow so much power. The senate once used the same gavel for 165 years!,9/16/1980 21:29
1125,1125, do you like jazz music?,8/13/1984 11:50

1127,1127, Did you listen to Led Zeppelin?  There's a new book out about them.  ,4/28/1998 18:03
1127,1127, I was not aware of that. Have you heard it?,2/15/1991 10:07
1127,211, It's a book.  They do have many good albums.  I remember Houses of the Holy the most. ,6/7/2001 11:35
1127,211, I know they were hugely popular. They were a bit before my time. I do kind of like stairway to Heaven.,5/10/1986 22:11
1127,1127, That song got sooooo much airplay and some their best didn't.  This last book actually is actually from the remaining 3 members.,10/2/2019 20:29
1128,1128, I enjoy books like that. It is interesting to get insight into great bands.,8/17/2011 18:29
1128,1363, This one may be good.  It has a diverse set of photos from all kinds of sources.  ,3/29/2002 9:15
1128,1128, Very cool. Have you ever tried to play the guitar?,1/13/1972 14:07
1128,1363, I tried but I wanted to play well immediately and it made my finders hurt.  I'm no Jimmy Page... ,6/7/2012 23:56
1128,1363, I tried to learn many years ago. I just didn't have the patience. My daughter has taught herself the ukulele.,4/23/2008 14:10
1128,1128, No patience here either... The guitarist from Queen uses coins for pick. Maybe that would have helped...,8/8/2021 5:49

1128,1363," Growing up I was a little indifferent to Queen, but now I really like a lot of their stuff. Which band do you think is beater, Queen or Led Zeppelin?",8/29/2017 6:54
1128,1128, Different styles but I'd go with Led Zeppelin since they were more prolific. They named the song Black Dog after a dog that hung around the studio.,1/20/1982 22:25
1129,1129," Yeah, That is interesting. I guess naming a song can be a challenge.",2/16/2021 4:50
1129,887, Naming software is the same way... I'm surprised that Led Zeppelin helped fund Monty Python's The Holy Grail... Classic...,8/14/2017 11:36
1129,1129, That is also interesting. Have you seen The Holy Grail lately?,7/31/1984 10:52
1129,1129," It's been a while... I've seen it many times.  Funny, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992!",10/11/1987 17:30
1129,887, I prefer to watch that in scenes because the whole movie is a bit boring. Could you imagine raping when you are 100?,10/7/2002 6:21

1132,585," Uh-huh. True.  New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.  In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands were the prominent style.",11/12/1986 2:41

1133,556," Yes, and even more interesting is that there's a programming language where programs are written in musical composition and function with jazz-like harmonies.",2/27/1995 8:05
1133,1133, That's very nice to know! Great chatting with you!,3/26/2019 13:37
1133,556, Do you like jazz ?,6/5/2019 5:06
1133,1133," Hello there, I sure do, it's such an expressive form of music.  How about you?",3/10/2000 21:36
1134,7," I like jazz, especially cool jazz. ",11/1/2013 13:36
1134,7, Do you know where jazz first originated?,7/23/1997 11:53
1134,1134," I guess the United States, but I don't know where in the US, do you ?",3/16/2011 4:27
1134,7, Yeah you are right!  It was way down south in New Orleans!  Back in the late 19th and early 20th c. ,11/10/2004 13:13
1134,7, Oh so New Orleans music could be considered as Jazz ? It is very upbeat. Do you like that style of music ?,11/5/1970 3:23
1134,7," Yeah I would definitely say that it would be jazz!  I really like that style myself, how about you?  Have you ever visited New Orleans?",5/12/1981 22:43
1134,1134," No never, is it worth it ? It seems that every city has its style of jazz even Kansas City.  ",6/1/2021 21:23
1134,7," That is very true, Kansas city jazz is much more hard-swinging and bluesy, so cool how different regions have different styles. ",8/14/1993 14:25
1134,1134, Do you think gypsies have anything to do with Gypsy Jazz ? I have never heard of any gypsies communities on US soil. ,10/15/1998 21:32
1134,7," I am not sure, that sounds more like an eastern european type jazz with the musette waltzes, very interesting though. ",1/27/1985 15:47
1135,1135," But I a more interested in challenging jazz styles, the less dance-able the better it is for me. ",11/19/1996 17:48
1135,935," Interesting, did you know that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is super popular?",10/13/1988 11:32
1135,935," Yes, I have heard of it,  if jazz is new to them, they have 100 years of jazz music to play to their audience. ",5/15/2019 0:18
1135,1135," That is true, there also is a women in Harlem who has been hosting free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years, wonder how her neighbors all feel about it?",5/24/2012 22:50
1135,935," Yeah, and it is a weekly think, I tolerate a party once or twice per year, but every week, I would start to complain. And you what do you think about this ?",9/13/2018 2:58
1135,935," I think that they all must really like jazz and like her, because 20 years of every sunday is a crazy amount of jazz concerts to hold!",8/29/1973 0:33
1135,935," It must be on the lease of the neighbors, must love jazz. And not be afraid of people with goatee. ",5/10/1982 9:09
1135,1135," Lol, good call!  Yeah I was very surprised to read that those goatees started as a functional thing, not just looking cool. ",2/17/2014 12:25
1135,1135," I wonder how they found this, was it a guy who had already a goatee and did not complain or a guy that complained a lot and grew a goatee in last resort. ",8/27/1992 23:23
1135,1135," Lol, hey that's like the chicken and the egg thing.  Anyways, it's been fun talking with you, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",2/27/1996 7:56
1136,1136, DO you enjoy jazz,1/18/2014 1:35
1136,1136, Love it! How 'bout yourself?,4/7/2000 17:15
1136,697," I also love it, its a genre with a lot of history and interesting roots, all the way back to th 19th century",12/4/1983 11:12
1136,697, Doesn't come from african roots type music?,1/25/1981 5:24
1136,697," Yeah in the late 19th century, in communities of New Orlans, such a great genre, relaxing and nice to listen at",10/1/1997 10:49
1136,697, Did you know Clint Eastwood is a huge Jazz fan?,6/25/1985 1:35
1136,697," No, I didnt know that, I always liked him as an actor, didnt thought he was a Jazz fan as well",9/20/1970 15:23
1136,697, Plays jazz too. Also plays the piano and scores movies.,2/13/1991 14:56
1136,697," Talented guy, what are your thoughts on the goatees some of the pleyers grow?",12/15/1977 14:20
1136,1136,  I like them. kinda sets them apart from other musicians. 1970's was the era for jazz.,5/14/1986 15:05
1137,221," It surely does, its characteristic of the genre, apparently they grow them for comfort",9/9/2014 10:03
1137,1137, I could see that. Especially with a sax leaning on your chin all the time!,2/2/1976 14:35
1137,221," Yeah, the hairs can reduce the frictioin and help them, Pakistan has a great jazz orchestra maybe they all have goatees",9/4/2007 4:40
1137,221, wouldn't that be something to see! Have you ever met a celeb?,3/1/2014 15:37
1137,221," Only soccer players other than that no, what about you?",5/26/1982 8:53
1137,1137, I saw Bill clinton from a distance once. I also swear I saw tiger woods one time too! Pixar studios has a secret room just for celebs.,1/27/2001 16:49
1137,221," That room must be awesome, I wonder who has access to that room, maybe Robin Williams did",8/13/1987 17:38
1137,1137, Maybe Judge Judy?,5/11/1991 2:33
1137,221," She is one of the highest paid celebrities so yeah, that would makes sense, ",5/6/1984 21:28
1137,1137, I wonder if Carol Burnett ever got to see it?,12/25/2011 19:46
1138,1441," Another top celebrity so yeah, that would make sense, I bet she did. ",4/2/1973 7:09
1138,1138, Hello! How are you?,3/3/1978 13:56
1138,1441, I'm great! Do you like Led zeppelin? ,2/19/2016 16:28
1138,1138, I do! I didn't know they were formed in 1968 though! Do you?,7/8/2011 4:33
1138,1138, I listen to them every now and again. Did you know they partially funded monty python and the holy grail?,11/22/2014 0:25
1138,1138, I didn't know that! That's awesome though! Do you know how Black dog got its name for a song?,6/8/1995 6:16
1138,1138," It appears there was a dog wandering around the studio! Interesting, I never knew that! Speaking of recording songs, NWAs straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without a major tour.",6/4/2001 15:33
1138,1441, That is so cool. That means it was really good haha. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century?,1/9/1985 14:09
1138,1441, That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess.,10/5/1998 3:01
1138,1138," Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release!",11/1/1990 21:40
1139,1139, That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch.,10/23/1981 6:49
1139,699, Well at least they could remember how the songs went haha. That is crazy how that could happen!,4/20/1973 7:01
1139,1139," Yeah, that really sucks.When eddie van halen recorded the solo for beat it he set the speakers on fire!",10/6/2016 4:07
1139,699, That would have been a sight to see lol. He must have been rocking hard!,3/22/1979 0:54
1139,1139," Yeah, that would have been insane! Queen's guitarist has a Ph.D. in astrophysics! ",1/12/2007 19:14
1139,1139, He looks smart haha. He uses coins as guitar picks too. That must take talent!,4/5/1972 4:33
1139,699," Yeah, he's a pretty interesting guy. Pink Floyd turned a house boat into a floating recording studio! ",4/18/2013 15:13
1139,699, I wonder how that would be on the drums lol.,3/6/1978 3:54
1139,1139, Muse's guitarist holds a record for most smashed guitars on tour!,7/26/1995 10:20

1140,1140, Thanks! Have a good one!,6/12/1985 16:55
1140,1140," Hey, did you hear about the Disney fans who got married in June? ",5/29/1993 4:12
1140,1140, No I did not.  But I am a huge Disney fan.  Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film dubbed into ZULU.  That was for it's African release.,8/5/1980 12:12
1140,1665," Really? No, I didn't know about that. Did you know that Wreck-It-Ralph was took three decades to create?",9/6/1989 15:52
1140,1665," Really, no, I did not know that.  That is crazy.  I did know that Frozen was directed by a women.  It was the first animated Disney film to do so.",10/9/2009 18:29
1140,1140, That is awesome! Hopefully she didn't use any recycled frames from other Disney movies.,2/23/2008 17:22
1140,1665," I was glad to hear that.  Also, the toy industry gets involved very early with Disney movies.  Usually before the film even begins production.",12/30/2019 22:46
1140,1140, I bet. Did you hear about Mrs. Lambert? She passed away a few years ago. ,12/15/1992 7:01
1140,1665," No, I did not here about that.  But I am a huge animal fan.  Did you know that dogs can have 1 of 12 different blood types?",7/5/1987 20:43
1141,1141," Yeah, I did. I also heard that there are actually dog blood drives.",10/17/2006 5:35
1141,1141," I heard that also.  That is great.  Dogs can see color, just not as many as humans can.  A lot of people think they are color blind but are not.",8/4/2006 6:46
1141,1141, That's good. Dogs are pretty amazing. I especially love how they are attuned to human behavior.  ,8/27/2019 6:02
1141,754, I wish the US was like Istanbul.  They have a vending machine for dogs that will release food and water for the strays in the city in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. ,9/14/1996 1:40
1141,1141," That would be great. Maybe since Google is a dog company, they'll start something like that. ",6/20/1992 18:43
1141,1141, I am more of a cat person.  I have 5 indoor cats.  I remember reading that Google actually says in there code of conduct that they are a dog company.  ,8/26/2005 5:00
1141,754, I don't really like cats. ,4/3/1978 21:54
1141,754," We are DONE talking, lol.  Speaking of hockey, Canada scored 132 goals and only let in 3 during the entire 1924 winter olympic games.  That was the first Winter Olympics by the way.",9/1/1971 7:41
1141,754, Lol. Did you know that an ice hockey rink can be found under basketball courts. They just leave it there when stadium sports change. ,11/19/2005 19:53
1141,754," Yes, I did now that.  Honestly, my wife and I were talking about that last night.  She didn't know that.  Also, baseball may be American's national sport, but Canada is the only country with two, Lacrosse and Ice Hockey.",12/15/1990 16:17
1142,1142," Maybe I should start playing hockey. If I became a professional, I could lose up to 8 pounds in a single game.",10/4/2003 10:54
1142,1142," May, I need to play that also.  A hockey player that went on to win 4 Stanley cups was traded in 1993 for $1.  That is crazy.  Someone is kicking themselves.",7/7/1989 18:17
1142,1142," They have to be. I have to go, great chatting with you. ",7/13/1992 16:19
1142,1959, Same to you.  Happy New Year.,6/17/1979 20:16
1142,1959, did you know that a hockey player can lose up to eight pounds over the course of one game,10/8/1977 2:25
1142,1142," Hi! No I didn't know that, are you a hockey fan?",11/15/1989 9:42
1142,1959," kind of, I'm watching the superbowl right now though haha, I guess Canada's national sports are both hockey and lacrosse, I would have thought it was just hockey",3/31/1979 1:34
1142,1959," Ahah 100%, and that is weird yeah I would've thought it's just hockey by far. It's obviously much bigger in Canada than here though. I know the U.S. Olympic Women's team lost to a New England high school team once.",8/24/1987 19:17
1142,1959," ya Canada is really good, I guess one year at the Olympics they scored 132 goals and only let in 3!",1/17/2010 18:19
1142,1959, God I can't imagine the other team's disappointment. That must be how Bulgaria felt when their women's team lost to Slovakia 82-0.  ,8/27/2018 8:40
1143,1143," that is crazy, are you a dog or a cat person?",6/15/1996 4:22
1143,312," I'm definitely more of a dog person, and yourself?",6/2/2018 1:29
1143,1143," yes I like dogs a lot more, did you know that Google is officially a pro-dog company? haha",5/21/1991 23:13
1143,312," Wow, I wonder how they even chose that! Although it makes sense, dogs are intelligent, they can actually learn over 1000 words!",6/8/2001 11:38
1143,1143," wow that is wild, did you know that dogs have over 12 different blood types?",6/8/1998 5:38
1143,312," Definitely more complex than humans all of a sudden. They can also be just like us though, some dogs have even learnt how to use the subway.",10/2/2003 16:42
1143,1143," ya they're so smart, also I always thought that dogs were colorblind, but they actually just can't see as many colors as a person can",9/2/2003 5:21
1143,1143," That's interesting, dogs are certainly more than we give credit to. Dogs even have eureka moments, just like we do!",1/21/1997 4:17
1143,1143," that is crazy! also, only dogs and elephants respond and understand pointing, no other animals do!",4/17/2003 6:15
1143,312," Haha I guess elephants are intelligent too! On another note, are you a Disney movie fan?",6/14/2012 20:17
1144,1144," yes I am, one of my favorite movies is Dumbo, speaking of elephants haha",1/5/2017 9:29
1144,1144," Right on cue haha. Disney values their older films like Dumbo a lot, they actually used a special camera to make those films more realistic.",1/12/2019 4:13
1144,1144, wow I didn't know that I guess the movie Frozen was the first disney movie to be directed by a female,4/30/1999 10:30
1144,1144," That's surprising, you'd think a huge company would be more progressive. Maybe they value celebrity stars more, the original vultures in the jungle book were actually supposed to be voiced by the Beatles.",9/10/2016 6:48
1144,46, wow that would have been cool! did you know that the lion king was dubbed into zulu for its release?,2/16/2007 15:46
1144,1144, Are you a fan of Disney films?,1/22/1993 5:24
1144,46," yes,definitely i like Disney film ",2/23/2011 15:18
1144,1144, Glad to hear it. Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for it's African release?,5/23/2005 5:35
1144,46," Yes i know a little bit this film Directed by Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff. With Matthew Broderick is it right.",5/29/2009 10:38
1144,46," I'm honestly not sure who directed it. I was quite young when it came out. The main character was Simba, a lion. Speaking of directors, did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. ",5/14/1982 6:49
1145,1145," yes,Frozen, for which she earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Lee is the first female director",4/9/2020 6:59
1145,1145, Yes that is correct. I'm glad to see that they did that but sad that it took them so long. I see a lot of Disney toys. Did you also know that the toy industry gets involved in Disney films before the beginning of the film's production?,10/12/1996 18:48
1145,1145, I don't know about it please explain the details,2/22/2000 14:23
1145,1136, They prepare to make toys before the movie has even began filming. I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie. ,9/28/2020 7:58
1145,1136, I also think about it.,9/17/1981 22:04
1145,1145," Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies. I am going to have to look out for those. ",4/24/1977 9:55
1145,1145," okay,do you like dog?",1/24/2018 21:17
1145,1136, I do like dogs. I also like cats. I like all animals really ha ha. ,1/28/2021 13:58
1145,1145, Do you have them at home?,3/22/2004 1:34
1145,1145, I have cats. I had dogs growing up but we have a lot of stray cats around my home and we took a couple in so now we are out of pet space. ,11/7/1975 19:26
1146,1146," okay,how do you feel about hockey?",5/18/1971 0:16
1146,1146, I don't mind hockey. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports and they are hockey and lacrosse. ,4/27/1981 0:38
1146,1886," i like hockey,The referee supervises the game, calls the penalties, determines if goals are scored and handles faceoffs at center ice at the start of each period.",7/15/1995 10:50
1146,1146, It is very action oriented. It certainly moves quickly. Did you know that if they switch between a hockey rink and a basketball court that the hockey rink remains under the basketball court? I thought they completely swapped them out. ,7/29/2018 16:13
1146,1886, sorry i don't know about it,12/14/2014 9:22
1146,1146, I didn't either. ,7/31/2005 5:38
1146,1146," Hello, what do you think about Lane Lambert and the peculiar day of the wedding?",5/23/2019 7:28
1146,1146," That is a bit different, I guess his daughter ate Lucky Charms out of the cup during this thing. ",1/8/1997 0:23
1146,1146," I think there was a lot of support in social media, from both sides of the family and that is just great!",8/16/1979 5:21
1146,1886, Yeah I can support that myself.  Are you a big hockey fan in general?,3/24/2000 1:17
1147,1147," I do like hockey, you know ice hockey rings are actually basketball courts when they are not in use!",1/10/1999 1:11
1147,1147," Yeah isn't that so interesting, I have seen time lapse videos before of them being changed and its so cool. ",6/4/2007 7:13
1147,1153," I agree, its a nice thing to watch, you know there was a player that was traded for $1 and then won four Stanely Cups! isnt that crazy! Someone definetely got fired over that decision",8/4/2011 19:37
1147,1153," Yeah imagine the scout and guy in charge of making that decision, I'm sure they didn't last. ",9/7/1998 5:21
1147,1153," Yeah, hockey sure is a hard game to play, you know that a player can lose 8 punds per game",6/12/1985 17:53
1147,1153," Wow, that is a ton, but I guess they wear a lot of gear and don't stop moving around the whole game when they are on the ice. ",8/31/2004 8:47
1147,1147," Its a demanding game for sure, you have to be in a good physical shape, there are many types of hockey, thats I fact I didnt know about",7/9/1986 0:47
1147,1147," Yeah I guess our hockey isn't the most popular version around the world, I din't know that. ",11/23/1996 14:57
1147,1147," Yeah apparently bandy, field and ice hockey are 3 of them and apparently there are more versions of the game",7/10/1979 11:13
1147,1153," Really interesting, do you have any idea of what kind of hockey bandy is?  And did you know Canada is the only country with 2 national sports, hockey being one of them. ",4/30/2021 18:38
1148,1014," I have no idea either,  I guess thats why they have a pretty good hockey team, I heard the Canadian olympic team of 1924 was a great team",1/19/2021 23:49
1148,1148," Yeah I heard that as well, I think they only gave up three goals the whole tournament! ",9/5/2005 15:09
1148,1148," Yeah and they score more than 130, that is a humilliating loss for the other team",6/23/1981 7:36
1148,1148, Oh yeah the other teams all got humiliated sounds like.  Do you know if the first winter games was in Canada?,3/19/1972 6:09
1148,1014," I do not know that although its something worth googleling, I think its an interesting fact to know,",11/29/2001 20:51
1148,1148," Whoops, I hate when I do that.  Do you have a favorite hockey team?",6/14/2005 21:07
1148,1014," I dont have a favorite team, I like to watch the game and support the US team but thats about it.",8/16/2021 5:58
1148,1148, are you a Henry David Thoreau fan?,8/24/1983 14:28
1148,1014," No, I had never heard of him.",7/10/2011 17:30
1148,1014, he won a novel about neirology was a Nationa Book Award,7/26/1971 21:47
1149,1149, I thought it was rather odd that he considered a chestnut tree as having feelings.,8/25/2003 19:11
1149,1149, yes totally - very odd but maybe wanting the Earth to have a true 'voice' through his books?,4/23/2007 21:22
1149,1149, That is a possibility. He seems like a very intelligent man.,1/5/2002 18:32
1149,1149, He was an amazing writer and his novels really changed American literature. ,4/27/2007 15:46
1149,1186, I've never been much for reading other than college text books and professional books (for my profession).,1/30/1971 5:46
1149,1186, what profession? does that get boring?,3/20/2022 16:41
1149,1149, I'm a teacher. It's always changing so never gets boring.,3/1/2021 10:12
1149,1186, maybe throreaus writing is too existential or too advance for your classroom?,8/9/2013 0:13
1149,1186, Oh absolutely. It's too existential and too advance for my simple mind as well.,8/13/1983 11:24
1149,1149, what grade are your kids?,7/2/1995 11:33
1150,1150, 3 to 5,1/5/1971 3:13
1150,1182, oh lol -yes you need Dr Seuss ha ha ha!,11/24/2020 11:26
1150,1182," lol, well thankfully we're reading things such as Because of Winn Dixie and The Whipping Boy.",12/16/1982 5:32
1150,1182, I love love love Because of Winn Dixie!!! Do you ever discuss Earth and how it's the only planet to house life?,12/7/1999 3:22
1150,1150, Yes! That was the part of all of the information that I could relate to. We've been studying the solar system.,4/10/1989 22:07
1150,1182, Oh how sweet - that's a great age to start talking about the Earth axis and rotation (spin) using a basketball and fun stuff!,3/25/1970 6:31
1150,1150, I can totally see how Jupiter saves Earth from so many asteroids.,10/31/2018 17:00
1150,1182, How?!?!/,10/4/2019 9:43
1150,1150, It is the largest planet with so many rings. I can picture it spinning slapping asteroids back the way they came.,5/4/2013 1:17
1150,1182, That's a great visual - and I guess probably true! Our earth has so many issue now with climate control and losing forests. ,6/9/2010 10:46
1151,1874, I agree. It's an ever changing earth so everything else is changing too.,10/4/2012 4:11
1151,1151, yes everything is ever changing - don't know that it can be linked to just one thing. ,12/6/2015 10:31
1151,1151, You could fit all the planets in between earth and the moon and still have room left over to spare. Now that's interesting!,6/2/2016 20:05
1151,1874, that is fascinating!   and the fact that 70% of earth is still covered with water / oceans.  So much to explore,6/26/1989 17:38
1151,1874," It is. However, I'm not one who would want to go to outer space or question the universe. I appreciate it as an amazing mystery.",7/5/1993 21:00
1151,1874, I agree - there are some things that don't need answers or to be explored but just to be seen as is and enjoyed. ,5/21/1985 11:14
1151,1151," I absolutely agree. As for AI, I'm not sure how I feel.",11/21/1980 6:05
1151,1874, it's been great talking to you!  Merry Christmas!,7/17/2005 14:50
1151,1874, The same to you!,3/9/1985 20:04
1151,1151, have  great rest of the day!,7/27/1982 9:44
1152,1152, I recently learned that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system.  I wonder if that helps it to support all of the water on it.,11/3/1986 18:35
1152,1094, That is one possibility. Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth.,7/21/1983 12:11
1152,1094, Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface.,7/10/1972 12:32
1152,1152, That is true although I am not much into the science of earth. However I do appreciate the facts about the environment. ,2/15/2011 4:04
1152,1094, Do you like planets in general?  Have you seen or noticed the five planets in the sky at night that can be seen by looking at them?,9/28/1987 10:59
1152,1094, I like planets. And yes I have been able to see them when they are noticeable. I love It when I can see the stars so bright and clear. It's a shame that there aren't so many areas where you can see them due to Earth's atmosphere being affected. ,10/16/1987 4:05
1152,1152, I agree with you on that.  It's extremely unfortunate that more than 80% of our planet's forests have been destroyed.,6/23/1984 14:57
1152,1094, It is very devastating. Hard to believe that so many years ago there was so many trees and other living creatures we can't even see alive today anymore.,3/25/1988 1:17
1152,1152," I know.  It makes me wonder what the planet was really like originally.  I know scientists say that in the beginning a day was on just over 5 hours long but I'm not sure they can actually know that.  So, I still wonder what all happened here long ago and what life was like.",11/4/1983 18:02
1152,1152, Yeah I know what you mean. It doesn't seem logical that it was only 5 hour days. Although if they believe that then their time table of billions of years is very flawed. ,4/17/1974 17:37
1153,1555, Good point!  What do you think about all of the helium going to be gone from the planet by the end of the century?,7/7/1997 3:28
1153,1555, I am a littler concerned because who knows how it will affect the planet. I mean Helium is used for a few things. For all we know it may even affect gravity somewhat. ,10/4/2016 1:02
1153,1555, You're absolutely right.  We don't know exactly what will happen.  It may cause us to lose other things.  The steady depletion of the helium will probably create problems as we go along.,1/27/1985 22:42
1153,1555, It most likely will. I also wonder why the Helium is depleting so much and why it will be completely gone. I mean it just makes me think as to why this resource is really going down.,6/1/2008 19:08
1153,1555," I hadn't thought about that the reason why it is.  That is interesting to consider.  I mean, is it because of forest depletion or something else?",3/30/2000 21:38
1153,1555," It could be because of forest depletion or it could be because of all the pollution. Plus with the billions of people, resources are being taken and hardly being created. ",11/27/2010 18:19
1153,1555," I wonder if it's a chain of life sort of thing too. I mean, if an animal becomes extinct that can change the population of another animal species and so on.  Could it be that elements have that kind of effect on each other?  If so, what did the planet lose that is causing helium to go away?",4/22/1999 2:13
1153,1153, That is a lot to think about and to consider. I mean our planet Earth took a huge change in environment during the era of factories and iron and metal industry taking off.,8/16/1978 18:22
1153,1555, Yes it did and now it will change with artificial intelligence.  As machines become more intelligent and there are more of them I wonder what that will do to the environment.,8/30/2004 19:15
1153,1153, Artifical Intelligence is definitely something that is on the rise. I have seen videos of robots cooking food. The possibilities of robots does make one think life could be easier but at what cost?,8/11/2008 4:35
1154,1154, How far will they go too?  Facebook is trying to develop one that can understand emotions.,12/26/1998 23:50
1154,1792, Do you like to read?,6/9/1998 2:14
1154,1792, I do like to read. Mostly mystery thrillers and sci-fi. How bout yourself?,10/21/2003 22:04
1154,1154," I do, mostly non fiction books, there are also great books about trees, they might sound boring but they can be really interesting",2/8/1972 5:42
1154,1792, I don't know if I could ever just read about about trees. I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating.,1/2/2000 15:43
1154,1154," I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold",5/24/2022 7:29
1154,1154, I like to think about everything we don't know. Like astronomers possibly detecting building blocks for life in a planetary system 455 light-years away.,6/28/2010 16:47
1154,1792," I think thats a real possibility and waht about that planet that has glass precipitation, hostile planet",7/21/2019 17:36
1154,1154, It's so mysterious. And everything we see when we look is how what we are seeing was millions of years ago. It just takes the info that long to get to us. Who know what they are like now.,10/2/1982 3:48
1154,1154," Yeah, maybe a lot more different, we wont be alive to find that out though, ",8/30/1975 0:16
1155,382, Nope. I'm kind of hoping we develop AI further soon and maybe that expedites how we are able to see and travel through the universe,11/1/2006 4:49
1155,1155," I hope that too, AI can be the sollution to many problems",3/22/2007 5:22
1155,1155," AI is really an interesting topic that should discussed more in politics. It's going to open up so many possibilities, but it will also lead to a large loss of employment and could even be dangerous.",3/18/2022 13:41
1155,382," It can, it can surely affect the economy, dangerous in many ways, ",8/3/1976 7:33
1155,1155, Just throwing some ideas out there - we may either have to come with a universal basic income. Or the AI will just get rid of a bunch of us lol,2/2/1978 14:06
1155,382," Yeah like in the movies, AI can beat our brains they even crushed all human records on a game called the puzle game 2048",9/21/1978 15:22
1155,1155," Yeah, Chess and Go as well. Did you see the movie Ex Machina?",4/19/1985 7:55
1155,1155," I didnt, whats it about?",8/13/1984 1:17
1155,382, It's about this guy who wins a developer competition and gets to spend a weekend with the CEO on this remote island. It turns out the guy was meant to be the human component for the CEO's AI testing.,8/14/2021 19:49
1155,382," Interesting plot I have to watch that one, did you hear about Facebook and the AI the company is developing?",9/23/2021 2:29
1156,1766," Yes, kind of scary isn't it. It's like Zuckerberg is building a catalog of all of us through AI and what we post on Facebook",8/24/2001 16:07
1156,1156," It is scary, the AI will understand emotions, identify objects and predict actions, ",10/4/2006 23:08
1156,1156," Hi, how are you?",5/17/1983 13:23
1156,1156, Not bad.    Do you know anything about Henry David Thoreau?,8/16/1999 9:28
1156,1766," I know a bit about him, he is a environmentalist I believe, right?",3/7/1983 9:27
1156,1766," Yes, but he was also an author.    Lots of others were inspired by his example.",10/15/1987 5:26
1156,1766," I get his point though, I mean 80% of the earth's forests have been destroyed already",11/26/1973 23:37
1156,1766," Speaking of the earth, how old is the planet?",8/10/2005 22:43
1156,1766," As far as I know, I think about 4.5 billion years ago",5/25/1993 11:06
1156,1766, That is a long time ago.    How much of the surface of the planet is water?,7/10/2001 1:51
1157,1157," I believe it is about 71%, I was always told 3/4ths when I was younger",7/5/2005 15:48
1157,1456, That makes sense.     Do you know what the core is made from?,7/22/1987 12:57
1157,1157," It is essentially iron and heat, so hot most of it is liquid, and that is what causes volcano eruptions",3/11/1991 7:48
1157,1456, Interesting.     Did you know the earth is quite a bit more dense than the sun!,5/27/1992 9:11
1157,1456," I did not know that actually, but I guess it kinda makes sense since the sun is mostly gas",12/10/2015 3:44
1157,1456, I know there are some other names people call our planet.    Do you know any of them?,5/16/2002 19:02
1157,1456," No, I am not too familiar, what other names do people call it?",2/11/2017 12:05
1157,1456," I've heard of GAIA and Tellus, but there probably others.",5/20/2018 9:52
1157,1157," That is interesting, is GAIA an acronym?",4/9/1982 5:40
1157,1456," No, I think it is from mythology.     Do you know why no mission to Jupiter is possible?",4/6/1995 20:29
1158,1390," No, why is that? I know it has a huge moon though",2/7/2015 13:24
1158,1390," Something about radiation, but that may just be something I heard.",5/20/1976 2:36
1158,1158," Huh, we luckily we will probably never need to inhabit it at least",12/17/2011 4:52
1158,1390, How ya doing? Have you heard of the author Henry Thoreau? His novel about trees sounds exciting.,6/24/1982 8:58
1158,1390, Yeah it does... who would of thought a book about trees could be interesting?!,5/5/1984 23:13
1158,1390, Yeah my thoughts indeed. I love trees and nature. It's a shame that more than 80% of our forests have been destroyed.,7/15/1974 2:13
1158,1158, Yeah i agree... i really hate when they build developments they chop down all the trees leaving none! :(,6/30/1973 8:39
1158,1390, Yeah so sad. Earth is always changing. By the end of this century it will be helium free!,10/18/1986 5:07
1158,1390, That's weird that the hudson bay area in canada has less gravity?,2/25/1993 8:41
1158,1390, Oh I didn't know that. What is crazy is that a day used to be only 5.5 hours when the earth was first formed.,5/5/1985 7:30
1159,1159, WOW... could you imagine?  LOL,5/12/2020 22:53
1159,1159, No that would change a lot for sure! I love looking at the stars too. Astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 light years away!,4/11/1982 3:12
1159,874, Really... how is it possible to see and collect data from that far away?,2/2/1972 5:32
1159,874, Yeah I would like to know that myself. There is even a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph! Sounds like a  warzone over there!,5/11/1975 7:31
1159,1159, OUCH!  The universe is really an amazing place!,9/14/1986 6:38
1159,874, Yes it is. Uranus actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun instead of spinning!,5/26/1990 2:48
1159,1159, Hmmmmm... i wonder why?  Is it really a planet or just a giant rock?,11/19/1981 10:26
1159,1159, Yeah I would like to ask an astronomer that. Do you like AI? It is becoming so smart these days. Stanford has free AI classes to learn more.,12/6/1995 2:17
1159,874, Oh really... AI is really cool!  I want to take those classes!,12/13/1988 13:39
1159,874, Yeah it would be worth it. Facebook is even developing AI tools!,8/9/1980 15:01
1160,1873, I am sure they are... to further steal our information i'm sure!,9/28/2010 18:28
1160,1873," Haha yes. Mark Zuckerberg needs to learn some things about privacy. They are apparently designing it to learn more about user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict user actions.",1/18/1972 1:36
1160,1873, That stuff is interesting and scary at the same time!,9/14/2002 19:14
1160,1873," Agreed. AI is also crushing all human records solving puzzles as well, which would be expected. Have a good weekend!",2/21/2010 0:14
1160,1873, Hello! Do you like lady gaga?,10/20/1973 12:39
1160,1873, Yeah I think she is fascinating. The movie she did with Bradley Cooper was great.,8/26/1987 18:26
1160,1160," I haven't seen it, but I do like that song from it! Her name came from the predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady! Interesting! ",4/19/1977 9:54
1160,1160, Very interesting. A star is born is good you should watch it. It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.,11/9/2004 20:59
1160,1160," I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that!",6/4/1995 9:29
1160,1873, I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter.,6/6/1984 15:33
1161,1217, That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once!,1/5/2021 4:58
1161,1217, Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close.,2/8/1997 16:43
1161,1217, I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous. ,10/12/1998 15:30
1161,1217, Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days.,4/23/2007 15:26
1161,1161," Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics! ",3/27/2013 14:04
1161,1217," Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks.",7/9/2009 22:27
1161,1217," I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems! The guitarist for muse hold a world record for most guitars smashed on a tour! ",4/3/2019 17:43
1161,1161, Yes I recommend that movie as well. Wow that must be a lot. Eddie Van Halen set a studio speaker on fire once!,3/22/2017 0:41
1161,1161, That's crazy! Pink floyd turned a grand houseboat into a floating recording studio. That sounds awesome!,2/7/1986 22:26
1161,1217, That sounds very awesome. I bet the river Thames has never seen such a party!,5/3/2012 17:37
1162,64, I bet! Linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.They must be busy people!,7/7/2006 12:52
1162,1162, Wow very busy indeed. It must be nice to have such a successful debut album.,3/3/1992 1:50
1162,1162," Yeah, they were pretty popular in the early 2000s. The ramones have played a total of 2263 concerts!",3/9/1986 0:52
1162,1162, That is also a lot of concerts. I like going to concerts but the loud amplified sound of the electric guitar is very deafening. Thanks for talking with me this afternoon.,12/10/2011 19:25
1162,64," Yeah, it can get pretty loud! It was nice chatting with you!",2/8/2007 12:53
1162,64, Have a great afternoon. Bye!,11/26/1973 0:04
1162,1162, Are you a fan of Lady Gaga? ,7/23/2004 16:14
1162,64, I am!  I've been a fan since her EP The Fame Monster came out in 2009.,12/27/1977 21:05
1162,1162, Did you know her favorite band is Iron Maiden? ,5/20/1997 1:02
1162,1162, I didn't know that.  How interesting!  Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother!,1/3/1983 15:04
1163,1163, That is pretty cool. Did you know her name came from a predictive text glitch? ,1/19/1977 19:36
1163,1163, I didn't know that.  She was on MTV's boiling points before she was famous.,8/1/1977 4:37
1163,1163," Yeah, that I did know. Or I knew she was on TV. ",7/18/1997 13:24
1163,155, The LAPD asked Lady Gaga to tweet her 11.4 million followers information about some upcoming roadwork. lol,12/27/1991 15:45
1163,155, Interesting. Ever seen Linkin Park in concert? ,5/24/2007 17:14
1163,155, I never have but wish I did.,9/7/1975 20:28
1163,1163, Apparently they played 324 concerts in 2001. ,5/22/1977 21:08
1163,1163, That's a lot of shows in one year!  Probably due to the success of their debut album.,7/28/1995 16:24
1163,155, That it is. It is sad what happened to Chester though. ,5/2/2002 7:00
1163,155," I agree.  Depression is a terrible thing that doesn't get the attention it deserves.  I feel bad for those people who suffer from it.  In Croatia, there is an ancient Roman amphiteathre that is still used as a concert venue.",5/18/2011 22:16
1164,1535, Interesting. I wonder what it looks like? ,12/3/2021 1:00
1164,1535, I bet it's pretty neat looking.  In 1972 Pink Floyd ironically recorded a live concert at a ancient Roman amphitheatre in Pompeii with no audience!,3/28/1988 18:38
1164,1164," Interesting, I'm not a huge fan of Pink Floyd. ",6/11/2008 15:48
1164,1535," I never was either.  In 2002, Creed played a concert that was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  That must have been a really bad show. lol",1/29/1984 3:35
1164,1164," Yeah, they must have really been terrible. Kind of funny when you think about it. I never listened to much Creed. Well, nice chatting with you!",8/6/1970 16:55
1164,1164, Did you know that Queen's Brian May has a phd in astrophysics?  Impressive!  Nice chatting with you too!,6/17/1978 4:34
1164,1535," I actually did. He was also very inventive on guitar. Well, nice chatting with you too!",9/20/2014 16:04
1164,1535, Have you seen the movie a star is born yet?,8/27/1979 20:55
1164,1535, I have. It was wonderful. Bradley Cooper did a wonderful job playing the part.,3/25/1980 23:03
1164,1164, What did you think of the drugs and alcohol in the opening scene,9/21/2009 18:01
1165,1577, I thought that it was a great way to catch viewers attention and it also set the stage for what was to come. ,1/15/2001 15:55
1165,1577, What did you think of Lady Gaga in it? This was her first major picture,3/22/1981 15:07
1165,1577," Lady Gaga did well. When she went onstage for the first performance, her voice was hard to ignore.",12/14/1972 16:01
1165,1165, She does have an amazing voice. I really felt like their chemistry was good for this film as well,11/5/1996 3:12
1165,1165, It was. It seemed like she was learning from him. Did you think that there were any choppy patches during the film?,4/7/2014 9:09
1165,1577, I felt like her own backstory was rushed and not put together well,2/17/2000 20:42
1165,1165," Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani, I did not know that.",5/21/2005 10:31
1165,1577, Oh I did! I am quite a fan of her actually I love her poker face song and her crazy artistic clothing,12/29/2017 2:57
1165,1577," She is definitely an artist of her own. She once bought $1000 worth of pizza for fans waiting in line for her, what a nice gesture!",6/12/1985 18:01
1165,1577, I did not know that! She really does love her fans though! ,10/12/1996 20:50
1166,1166," She was also on MTV's show boiling points before she was famous, I think that is interesting. ",2/23/1992 13:14
1166,452, Wow what is that I have never even heard of it! You seem to know a lot of personal knowledge about her! that is awesome,7/5/1991 21:19
1166,452, It would be awesome if they somehow did a sequel to the movie.,7/23/1990 17:28
1166,1166, I do not think that will happen. I am not sure how they could progress the story into that. What do you think it would look like?,2/21/1980 4:45
1166,452," I don't know what it would look like. I just liked the movie so much. Bradly Cooper played the part of a washed up boy so hard, which I thought would be challenging for him.",1/15/1970 16:16
1166,1166, I know! He is so clean cut in real life that his ability to fill that roll caught me off guard!,10/17/1995 16:38
1166,452, I often wonder if there is truth behind stars having to take pills or alcohol to make it through a concert like in the movie.,10/8/1980 16:55
1166,1166, I think a lot of rock stars become overwhelmed with the fame. I can't imagine it is easy to have no privacy and so much demand on a person so I think it does happen a lot,1/17/2014 1:01
1166,452, It is not all that it is cracked up to be.,9/10/1975 14:57
1166,1166, Yeah I think it is a harder life then people imagine,3/26/1995 14:09
1167,1854, It is good that they show on the big screen that not even stars have a perfect life.,5/4/1983 4:59
1167,1167, I agree it helps people see the truth,2/15/2012 0:07
1167,1167, The grass is not always greener.,10/3/2010 23:21
1167,1854, SO what else did you like about,1/21/1995 9:02
1167,1854, I enjoyed the part when they stopped in at the little nightclub.,6/19/2002 7:55
1167,1167, What did you think of the ending,7/29/2009 2:17
1167,1167," Hi there, are much of a movie lover?",8/6/2001 19:36
1167,1854," Hi, I do like movies.  Do you?  Have you seen the new A star is born with lady gaga and bradley cooper?",3/3/2022 2:58
1167,1854, No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly,12/9/2004 3:26
1167,1167, I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it.,12/7/1973 1:02
1168,1168," Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo.",4/23/1975 20:08
1168,1569, That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing.,6/1/2021 23:58
1168,1168," Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio.",4/24/1971 7:24
1168,1168, I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her.,6/12/2018 10:06
1168,1569, Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers.,10/2/2009 18:31
1168,1168," That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors?",12/13/1988 15:51
1168,1569, Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there.,5/9/1987 17:27
1168,1569, I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.  I heard that a lady on her way to a dave mathews concert stopped to help a cyclist who turned out to be dave mathews!  I bet she got back stage tickets!,1/25/1998 20:10
1168,1569, Wow you never know really. Do you attend music concerts much?,5/14/2007 11:41
1168,1569, i use too.  Do you?  I would have went to the ABBA reunion tour concert but they turned down a billion dollars to do it.,5/5/1982 4:23
1169,1169," I do from time to time. I know some bands do a lot of concerts, like Linkin park did 324 in 2011 alone.",8/12/1978 22:53
1169,1558," Wow, they were some busy people!  I'd like to go to this concert I heard about that was held for dogs.  Back in 2010 a man and his wife held a high frequency concert just for dogs that were around.",3/29/1988 14:02
1169,1169," That is very different. And Creed, apparently their concert was so bad that people sued them.",10/6/1990 4:34
1169,1558, Hahaha! That's awful and so sad for them!  The band Deep Purple had people pass out due to the loudness of their music. I wonder which would be better to pass out or endure Creed.,3/25/1991 23:35
1169,1169, Go figure. Do you have a favorite instrument?,10/29/1994 23:16
1169,1558, I like the piano and the saxophone.  I've tried to play the guitar before but the strings hurt my fingers way too much.  Do you have a favorite?,4/21/2005 23:05
1169,1169," I think the violin for me. Speaking of the guitar though, Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire when playing the guitar for 'beat it'",6/14/1991 20:49
1169,1169, I wonder if he could play the world's smallest guitar. It was built by some people at Cornell University.,2/6/2000 15:52
1169,1169, Are you a Lady Gaga fan?,8/6/2002 13:07
1169,1558," Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage.",12/10/1983 2:34
1170,1324, I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son?,7/13/1974 11:49
1170,1324," Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff.",6/4/2006 22:13
1170,1170," I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork?",12/18/1973 0:53
1170,1324, I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points.,2/28/1981 0:45
1170,1324, I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now. ,4/26/2016 8:34
1170,1170," Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense.",7/13/2001 1:50
1170,1324, I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure. ,4/15/2008 10:33
1170,1170, I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties.,10/13/2002 6:15
1170,1324, You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts?,9/20/1979 5:54
1170,1170," Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more.",8/4/2005 15:20
1171,1135, I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane!,3/25/1983 10:08
1171,1171," Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds. In Croatia a roman amphitheater is still in use, I'd love to go there.",2/25/1979 4:46
1171,1135," That would be an amazing place to attend a concert. The pictures, the sound, the memory. I would love to do that too. ",7/23/2011 22:10
1171,1135," I'm glad I got to see Linkin Park so many times when I did, since you never know when it will be over. I'm sad I never got to see the Ramones though. Before my time. They played over 2000 shows!",3/27/2015 1:15
1171,1171, I would have seen the Ramones. They have very catchy music and I'm not even a fan of much punk. I had no idea they played that many shows. I know they played at CBGB's a lot so I wonder how many of those were there and how many were tours. ,7/8/1980 20:27
1171,1135, I think there used to be a sign at CBGB's how many times they played there. Of course like the Ramones that place is long gone now too. I'm glad Roger Waters still tours but it would be nice to see Pink Floyd again.,9/8/1990 1:28
1171,1135, It's sad that it's gone. It was such a relic of a cultural movement. I would love to see Pink Floyd. Did you know that they filmed a concert with no audience?,8/9/2009 19:41
1171,1135, Yes in Pompeii! I have the DVD. I believe it was just to have a chance to play in that historic roman venue.,10/3/1991 10:23
1171,1135, I'm glad they were able to do it then. It was very nice chatting with you. You have a great day. ,1/4/1980 0:45
1171,1171," heloo,  how are you doing? Ugg boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold ocean",10/17/2015 19:28
1172,1172, that makes sense! professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pair of shoes in a week. that must be  expensive ,4/27/1977 11:06
1172,1251, Yeah I know right! The nokia company originally got big by making rubber boots. in the 1800's. they still make rubber boots.,11/26/2021 15:04
1172,1251, i had no idea. you can put tea bags in stinky shoes to absorb the smell,3/2/1983 10:48
1172,1251, Ive actually tried this with my snowboarding boots it works great! ,2/8/2013 15:18
1172,1172, thats a neat trick and I might have to try it! although I missed the part about dry my thought was wet and that it would make your shoes wet. lol did you know 500 year old shoes out perform todays shoes,3/15/1972 16:26
1172,1251, I wonder in what way?  I know they were custom before.  The phrase pulling oneself up by their bootstraps originally meant doing something that is pretty much impossible.,6/10/2003 21:12
1172,1172, Maybe because shoes used to be designed for function and not fashion,11/7/2017 11:39
1172,1251," In 1838, a man stopped on the boulevard du temple in paris to get his boots cleaned. he and the cleaner stood still for at least seven minutes on the street, and accidentally became the first people in history to be photographed.",7/8/2002 6:38
1172,1172, I wonder how they accidentally became photographed?,5/21/1979 5:49
1172,1251," No clue,  right place right time.  Maybe he was in the background or something. Farmers used to walk turkeys from norfolk to london for the christmas markets. in the early 18th century, around 250,000 turkeys, many in little custom boots, would take the three-month walk.",4/23/1978 8:26
1173,236, wikileaks published the governments plan to destroy wikileaks. lol talk about irony,1/22/1973 4:20
1173,236, lol weird. 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the us government,10/8/2021 11:32
1173,1173, It must be to hide all of the UFO's! a man in france sold the eiffel tower...twice,10/25/1970 13:20
1173,236, lol how does that even happen! In 2008 the norwegian government donated $1bn to help save the amazon rainforest.,12/26/1984 21:41
1173,236, I am pretty sure that was money not well spent since we always here about deforestation.  gov't is supposed to be the balance between individual freedom and  tyranny...somebody should tell the US government that,8/24/1978 2:36
1173,1173," In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva conventions",3/6/1996 10:57
1173,236, stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes but was not paid to endorse them,3/23/2000 8:43
1173,1173, Thats unfair! ,3/19/2009 1:34
1173,236, agreed!,7/17/1981 11:39
1173,236, Good talking to you ,9/4/2016 12:31
1174,1174," Hi, how are you doing this evening?",2/12/2022 22:53
1174,419, Great.  Did you know Ugg Boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm?,10/5/1972 1:33
1174,1174," Surprised to hear that. I wonder how the surfer would fare with 5,000 year old shoes. ",1/26/2004 8:35
1174,419, They would probably make them into sandals and put dry tea bags in them to remove the smell. ,3/18/1977 15:01
1174,1174," Ah, yes, but what kind of tea? Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes. I bet he doesn't put tea in his shoes.",5/4/1978 4:03
1174,419, I bet they get stolen.  So many of these rich football people and their caring.  The need to put their money where their mouth is like Norway.  They gave $1B to save Amazon rain forests. ,1/16/2005 3:46
1174,1174,  I wish the US gov’t would do something like that.The US gov’t owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I want to know what secret activities they’re engaged in there. Have that many aliens landed in Nevada? Is that their refueling station?,1/29/1986 1:13
1174,1174, Most of that is BLM land leased to ranchers.  That other 14% must be Vegas. ,8/8/1973 13:26
1174,419," A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the US government and then the proceeds could go to the Amazon.",10/7/2000 9:26
1174,1174, Sounds like a plan... He could get in the business of selling used ballet shoes.  They can go through 4 pairs a week.,9/2/1987 9:16
1175,1175, Four pairs. I wonder how they would do with the 5000 year old shoes though.,9/2/2011 4:30
1175,165," Their toes much suffer too.  Maybe there should be ballet boots.  If they fall, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps. ",1/13/2002 21:10
1175,1175, Maybe Stephon Marbury could make an inexpensive line of pointe shoes.,9/17/2019 19:08
1175,165, Another great idea... Or use the boots that the turkey movers do in Norfolk.,3/20/2003 10:39
1175,1175, Turkey mover? Is that a profession?,10/7/2001 22:00
1175,165," Yeah, farmers used to walk turkeys from Norfolk to London in the 18th century. ",1/17/1994 8:56
1175,1175, That sounds like a pleasant excursion. Giant squawking birds for miles on end. ,5/13/1996 19:15
1175,165," Yeah, it only marginally beats out starvation or selling the Eiffel Tower. ",4/21/1988 1:10
1175,1175," Well, hey man, I had a groovy time chatting with you this evening. I hope that you find the shoes that suit you, whatever you choose to do. (turkey mover)",2/9/2017 5:11
1175,1175, Same here -- nice chat.  I sure won't be ballet... ,1/5/2006 19:48
1176,1455," Hey, don't sell yourself short! Turkey ballet!",4/29/2009 23:28
1176,1176, Hee. ,12/8/1991 14:41
1176,1455, CYA,2/4/2022 20:42
1176,1176, Do you shop at LL Bean?,3/5/1971 15:51
1176,1455," Yes, I do.  I wondered when they would stop their lifetime refund guarantee.  People nowadays are just plain crooked.",12/6/1970 2:00
1176,1176, I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that.,5/7/2011 22:21
1176,1176," But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure!",10/27/2000 3:36
1176,1176," This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it.",5/27/2020 12:09
1176,1176," How true.  On a side note, do you own any UGG boots?",8/8/2020 12:05
1176,1176," Not my style.  I see them around all the time now, are they comfortable?",9/3/1978 11:05
1177,11," Yeah, they are very comfortable and quite warm.  Do you know they were invented by surfers?",4/6/1979 15:47
1177,1177, Looking at Uggs I would not associate them with surfing.  I suppose they keep you feet warm?,12/22/2003 21:02
1177,11," Yes, the surfers would put them on after leaving that cold ocean water, to warm up!",1/12/2012 6:35
1177,11," My boot and shoe supply is limited.  I have some work shoes and some running shoes, and one pair of dress shoes.  ",9/25/1998 20:19
1177,11," Well, that's really all one needs!",3/10/2003 23:25
1177,1177," I've tried the trick with the tea bag and smelly shoes, it does remove the smelly odor, replaces it with Earl Grey.",8/16/1984 16:13
1177,1177," How cool, I'll have to give that a try, I have a stinky pair of gym shoes!",5/3/2020 14:50
1177,11," So Nokia use to make boots, difficult to see how they got into phones from that.",3/31/1985 7:14
1177,1177," Rubber boots to be exact, and I think they still make them, too!",4/4/1980 12:10
1177,11, Probably best to stick with the boots.  The whole Smart Phone thing has left Nokia behind.  Maybe they need to pull themselves up by their boot straps.,11/23/2004 7:59
1178,1947," That phrase got its start by meaning to do something that is pretty much impossible.  At this point, I think Nokia has lost the phone game!",8/2/1999 15:30
1178,1947, Thinking about that phrase you can see what it's original meaning was.  Maybe it changed because no one has boot straps now?,4/25/1989 14:03
1178,1947, That's true.  Do you know that pro ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week?,9/24/1990 19:10
1178,1178," A week!  I'm glad my daughter gave up dance after just a few sessions.  Have a good day, nice chatting.",2/5/1998 8:47
1178,1178, Hello - how are you doing today?,12/26/1999 17:54
1178,1947, I'm great! Are you interesting in government?,9/2/2009 2:43
1178,1947, I am interested in some government things. I saw that Wikileaks published the government's plan to destroy Wikileaks. ,7/29/2004 11:31
1178,1178," Wikileaks is not going to be outsmarted by the government. I'm not sure how the gov't could destroy Wikileaks anyway. Too many sites, too many backups.",8/19/1993 13:18
1178,1178, I agree. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government?,4/21/1999 2:12
1178,1947, The gov't must be up to something in Nevada. Maybe Wikileaks knows something about this.,9/23/2002 13:30
1179,1179, That's where Area 51 is located so I'm sure there are lots of secret bases in that state.,9/21/2002 11:58
1179,1284," I think Area 51 is in New Mexico, but I'm not sure. Lots of open space in Nevada. ",4/25/1972 4:27
1179,1179," Oh yea you might be right lol. In 2006, the US passed a bill that would protect the government employees from being charged for violating the geneva conventions.",11/29/1990 20:03
1179,1179," I think that is wrong, but probably there to protect military contractors and stuff. A lot of war going on in 2006. Probably a lot of liability. ",5/2/2006 6:28
1179,1179," Yea, I was deployed to Iraq for the war back in 2005-2006 and then again in 2007.",12/16/1983 12:18
1179,1284, Hm. I guess that you would be protected under the law. You made it back safe and sound I trust? The gov't has no plans to send you again?,6/21/1999 13:46
1179,1284," Yes, I made it back safe and sound thankfully. I was infantry so had some close calls. No plans to deploy again. My enlisted contract ended back in 2008 so I'm finished and 33 years old now.",3/5/1991 0:47
1179,1284," Your gov't service is done! The government has actually shut down 17 times over the past 37 years. it happened 3 times in 1977. During the recent shutdown, most of the military got paid, if I remember correctly.",12/15/1976 20:14
1179,1284, Oh wow I didn't know that. That's good the military stills gets paid during the shutdown. Do you like boots?,12/28/1976 7:49
1179,1284, I don't wear boots usually. I think they are useful for some kinds of work and for cold weather. You?,12/1/1978 22:45
1180,1180, I always wear boots. Especially when I ride my motorcycle. ,8/20/2021 14:07
1180,1011," That's good! Stay safe. Dress for the slide, not for the ride.",8/4/2019 18:41
1180,1011, Haha yep. The Ugg boot was invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after leaving the cold ocean. ,9/5/2016 3:24
1180,1180," And now it's a fashion statement. I don't think the boots are stylish, but what would I know. I don't wear boots.",4/22/1979 21:52
1180,1180, Great talking to you!,6/4/1999 15:51
1180,1011, Hi there. Have you ever been to the White House?,10/1/1989 1:30
1180,1011, i have never been to the white house. i would like to go some day. have you been?,1/1/1979 2:25
1180,1180," I haven't. But if you ever go to Ireland or France, you can see it there, too! Evidently there are twin White Houses there.",12/6/2019 15:57
1180,1011," I bet that it would be a good replica too. i guess i could start there, maybe try out the oval office, see how it feels.",9/4/1998 23:27
1180,1011, Haha. Did you know George Bush had solar panels put back on the White House?,7/30/2001 14:15
1181,806," yeah, carter put them on, reagan too them off. what about trump? what happened to the panels?",2/4/1982 18:44
1181,1181, I'm not sure. They should keep them there. It's good for the environment! I'm surprised Bush was an advocate being an oil fan.,12/30/2020 18:55
1181,1181, I think that he did that for PR reasons. i think that it would look bad for an oilman to do that. i would love more solar in the country.,8/10/1972 12:56
1181,1181," Teddy Roosevelt was quite the conservationist, as well. He banned Christmas trees from the White House during his day.",10/6/1984 6:12
1181,806," Teddy always went out hunting wild animals. i dont understand his thinking. no trees, but animals, yes?",3/22/2018 3:44
1181,806, Maybe he was only hunting the animals that were overpopulated and bad for the environment?,8/5/1993 7:36
1181,1181," Maybe, that is true. i just thought that he would want to leave the animals alone. He was behind the national parks too. great guy for conservation.",1/21/2018 2:22
1181,1181," Yeah, but there are some animals that can become a problem if they aren't hunted, unfortunately. Just the circle of life. ",4/21/2002 9:24
1181,806, True. Maybe he was looking to maintain a balance. The white house still uses floppy disks in part for storing files. I wonder if they used those in Teddy Roosevelt's day? LOL,6/17/2012 6:23
1181,1181," Haha. I would think not. Though, I bet his documents were transcribed and put onto a floppy disk!",1/22/2020 10:22
1182,1068," The white house is an interesting specimen. something of a relic, a kind of time capsule. like a museum. strange how far behind govt can be.",9/3/1973 18:20
1182,1182, I would imagine they still use a floppy disk because it's the most secure way to store data.,7/6/2002 13:01
1182,1068," I guess, but i wonder about encryption and stuff like that. isnt there better tech out there? do they not have the budget for it?",2/28/2011 5:58
1182,1182," I'm sure, but almost all storage seems to require an internet connection these days, so who knows? Well, it's been nice chatting with you.",6/15/1971 17:17
1182,1182, It has been nice chatting. Have a great weekend.,8/30/2018 12:25
1182,1068, You too!,5/19/1996 14:40
1182,1068, Did you vote in the last election?,5/31/2020 2:05
1182,1182, I did. Do you know how they elected people in ancient athens?,8/28/1985 1:10
1182,1182," Yes they were elected by lottery, pretty awesome",8/14/1988 10:41
1182,1068, Yes and it worked for them as they believed otherwise it would lead to oligarchy,4/15/1970 23:14
1183,1098," Yeah, In Nevada you have the option to choose, none of these candidates",12/29/1994 8:37
1183,1183," Yes I like that, it should be applied to all the other states as well",12/5/2000 3:23
1183,1183, Yeah. Maybe that will help increase the voter turnover over 63%,2/1/2019 0:30
1183,1183, Yeah that is a good point. Did you know the taller candidate seems to win usually?,10/16/2006 19:10
1183,1183, Yes that has been the case since 1990 for 75% of the time,3/8/2007 23:59
1183,1183, Right. Did you know the international observes were banned from nine states to check on the polls?,1/15/2010 19:16
1183,1183, Yeah. Did you know the white house has twin buildings in other countries?,1/8/2005 23:23
1183,1183, Yes those are in Ireland and France as well,4/17/2021 2:14
1183,1098, Yeah. ANd they still use floppy discs to save stuff,11/11/2009 13:48
1183,1098, Yeah. Did you know Roosevelt did not allow christmas trees in it?,4/4/1993 12:24
1184,1184, He was that big of a conservationist so I guess that makes sense,9/3/1975 8:32
1184,1184, Yeah. Bush was the one that brought the solar panels back to the house,4/14/1974 13:53
1184,591," Nice. Did you know the white house was shot in November 11, 2011?",11/23/2002 22:16
1184,1184, Yes and it took them four days to figure that out,6/26/1976 19:59
1184,591, That is long considering how much security there is in that building,10/27/2003 12:55
1184,591, Exactly. Do you know who was the first president to live in it?,2/22/1998 17:07
1184,1184, Yes that was John Adams in 1800. Nice chatting with you today.,7/13/1988 6:33
1184,591," Hi, how are you?",12/18/2005 6:35
1184,591, I am great! How are you!,11/26/1974 11:39
1184,1184," Very well, thanks. Are you ready for the Presidential race in 2020?",1/27/2019 7:39
1185,879," I am! For me personally it can't get here soon enough. But whatever happens we will get by! I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting. ",10/15/2004 16:12
1185,1185," Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right...",6/22/1997 0:40
1185,879," I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting.",10/16/1987 6:44
1185,879," If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK. However, I am not alt-roght and think they should be lumped in with them.",11/17/1978 16:39
1185,879, Everyone thinks modern day KKK is not a threat even by the Alt Right but I have to say they are in my opinion. They have committed hate crimes just as much as the other groups. ,1/20/1992 17:22
1185,1185, I agree. I think their speech is just as dangerous. It tells others that hate speech is allowable and endorsed by people like the president. ,5/30/1986 12:26
1185,879," Exactly, couldn't agree more. Our country is so crazy and the books these men are writing prove to be a bit scary on much hate they have seen and heard. But we hope the upcoming election might change things.",2/19/2021 3:07
1185,1185, I agree. It wouldn't surprise me to see someone so frustrated they run. I am thinking Michelle Obama...,7/7/1978 19:19
1185,879, Yes! That is really my thought too. We need a president who has a very good head on their shoulders. How awesome would that be!,8/20/1987 4:38
1185,1185," I think she would be elected without having to outline policy, she is that popular. I think her book primed her run. It was conveniently released around exploratory committee time...",6/28/2019 17:25
1186,1186," Exactly, I think she would have a great chance to be elected. She seems to be what we need right now!",2/3/2018 17:46
1186,1094, I think we just need someone who doesn't marginalize a lot of the country. That's not a high bar to get over. Our current nation is that low right now... Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave.,2/22/2014 21:25
1186,1186, I agree! We just need to hope we get good people running and hopefully more than the average 62% voter rate will climb. We really need this. Has Michelle Obama talked about running?,11/12/2000 3:13
1186,1094," I was just talking about this the other day with a friend. In a country with like 350M people, Hilary and Trump were the two best people we could come up with? No she has not talked about it but I could see it.",6/4/1986 0:16
1186,1186," I agree, that's why I hope we can get someone who could really get this country up and running and uniting. I really think whoever ends up in the White House next is either going to completely break us or start getting us above water, so to speak.",11/16/1978 14:46
1186,1094, I agree. I am fearful that the Democrats will cannibalize the party and it will be tough to make whole going up against the Republican party. Nice I didn't say trump because I am skeptical he will run again. He hates bring president.,8/7/1994 13:10
1186,1094," Exactly. I didn't know Trump didn't like being president. I wish we were not so divided into political groups, so muxh going on. That's why I am not a liberal or conservative.",7/2/2000 15:50
1186,1186, Nice chatting with you!,11/2/2004 18:31
1186,1094, Are you a skin head?,12/12/2004 0:29
1186,1094," That is a really strange salutation but no, I am not a skin head. ",10/9/1976 22:57
1187,1187, Neither am I.  I apologize I have just read some distressing material about skin heads.  Did you know skin heads opposed antifa activists?,7/5/2005 9:42
1187,1187, No problem. Just a strong first sentence. I did not know that. What is the antifa?,5/11/1991 9:10
1187,1187, I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either.,11/10/2008 3:07
1187,1187, Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group,1/5/1975 16:01
1187,1187, Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them.,9/20/2008 17:48
1187,1187, Agreed. Mind if we switch to a lighter subject for the sake of this chat?,9/25/2015 8:17
1187,1714, Sure did you know that shirts encompass many different types of attire for the upper body?,11/11/2001 20:17
1187,1187, I did not.  That makes a lot sense. I use mine to hide my shame.,6/13/1993 13:04
1187,1714, Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts.,11/26/1999 14:54
1187,1187, I would have fit in well during the chinese cultural revolution. They layered!,9/22/2014 9:29
1188,1891, Yes they had some quite interesting clothing.  It is very generic all over the world nowadays.,7/19/2021 18:06
1188,1188, I had no idea the difference between a button down and a button up. Who knew!,2/28/1988 21:34
1188,1188, Me neither it is insane how much we do not know.,5/14/2018 10:11
1188,1891, I do not know a lot more than most people. I just shake my head and smile. It has gotten me this far...,4/29/1983 17:20
1188,1891, Sometimes we must accept our inability to change things much greater than us.  We are like a trickle of water against stone.,8/9/1993 22:19
1188,1891," Speaking of water, teddy roosevelt was a conservationalist.",5/23/1989 6:33
1188,1188, Harambe would be happy to eat pancakes in heaven.,8/19/1992 13:21
1188,1891, With Prince... Seems like a fitting tribute to both...,11/16/2022 0:20
1188,1188, Yes a fitting end to legends.,7/3/1998 12:55
1188,1891, Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding.,5/12/1995 1:14
1189,1189, That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely!,9/30/1985 19:17
1189,1189, There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party!,3/13/2009 10:52
1189,885," Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932! ",1/22/2019 20:02
1189,1189," They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling.",11/24/1988 7:12
1189,885," Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party.",12/7/1978 13:10
1189,1189, Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats. The two parties heritage goes back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party!,2/2/2005 8:34
1189,1189," Yes, and the Republican party as of 2018 was the primary party of power in the USA.  Interesting though that there has not been a non republican / non democrat since 1853.",10/27/1985 16:48
1189,885, Yes I wish that wasn't the case. The more variety the better. 15% of the tea party movement identified as democrats!,3/14/1973 17:27
1189,885, I agree! I think we should all be open minded and not choose a side. the red and blue colors used for republicans and democrats only started being used consistently since 2000. I was watching some documentaries on youtube and it's all pretty interesting.,4/23/2001 7:18
1189,1189, I love youtube! It is the second largest search engine on the net!,10/25/2020 13:33
1190,1190, I watch Youtube a lot! Any little thing you want to find is on there! Google bought Youtube in 2006. Two huge platforms!,8/1/1985 19:51
1190,1190, Yes they are. Gangnam Style got so many views that youtube had to upgrade the view integer to 64 bits!,7/3/2022 2:24
1190,678," Wow, I remember when that was such a huge deal! Interesting that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. That is amazing!",4/2/1988 22:04
1190,1190, Yes people love to watch entertainment! Police actually have their own platform called blutube! I wonder how people can access that service?,9/9/1980 16:45
1190,1190," That is awesome! The police really can benefit from that! I bet an average person can't use their site. I bet it helps them out a lot. My favorite thing to look up on youtube is music, I like the videos. Or the do it yourself video's, how about you?",9/25/1974 5:41
1190,1190," I love DIY videos too, so helpful. I never use the like/dislike feature. But a lot of people disliked Bieber's baby video.",12/19/2005 7:47
1190,1190," I heard that too, which seems strange that it was the most watched video for a long time back when it 1st came out. So many people getting wealthy by having a youtube channel and following....that's what I would like to do lol!",11/1/1998 7:00
1190,678, Yes it would be nice to get endorsed by youtube! You should do it! That way you can contribute to all that internet traffic! Well it was lovely chatting with you!,1/25/1983 19:57
1190,678," Yes, I have been looking into a subscription to a do it yourself type channel! I wonder if the Republicans and Democrats have a Youtube channel? It has been great! Have a great day!",3/16/1990 4:07
1190,678, Bye and see you on youtube!,6/5/2013 16:25
1191,1226," Hi there! I'm not sure about you, but I have recently learned so much about politics!",7/1/1990 4:29
1191,1191," Me too, a lot of cool facts like how the red and blue colors of republicans and democrats started in 2000",8/28/1980 2:10
1191,1191, That is crazy considering how tightly aligned they are now! There has not been a US President since 1953 that was not a Democrat or a Republican.,7/1/1983 23:58
1191,1226, Really since 1953? the other parties should really step up their game,12/17/1985 8:59
1191,1226," Oh darn it, no I meant 1853, so it's been even longer! ",11/22/1985 8:25
1191,1226," Oh that's surprising, maybe one day a president from one of the other parties will win. The last election was a joke I didn't like either of the candidates ",1/8/1996 2:20
1191,1226, I guess every US president until recent that has had a beard is Republican.,7/7/1980 22:03
1191,1226, Seems like you know a lot about the Republican party any cool facts about the democrats?,5/9/1991 16:50
1191,1226, I'm not sure. I feel like I know more about Republicans. What about you?,9/1/1993 15:38
1191,1191," Not many, but 15% of the tea party movement identifies with the democratic party as well",11/24/1993 19:26
1192,1192, I would never have guessed that at all. I like to look up information a lot on YouTube. It is so handy. I'm not surprised the search engine is the second largest.,9/8/1982 10:23
1192,1192, Yeah the second largest after Google and its also owned by Google so there is a monopoly in that field. ,6/2/1997 16:55
1192,640, I just can not believe that Google paid $1.65 billion for it!,4/28/1980 1:05
1192,640," Sounds like a great deal, YouTube must be worth a lot more by now. Google bought the company back in 2006",12/13/1985 5:04
1192,640, I can not even imagine its value. Police share law enforcement videos on their own YouTube called Blue Tube. ,11/18/1995 9:26
1192,1192," That sounds like a really useful service I bet all kind of cool videos are shown in there, kind of boring for the normal user though",10/7/1994 0:10
1192,640," I wonder. I imagine its for training, so probably yes. I've never been a registered user, so I can only view videos, I can not upload any videos on You Tube.",3/18/2011 1:47
1192,1192, Did you watch that video called Gangnam Style? that was a funny video,7/29/1990 16:38
1192,1192," I did, but I never really got into the hype. I know it was really popular though.",2/18/2015 2:19
1192,1192," Yeah in fact they had to upgrade their count integer to 64 bits, it received more view than the site could handle at the time",10/19/2018 14:45
1193,1082, I am shocked. I would think they would just take the video down. ,3/31/2020 14:24
1193,1193," Well the video did make them a fortune so that was not a choice, anyways its been interesting chatting with you. ",6/12/2004 1:24
1193,1193," Yes, it was nice. Have a good night.",5/9/2016 13:12
1193,1193, Do you like tennis ? The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.,6/2/1975 6:20
1193,1193, Wow.  That's a long time. I haven't played since I was in college...and even then I stunk. lol  I much prefer table tennis which is also called ping pong.  lol,4/23/1973 13:03
1193,1193, pIng pong is fun. did you know that a A black man won the 1st us open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since,1/29/1995 22:46
1193,1082, I had no idea.  Maybe it was Arthur Ash?  I remember him from when I was a kid.  Up until 1978 a tennis player could use any object as a racket.  That would have been interesting to see what some might have used.,6/16/1972 23:25
1193,1082, I was thinking Arthur Ash. I love the Polo shirts,3/10/1994 13:21
1193,1082, I used too but am more of a tshirt guy now.  lol  Did you know that some consider grunting before a shot to be a form of cheating?,6/27/1971 10:22
1193,1082, I never know that. I did know that They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open,4/8/1975 2:14
1194,1194," That would have dried them fast.  Tennis generates good money, but not as much as soccer which makes more than all of the other big popular sports combined.",8/30/2002 18:06
1194,1194, Roger Federer is a good player Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles,10/27/1997 23:55
1194,1194," Wow.  Since beginning his career in 1998, that has to make him one of the best of all time?  ",12/11/1997 4:35
1194,1194, He has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 310 weeks,10/27/2016 5:59
1194,1194, Holy smokes!  I wonder how much money he has made?  Novak Djokovic has more career earnings than Federer.,4/30/1984 4:14
1194,965, Wow. Its a good tennis doc on Netflix. ,10/3/1976 23:54
1194,965, I love Netflix.  During Christmas we had the hour long fireplace video Netflix has on there on a loop at our house.,7/22/1983 11:18
1194,1194, Wow. did you know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth,5/19/2006 23:40
1194,1194, That surprises me.  Who rents dvds through the mail anymore?  ,9/28/1997 19:23
1194,965, I thought that had went away years ago. lol. I know Blockbuster is mad for not accepting several offers to buy netflix for $50 million,5/31/1970 19:42
1195,1195, Me too!  lol  That wasn't too smart of a move for sure!,4/18/1977 6:59
1195,1195, Netflix and youtube is taking up most of the the peak internet traffic ,9/12/1984 14:34
1195,792, I believe that.  People love videos.  Netflix employs a team of taggers who are paid to watch Netflix and tag the content.  What a job to have.,5/13/2005 23:47
1195,1195, I would love to have it. ,6/23/2022 3:11
1195,792," Hi, do you like tennis?",4/18/1980 4:44
1195,1195, Not that much. If they still used a Helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts like they did in the 1969 open I would watch.,2/5/2001 16:00
1195,792, What if they did that while they played? It would increase the degree of difficulty.. would you watch?,9/19/1978 22:07
1195,1195, Haha that would be funny and kind of scary! The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. That would bore me for sure.,12/16/1990 9:38
1195,792, I remember that. It was a Jon Isner match in like wimbeldon. They had to stop due to the darkness and exhaustion.,2/10/1987 5:50
1195,1195, The Roger Federer of paddle tennis wasn't that great apparently because US Open quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat him within days of learning how to play.,11/27/1978 15:28
1196,1196, Huh... No black man has won the us open since 1968 when arthur ashe won.,5/23/1982 10:17
1196,1952," Wow, wonder why. Federer has one 20 grand slam singles title, the most ever for a male player.",11/24/2021 8:16
1196,1952, Did you hear how he tore his meniscus?,4/11/1990 15:33
1196,1196," I'm not sure, was it in a game?",6/19/1978 13:01
1196,1196," No, he was drawing a bath for his daughter in 2016 and tore it. It was the worst injury of his career.",3/9/1981 1:14
1196,1196," Whoops, how ironic! I wonder if it slowed him down much? Since 2000 he and a couple of other players have accounted for 56 percent of men's grand slam titles.",11/16/1992 14:49
1196,1196, I do not think so. He was gifted 2 cows though. What does one do with cows?,6/15/1985 0:20
1196,1196, EAT THEM! No? That is odd though. And he has also been honored with an official stamp.,5/20/1984 6:30
1196,1196, I am fine with eating them but who butchers them? Can you see him doing it?,12/31/2011 18:20
1196,1196," Haha, no. I do wonder what he really did with them.",9/17/2010 15:52
1197,1830, Did you see the match where he competed on half grass and half clay?,9/20/1983 20:19
1197,1197, I didn't see that. That's so interesting. Wonder why they competed there and why the court was like that.,6/15/1992 1:38
1197,1830," It was a challenge between he and nadal. Who was better, Roger on grass or nadal on clay...",8/1/2015 9:48
1197,1197," Ohh, that sounds cool. I would watch that match, though I do prefer watching Netflix.",7/22/1973 1:10
1197,1830, Me too... Nice chatting with you!,7/11/2018 4:16
1197,1830, Do you have hope for Pelosi and the democrats in providing balance to the government at this all important time in history.,5/25/2009 21:47
1197,1197, I am not very into politics. The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson.,1/26/2017 20:40
1197,1197, Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate.,4/27/1988 18:01
1197,1830, Why not? Anything in particular?,7/5/1980 2:37
1197,1197, She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume.,4/2/2006 9:23
1198,1198, I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853?,1/24/2008 0:07
1198,1198," No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000",9/16/1998 19:54
1198,1769, I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican.,9/19/2004 6:47
1198,1198," Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland.",10/30/1989 22:18
1198,1769, I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans,3/14/2011 19:19
1198,1198, Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt.,9/5/2013 9:42
1198,1769, The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928!,7/16/1983 18:23
1198,1769, That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office.,5/29/2012 20:56
1198,1769," The GOP presently hold trifectas (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a trifecta plus (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents.",12/16/1983 11:56
1198,1769, I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently. ,5/31/2017 5:42
1199,1199, Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda.,4/14/1988 0:58
1199,1792, Sounds just like fox.  Do you know the republicans actually started out opposing slavery.,7/24/1977 17:40
1199,1792," I didn't realize that, no. ",12/18/1979 5:00
1199,1792, A small percentage of Tea partiers identify themselves as democrats,10/12/1996 5:43
1199,1199, I think I heard 15%.,2/20/2008 3:01
1199,1199, You are correct.,7/22/2004 2:43
1199,1792, Hey what do you think about tennis? I used to play in high school,8/19/2009 1:42
1199,1199, I watched it a lot when I was younger. It is the sport that brought us the Polos,11/30/2005 18:05
1199,1792, Yep you're right! People think that the polo was created by a polo player but it was actually created by a tennis player haha. How weird,12/20/1995 18:03
1199,1199," I know, Rene made history with those shirts so many people prefer them now",2/15/1995 17:54
1200,1200, Haha I like how his nickname was the crocodile and now polos have crocodiles on them. That actually makes a lot of sense haha.,4/20/1999 22:03
1200,1200, Yes it does  and there is a whole brand named Lacoste. What an invention,7/26/2010 9:19
1200,1200, Yep he's a genius haha. Another genius is the guy who used a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts back in 1969,10/10/1993 4:37
1200,921," Talk about innovation, wow. Do you know how long the longest game in tennis took?",12/20/1999 10:40
1200,921, Wasn't it like 3 days. But the game was only 11 hours but still that's a ton! Do you think it's weird that only one black man has won the US Open?,6/8/1999 6:55
1200,1200," Yeah I find that weird too. Do you know Roger Federer, who he is?",7/17/1988 17:25
1200,1200, I do know Rodger Federer. He's actually really awesome at tennis. I can't believe that one guy beat him after learning how to play tennis only a couple days earlier. In fact that is astounding to me,6/19/1973 12:29
1200,1200, Yeah that is cool. And he once competed with Nadal in a field half of which was clay,4/22/2010 8:27
1200,921, Wow I didn't know that. I guess he was also gifted two cows for winning some games. I can think of a lot better prizes personally haha,1/8/2010 22:22
1200,921, And he is the only person in Switzerland that is honored with an official stamp,9/6/1993 0:33
1201,1201, That's cool. One funny thing is that he did a stretch that was too wide and apparently tore his meniscus period and that was drawing a bath for his daughter LOL,6/30/1983 22:09
1201,612," Wow, you never know. Do you like watching anything else on TV beside tennis?",8/26/1971 6:05
1201,612, Well I do have Netflix. I watch a lot of stranger things and also Glow. what about you. I actually don't have cable I just watch netflix and youtube,4/21/2003 6:10
1201,1201," Nice, well those two make up half of the internet traffic anyways in north america",6/30/2009 3:11
1201,612, Yep I like how they started off being worth 50 million when Blockbuster was going to buy them. And now Netflix is worth about two billion dollars. That is so insane. I bet Blockbuster is super mad about that. Do you know if they are out of business already?,11/16/2001 17:36
1201,1201, Oh they are out of business alright. They could have made millions if they took that opportunity,9/29/2000 1:33
1201,612, LOL you're right. I kind of miss them though. I like going to the store to pick out movies. But the fees is what actually started Netflix in the first place LOL. It was a copy of Apollo 13,11/18/1971 11:06
1201,1201, Hi!  Do you watch Tennis?,10/6/1982 4:50
1201,1201, Yes. Tennis is a racket sports played against individuals and Tennis is a olympic sports played at all ages.,12/31/2004 7:38
1201,612, I think it is heat that the iconic polo shirt was invented by a tennis player!  Lacoste's nick name was the crocodile.,9/2/2012 19:28
1202,1202, There are four Grand slam tournament which is very popular. The modern game of tennis is originated in England.,5/28/2015 19:23

1202,1204, Tennis played in ancient period at 12 century. In modern used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis court. There are very aggressive fan for tennis.,6/10/2010 5:47
1202,1202, The longest game of tennis was 11 hours long.  They had to spread it over three days!  That is crazy about the helicopters thought.  How inventive.,10/26/2013 6:50
1202,1204," Five years ago, Nicholas Mahut lost the longest match in tennis history to John Isner.",1/1/1970 5:58
1202,1204, That must have taken a lot of endurance to play. ,7/30/2016 3:17
1202,1204, They are fit and and energetic to play for 11 hours. It shows how they are fit for the game and playing very aggressively.,1/20/1991 20:11
1202,1204, Have you heard of Roger Federer?,3/14/1983 6:43

1203,1936, Did you hear how he received the biggest injury of his career?,9/1/1970 16:16

1203,1203," Wow.  In 2016, he was giving his daughter a bath and tore his meniscus.  ",10/25/2003 19:42

1203,1203," He is certainly talented.  In his career, he has been given two cows for some of his wins.",12/15/2009 11:18
1203,1936, Roger and Rafael nadal competed in tennis on a special court which was half clay and half grass.,6/14/2000 18:21
1203,1936," I heard about that, back in 2007.  I wonder what that looked like.  Good chat.  Have a good day!",9/18/2019 19:39
1203,1203, Do you like horror films? ,11/20/1981 11:14

1204,385, Apparently Stephen King thought Bambi was a horror movies. ,4/8/1979 6:45
1204,1204," I guess King was scared when Bambi's mother was killed, or doesn't like deers",12/19/2008 19:49
1204,1204," yeah, I can't remember the story to be honest. What about google, do you use it a lot? ",2/6/2021 7:19
1204,385," Yea, it's crazy a single google search using more computing power than the apollo moon missions",6/5/2002 5:17
1204,385," Interesting, I didn't realize that. How does google calculate traffic? ",12/20/1971 14:56
1204,1204," I guess it uses data from peoples phones to calculate traffic, that's pretty unsettling",6/10/2022 3:22
1204,385, That is pretty cool. Did you know they have goats cut their lawn? ,4/25/2022 2:00
1204,385," I've heard that, you figure they would just use lawn mowers unless they were broke after they started in 1998",10/10/2008 7:18

1205,255," That is hilarious, they must be well rested. I wonder why they sleep so much? ",11/19/1999 0:58

1205,255," I'm not sure, that would be interesting to find out. ",11/28/1993 13:16
1205,255, Do you like to play tennis?,6/12/2006 11:50
1206,589, I'm not sure. i never really gotten to play.  Do you?,11/6/2004 7:43
1206,1206," I do, Im really bad at it but I think its a great sport, it can be played among two people which is a great advantage. Do you like the sport?",2/4/1990 22:45
1206,589, I do like to watch some games.  It looks like it can be a lot of fun!  I've heard though that the longest match in history was 11 hours long and lasted over 3 days.  That i'm not so sure i would like.,6/9/2015 14:51
1206,1206," That is a really long game, they must have been exhausted and the fans bored out already. ",8/18/1971 12:07
1206,1206, Probably so.  But tennis is very competitive so the players though exhausted most likely kept fighting.,8/31/2007 5:58
1206,589, Do you like polo shirts? cool fact about them but they were actually created by a tennis player,8/21/1997 3:33

1206,1206," They were invented by Rene The Crocodile Lacoste, it was adopted later by polo players but it seems they stole all the credit lol",8/13/1991 20:29
1206,589," Yep they did!  Hey, do you watch netflix?",9/15/1975 22:28
1206,589," I do like to watch Netflix, a lot of interesting content for a small price. ",2/11/2001 11:39
1207,400, I agree.  It's weird to think that it started back in 1997 though.  I guess because it is focusing on streaming now it just seems like a newer company.,1/26/1996 13:54
1207,1207," Its worth $2 billion dollars by now, so yeah, I wonder if the service will be around much longer",10/19/1974 10:17
1207,1207, Two billion dollars and to think it all started because Reed Hastings was mad about a forty dollar late fee on a vhs movie!,3/16/1994 1:58
1207,1207," Yeah a $40 late fee and the movie Apollo 13, I wonder if theres a tennis documentary on Netflix, maybe Roger Federer appears on it. ",7/27/1990 12:14
1207,400, I bet he does. He's ranked number 3 in the world currently and held the number 1 spot for a record total of 310 weeks.,11/2/1979 7:03
1207,1207," He is a great player, I do like him, he is a legend just like Nadal and Djokovic. ",3/26/2000 5:22
1207,1207, The three of them have made up 56% of men's grand slam singles titles over the past 18-19 years.,7/13/2013 14:03

1207,1207," Oh and oddly enough, he's been gifted with two cows over his career!",9/25/2000 8:26

1208,1854, I love horror movies and always have. I just read that Stephen Kings first horror movie was Bambi of all movies to be terrified of ? lol,2/14/1995 12:11
1208,1854, I love horror movies as well and yeah I dont see running for my life if I see bambi lol,8/28/1973 2:51
1208,1854," So all this time i have been watching horror films , i have actually been burning calories. It is said that you can burn more than 180 calories. Wow. Must be because of the adrenaline pumping?",4/12/2014 22:04
1208,1208," Im going to watch a bunch then lol, I heard that if you see abstract art before a horror movie you will enjoy it more. ",3/9/2018 12:59
1208,1854," Thats cool. You know the movie the Shining? Well, the little boy Danny didnt even know he was acting in a film till way later, that was a good idea i think because the Shining is super scary",5/23/2001 19:05
1208,1854," I know! I also craped my pants when I watched it, I thought it was pretty good and Danny sold the part. How can you not know its a horror movie though.",12/25/1998 7:58
1208,1854," He was so young so i guess he didnt see the scarier stuff. As i am thinking of horror , the movie Cats Eye came to mind. I love cats so i got the best of both in that movie..horror and cats..lol",12/5/2011 20:53
1208,1208," I love cat too, I have one, I learn this fact lately that when it reaches 15 years of age they have span 10 of them sleeping.",3/30/1977 19:42

1209,1209," I didnt know that, and what was the name of your cat mine is Camaleona.",11/27/2018 8:16
1209,1209," My cat was Priscilla. Check this out !!! Once a physicist actually used his cat as a co author while writing a book , so he could write using first person and not be judged harshly",1/22/2014 19:10
1209,574," Thats a cute name, and I didnt know that, thats an interesting fact I heard that a town in Alaska has a cat as its mayor.",6/30/2003 11:58
1209,1209, Lol. I bet if we used the search engine Google we could find lots of interesting facts and pictures of cats. Google has been around since 1998 and it we typed in cat that single google search requires a lot of computing power just like what sent men to the moon,3/23/2009 23:07
1209,1209," I know, there are a lot of cool facts, like the cat that was in the opening scene in the godfather 1.",11/20/2009 6:16
1209,574," Oh yes in the Godfather movie that cat was actually a stray they found. What about on the topic of horror movies again, that cat from Pet Sematary? Now that was a scary cat which wasnt valued for companionship any longer. Lol",5/22/1977 23:09
1209,1209," Yeah, it was scary, I used google to get a better glance, I think google is a great company, has interesting apps.",2/24/1972 16:10
1209,1209, Yes Google is amazing.  You know Google is so popular that in 2013 when Google went down for 5 minutes it took 40 % of the web traffic with it ! ,12/17/1981 13:13
1209,574," That crazy, we depend on google a whole bunch, 40% is a lot of users.",3/1/1982 20:47
1209,574," Yes we rely on Google not only for a search engine but for cloud computing, software, hardware, maps and online advertising. i am sure the creator Larry Oage and SErgey ",12/6/2008 5:41
1210,706," I must have at least 5 google apps on my phone, did you know that google maps calculates traffic using android devices.",12/5/1973 4:08
1210,1210, yes i use google maps all the time. I love Google its americas top search engine and i really love the other two topics of the horror movie and cats. Its interesting to me to be able to talk with you about all 3. i will be googling some more scary movies later with cats in them. lol. ,6/14/2018 13:33
1210,1210," I think I will do that as well lol, in going to use google to browse for a horror movie and usually they have cats in them. ",7/1/1985 23:59
1210,706," Hi there!  Do you follow or enjoy tennis at all?  I play it a lot more than I follow it, but I do know that Roger Federer has the most Grand Slam titles in history!",12/23/2017 8:54
1210,706," I do, Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players, do you know who he is? and Federer is a great player as well I really like him",3/29/2016 12:06
1210,1210, I do not know much about Juan Martin del Potro.  I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion.,9/20/1990 12:52
1210,706," His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well",5/5/2022 5:34
1210,1210, He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible!,7/29/2005 15:49
1210,706," Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury",4/22/2009 7:30
1210,1210," Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000.",1/8/2000 4:58
1211,1211," Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp",10/19/1994 22:54
1211,1966, That is great.  He has held the #1 spot in the ATP rankings for 310 weeks!  That is Tiger Woods type stuff!,9/18/1998 20:58
1211,1211," Yeah definitely, a low point in his career was 2016, he suffered a big injury then",7/22/1985 5:44
1211,1211," Yes, while bathing his daughters of all things.  Crazy!",4/6/2003 21:32
1211,1211," Really? I thought it was during a match, tough way of getting injured",6/28/1994 3:02
1211,1211," Yea, no kidding.  Tennis players are usually in such good shape too.  The longest match ever went on for 11 hours over the course of 3 days!",5/24/2000 14:28
1211,1211, 11 hours and 3 days wow!! both players could get injured in the way,7/22/1989 8:24
1211,1211," Yea, you would think that is borderline dangerous!",9/18/2016 8:17
1211,1966," That shouldnt be allowed anyways, do you know the tennis player Gael Memphis?",11/20/1995 11:24
1211,1211, I have heard a story of him beating the best paddle player in the world after just learning how to play.  Is that true?,1/18/1972 18:39
1212,1212," First time hearing about it, if its true then its really amazing",6/16/1974 6:52
1212,1212, That is remarkable.  The sport used to be a lot more influential than it is today.  I recently learned polo shirts were originally invented specifically for tennis!,5/9/1973 7:21
1212,1826," Thats a new one, who invented them do you know?",7/16/1999 23:42
1212,1826, Rene the crocodile Lacoste!  What a name!,7/7/2008 10:23
1212,1212," Probably the creator of the Lacoste brand, either way his contribution is great I love to wear polo shirts. ",2/26/1976 1:48
1212,1826, Hello - how are you today?,4/25/1979 16:26
1212,1212," I'm doing pretty good, how about yourself?",10/2/2015 18:45
1212,1826, I'm doing good too. Do you like horror films?,10/1/2015 9:01
1212,1212," I do, I need to watch a marathon today. They say that watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories!",10/12/2020 19:24
1212,1826," Haha that's funny! If you watch a horror movie before you look at abstract art, you will enjoy the art more apparently.",9/16/1976 16:50
1213,1871, That's interesting. Did you know Danny from The Shining did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later.,10/12/1993 9:31
1213,1871, Oh wow I didn't know that. Pretty interesting he didn't know. ,11/23/2016 11:17
1213,1213, I've always wondered if they tell young kids what kind of movie they're in while filming. Did you know that Stephen King was terrified when he saw Bambi as a child?,7/14/2008 0:23
1213,1213, I saw that - pretty funny he was scared of Bambi. Do you use Google?,3/6/1980 14:36
1213,1213," I do, it's like my best friend. I ask it everything. ",8/5/1994 18:49
1213,1871, Haha same here. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon.,6/20/2022 11:52
1213,1871, That's crazy how far technology has came. I heard that Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,7/1/1983 15:13
1213,1213, Wow that's amazing. Google maps will tailor its maps whenever there is a disputed border. ,1/1/2021 6:07
1213,1871, That's pretty neat. I wish I worked at their headquarters. Instead of hiring people to mow the lawns they once used hundred of live goats. I would have been playing with the goats all day. Haha,5/7/1972 20:51
1213,1213, Haha that would be fun. Do you like cats?,12/3/2012 21:51
1214,1214," I tolerate cats is more like it. I have a Maine Coon that is a barn cat that is a terror. She's only nice at feeding time. She's almost 15, and they say that once cats reach that age it has usually spent 10 years of it's life sleeping. I'm not so sure about her though.",1/5/2007 8:39
1214,1214, That's cool. I can't have any animals with fur because my wife is allergic to them. ,9/2/2013 15:40
1214,525," Bummer, maybe you could go to a cat cafe in Japan or Taiwan. You can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.",1/26/2009 5:36
1214,525, That would be kinda fun to do. The cat in Godfather part 1 was actually a stray. ,8/16/1996 8:31
1214,1214, That's cool. I wonder if it got a good home after the filming? There's a town in Alaska called Talkeetna that has had a cat named Stubbs as it's mayor since 1997.,1/5/1996 0:54
1214,1214, It was great talking to you!,10/18/2017 7:20
1214,525," Hi there, do you watch video on YouTube?",6/16/1996 22:13
1214,1214," Occasionally. I like to play Bob Ross' Joy of Painting for my dogs while I'm at work, and YouTube has full episodes of it.",1/29/2008 8:45
1214,525, Yeah I like him too. You Tube is the second largets search engine nowadays,6/20/1987 1:00
1214,1214," I'm not surprise. At one point, it consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000.",11/22/1987 18:32
1215,258, Yeah that is crazy. Bieber's Baby song seems to be the most disliked video in there. Poor guy,8/5/1974 14:06
1215,1215," I don't feel as badly for him as I do for the three guys who created YouTube. Evidently, Google bought it for only 1.65 billion dollars over a decade ago. I feel like it's probably worth way more now!",1/10/1988 1:50
1215,258, I bet it is for sure. Have you heard of Bluetube?,7/28/1975 20:06
1215,1215, I haven't. What is BlueTube?,4/10/1970 11:19
1215,1215, It is a police YouTube and you can check out law enforcement videos in it,1/15/1978 4:23
1215,1215," That's pretty cool. I remember when YouTube was completely free, and was mostly cute animals.",7/26/1976 5:49
1215,258, Yeah the good times. Did you know they had to increase the video view after Gangnam Style came out?,4/27/1984 23:51
1215,258, That's crazy. I wonder how many views the very first upload has by new. That one with the guy talking about an elephant.,9/6/2019 16:38
1215,1215," Yeah I wonder about that too. On another topic, do you follow politics much?",1/26/1992 21:59
1215,258, I do. I love politics. There are a lot of fun facts about the government I find fascinating. Like the congressional baseball game that has been going on for over a hundred years? They should televise that!,7/7/1998 15:21
1216,797, I would love to see that. Did you know Truman refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride?,9/6/2011 8:36
1216,1216," Haha, yeah. He didn't want to be associated with the Republican party. I guess Hillary didn't, either, since she used to be the President of the Young Republicans club in school.",8/30/1999 8:18
1216,1216," THat is such a huge change for her, wow. Did you know every republican president has had a beard?",8/5/2001 22:15
1216,1216," Yeah, Hillary wasn't the only one to change her mind; Reagan was originally a Democrat! I don't think Donald Trump has a beard, but I think every president who has had a beard was a Republican. ",3/4/1971 22:01
1216,1216," Yeah I was thinking about that, maybe he decided to change that. The colors blue and red were adopted by both parties only stated in 2000 I did not know that. ",4/20/1984 12:21
1216,1216, That's pretty funny. I wonder if it's because that was when internet and the spread of information really took off? There needed to be more branding to differentiate.,7/5/2017 17:15
1216,1216," I guess so, that is actually a really good point. Nice chatting with you.",8/12/2007 14:32
1216,797, Do you like tennis?,6/26/1997 5:49
1216,1216," I do like tennis, do you?",4/2/1981 11:57
1216,1216, I like it as well Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players glad he too the U.S. Open home,2/13/2011 2:50
1217,628, Isn't he from Argentina?,6/8/1984 23:19
1217,1217," He is from Argentina, his hometown is called Tandil",10/20/1972 10:18
1217,628, I love how he treats his friends and has their backs. I would want to live like that.,4/18/2009 14:43
1217,628," I agree thats a great trait to have, he is 29 years old and I think this is the first time winning a US Open, his had a lot of skilled oponents over the years",5/19/1996 17:31
1217,1217, did you know the polo shirt was invented by a tennis player?,4/14/2016 6:14
1217,1217," No didnt know that, I guess tennis players also used polo players to play",11/2/2009 14:09
1217,628, I guess it was invented by Rene the crocodile Lacoste. Hence the name of the brand and crocodile shirt.,7/11/2022 13:59
1217,628," Interesting, Lacoste is a brand that I like a lot, do you know how long the longest game on tennis history lasted?",1/17/2013 15:45
1217,1217," I do not, how long? ",2/19/2000 21:46
1217,628, it lasted over 3 days!!! thats a really long time,6/10/2001 16:24
1218,1218, I bet Jon Isner was involved. That guy plays the longest matches. Do you like Federer?,1/29/1982 19:00
1218,1348," Yeah Federer is another one of my favorites, the Swiss pro player",9/11/2001 13:45
1218,1218, Did you see that he tore a meniscus when he stretched too far while drawing a bath for his daughter? What a freak accident!,4/2/1999 22:10
1218,1348," That is a harsh way to get injured, it was one of the worse injuries in his career in fact",2/8/2011 7:57
1218,1218, At least he has the honor of being the first living person in switzerland to be honored with a stamp.,4/14/1988 2:33
1218,1218," Yeah, and has also won many ATPS, US Opens and about every tennis comptetition out there",3/26/2012 7:21
1218,1348, He has been gifted two cows too! I mean what the heck is he going to do with 2 cows?,7/5/2008 14:27
1218,1348," 2 cows really? what does that have to do with Tennis lol, hopefully we will see his life in a documentary in Netflix one day",9/14/1979 21:54
1218,1218," Yeah, that would be an interesting watch. It was great chatting with you!",4/23/1986 14:52
1218,1218," Hi, how are you?",3/9/1983 5:53
1219,892, I'm doing great! How are you doing tonight?,6/23/1999 17:39
1219,892," I am doing well, thanks! Do you like tennis?",6/12/2002 6:03
1219,1219, I don't really know the sport well. I know that it can earn some people lots of money.,5/1/1997 18:26
1219,1219," Well, let me inform you! They once used a helicopter to dry the grass for the 69 us open!",9/27/1979 23:02
1219,892," A helicopter? Well, I guess rich folk have all kind of resources at their disposal. Never needed to do that again, I guess.",2/12/2020 2:57
1219,1219, I would have just had to tried to blow it dry with my breath. Would have taken forever!,7/26/2013 21:35
1219,892," They know how to think big in tennis, that's for sure. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I wonder if anyone watched the whole thing.",2/12/1973 7:09
1219,892, They would have been sleepy after! Like I am after binge watching some netflix.,5/22/1973 8:34
1219,892, Netflix has fostered so much binge watching. People spend weekends immobile because of Netflix.,2/8/2015 23:17
1219,1219, I know! hey have 137 million subscribers worldwide! THat's crazy!,12/15/2014 23:34
1220,1220," The cash flow must be solid. They are expanding all the time, but still pay a lot in postage. I wonder why.",2/24/2003 22:39
1220,1220, I wondered that too! They do make up half of internet traffic along with youtube!,9/10/1997 2:00
1220,737," That's intense. People love video. The origins of the company are funny, though.",11/3/1979 11:20
1220,1220, What is the origin?,7/10/1973 1:49
1220,737," After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 13, reed hastings was inspired to start Netflix. Reed got angry, and started a new company that put Blockbuster out of business.",8/30/1986 20:33
1220,1220, What a dumb and inefficient way to make $40! That came back to bit them in the rear!,3/11/2016 18:06
1220,1220, Yes. Blockbuster underestimated the value of Netflix too. ,7/22/2000 3:04
1220,737, Yeah! They were off by quite a bit. Like $2B!,11/2/1981 17:12
1220,737, I think BB imagined that they could copy Netflix easily. It's sometimes simpler just to buy a turnkey operation. ,10/11/2014 8:45
1220,737, Good point! Nice chatting with you!,6/18/2022 13:52
1221,242, Hi how are you?!,12/20/1982 3:38
1221,242, I'm good!  Do you like animals?,2/15/1977 2:32
1221,242, I do! did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on earth?,7/15/1999 20:35
1221,242, Wow.  I didn't know there was that many.  It's estimated that over 1.5 million living animal species have been described.,6/13/2013 11:52
1221,242, That is a lot. What is your favorite animal?,10/18/2007 20:07
1221,242, Hahah my favorite animals are frogs.  Been fascinated with them ever since I was a kid for some reason.,4/25/2014 10:09
1221,1221, Interesting! Did you know under provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act the lochness monster is a protected species? hahaha,1/23/2018 14:51
1221,242, That's funny!  The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.  I think they try to get on the roads to get warm at night and that's when they get hit.,7/1/2018 10:54
1221,242," Intriguing! Crazy that humans have lost their body hair 240,000 years ago.",5/24/1979 5:25
1221,242, Interesting. lol  There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  That's a different kind of lawyer job.,4/28/1996 13:24
1222,433, So weird. I would sue humans if I were an animal.,12/10/2016 0:52
1222,1222, lol  yes.  They sure have gotten the short end of the stick that's for sure.  Do you like horses?  I had them while growing up.,11/17/1975 14:05
1222,1222, I love horses. Never had one. I heard humans domesticated horses around 4000 bc.,4/25/1980 12:13
1222,433, I believe it.  95 percent of all modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace their Y chomosome to one horse named Darley Arabian.  ,6/3/2002 15:42
1222,433, Interesting! Did you know Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses?,1/24/1994 12:10
1222,1222, lol No.  That's interesting since he starred in so many Western movies!,4/21/1991 6:39
1222,1222, Seriously. Hopefully he got over that allergy by now.,6/15/1989 8:14
1222,433," Yes.  I'm not sure.  Did you know that horses, sharks, and orangutans are all ticklish?  lol",5/29/1997 8:15
1222,1222, That is funny. I also did not know that germany became the first country to universally give animals constitionally legal rights.,2/1/1982 9:19
1222,1222, I didn't know that either!  The length of a horse hair is strongly related to the amount of sunlight it gets. Interesting.,1/14/1986 18:53
1223,1223," Interesting, I had no idea.",5/23/1971 23:12
1223,228," I didn't either.  I also just learned that once an Icelandic horse leaves Iceland, it can never come back.  I had a good time chatting with you!",10/4/2006 8:10
1223,228, Are you a fan of horses? ,4/21/1996 3:55
1223,1223, I like them. I know dalmatians are associated with fire departments because they would calm the horses,11/12/1999 14:29
1223,228," Interesting, I didn't know that. Did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed? ",11/10/1983 9:51
1223,1223, Really! Do you know why they have it?,6/15/2005 10:06
1223,228," I think it is a speedwalk, but I'm not really sure. ",8/18/1977 17:52
1223,228, Oh cool! Did you know that even though Clint Eastwood was featured on horses for many of his movies he actually had a mid-life allergy to them?,6/5/1991 17:17
1223,228," Interesting, I wonder if he takes medicines during the scenes. ",12/15/1980 7:58
1223,1223," I would think so! It is crazy how human's work, isn't it? ",1/29/2015 21:44
1224,1224," Yeah, it is. Apparently they lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. ",5/30/2004 13:47
1224,1293, And yet we still have some. Humans' adaptation for persistence hunting makes them among the best distance runners among all running animals.,12/25/2000 7:19
1224,1224, It is pretty weird. Did you know that we will grow a rib in only 2-3 months? ,11/10/1981 2:45
1224,1224, No kidding! I had no idea humans could regenerate ribs.,8/14/2018 15:14
1224,1293, Interesting isn't it. Did you know there is a frequency that causes fear? ,8/11/1973 9:26
1224,1293," No, I did not. Did you know that almost all h=animals and plants can synthesize their own vitamin c but humans can't because their gene for this enzyme is defective.",1/31/1988 3:25
1224,1224, Did you know that there are 20 quintillion animals on the earth? ,4/30/1996 1:43
1224,1293, Holy cow! That's a lot. I have heard that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,5/23/2017 5:32
1224,1224," Interesting, is this all animals? ",8/11/1977 10:46
1224,1293, I believe so. Hard to believe but the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species under provisions of a 1912 Scottish protection of animals.,6/25/1974 15:34
1225,214, I can believe it. Is it also a national mascot? ,1/30/2003 18:29
1225,214," That's a good question, but I do not know the answer.",12/10/1997 4:18
1225,214, Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from when land animals had gills and lungs?,7/24/1977 6:40
1225,1225, I have never heard that before! Crazy.,6/3/1998 5:30
1225,214," Yeah, it is. Nice chatting with you. ",8/15/1976 11:55
1225,1225," I like Walt Disney, how about you.",6/26/1978 18:58
1225,1225, Yes I like Walt Disney a lot. Did you hear about the Lion King remake that they're coming out with though? Is it live action or not?,10/4/2004 9:17
1225,1225," I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it?",11/6/1995 14:07
1225,214, No they haven't come out with the Remake yet. But I did see the stage show and I also saw a movie which are both great. Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way,5/18/2017 22:36
1225,214," They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them",6/13/1970 15:40
1226,962," Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi",7/23/2016 13:52
1226,962," For sure, it is amazing what they can do. Frozen was a good song, ever seen it?",4/18/1972 6:56
1226,1226, Yes I did like that movie. I think it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman.  ,8/9/1971 13:41
1226,1226," For sure, that is a good stat. They need more women directing disney movies ",3/3/1990 7:46
1226,962," Yes I think so. What do you think about the movie Big Hero 6? That was actually decent, it's not my favorite but it is impressive they used a 50,000 core computer to render it",4/17/2017 11:34
1226,962," Wow, I did not know. I liked that movie and it makes sense.",8/26/2007 16:31
1226,1226, Did you ever see the movie Up by the way? Apparently it would take 9 million balloons to actually lift the house LOL that's insane,8/24/1984 18:49
1226,1226," Lol, that would be so many balloons, and so much helium! People would be talking funny for days if they all popped.",10/7/2011 17:11
1226,962, Haha that's a good point. Do you think anyone has ever attached so many balloons to themselves that they floated away LOL,10/6/2010 19:50
1226,1226, For sure! Do you have a favorite animal?,5/18/1988 12:00
1227,1308, Yes my favorite animal is the dog! Dogs are so awesome and that they love humans makes me happy haha what about you,2/1/1988 8:56
1227,1308, Me too. I love dogs so much! There are 20 quintillion animals on planet earth. So many!,8/3/1970 12:29
1227,1308, That is a lot! What school is that you know how humans have a dominant side like you're right-handed or whatever? Apparently dogs have a dominant paw side too LOL,12/10/1977 23:55
1227,1308," Just like humans, that is awesome. Good chatting with you!",8/2/1972 21:22
1227,1308," Yes you as well, make sure to check your dog for a distinct dialect though, apparently depending on where animals are from they will sound different",6/28/1996 17:24
1227,1227," for sure, bye!",2/26/1987 8:45
1227,1308," hello, I love horses. One of my fav are the icelandic horses. They go very fast. ",6/23/2002 23:44
1227,1308," Hello, I love horses also. I like how the get along with the Dalmatians that are with firefighters that protect them.",8/14/1972 10:41
1227,1308, There was a fire here in LA and so many horse were saved by out firefighters. Any other animals were not very lucky. It was very sad. We need to do more to protect animals,11/13/1996 11:56
1227,1308, oh wow. Here in Iowa we don't really see fires like that. But I agree we do need to protect animals,1/11/1997 15:31
1228,1228, There are so many different kinds of animals in the world. many are going way too. We need to be more like Germany. Have you head of what they are doing?,10/27/2009 20:33
1228,1228, I have not really heard about what they are doing,4/23/1983 17:59
1228,1228, they are projecting the rights of animals by giving them constitutional rights,7/5/2020 10:21
1228,329, that is a really good idea more counties should have that,12/27/2012 21:47
1228,1228, yeah very cool right! We humans come from animals basically. Would you agree?,9/17/1989 22:26
1228,1228, I would agree,3/28/2005 6:00
1228,1228, We have so much of the same DNA and how we used to have so much hair back in the day like over 200000 years ago. That's crazy!,8/21/1995 9:24
1228,1228, I can't it been that long,9/5/2021 22:03
1228,329, could be. Probably is goes all the way back to Africa I've recently learned. We are basically African animals at one point lol,3/9/1978 2:27
1228,1228, I can see that. We sure have come along way since then,3/18/2000 7:13
1229,520, or not lol..... I randomly learned sound can cause fear in humans. That's pretty wild,2/20/1974 5:25
1229,520, I believe that. I know there are some sounds that cause me fear,4/3/1973 7:43
1229,1229, I wonder how that happens. ANy guesses?,7/13/1973 16:21
1229,520, It's got to be something in the sound frequency,12/8/2003 10:54
1229,520, Yea I'm just wondering what is in that which activates a fear in our human emotion. I wonder if we get that from animals??,12/5/2012 22:01
1229,1229, We could have I am sure there are certain sound that cause them to fear,10/3/2002 5:05
1229,520, totally. Interesting conversation,12/7/2013 2:22
1229,520," hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species? ",3/31/2010 18:14
1229,1229," I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002.",8/10/2010 11:22
1229,520," Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals. ",2/18/1976 7:26
1230,507," Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred.",4/9/1989 6:35
1230,1230, Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up. ,5/20/2018 21:41
1230,507," Interesting. There are so many things to learn about animals, especially knowing that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",4/6/2012 7:54
1230,1230, i wonder how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol That is a lot of animals!  i love the discovery channel I watch a lot of animal shows.   Did you know theres a breed of horse that has a fifth speed?  I guess it is called a tolt. ,4/20/1998 6:53
1230,1230, I heard a tolt is speedwalking for a horse. That's pretty funny!,6/7/1991 11:20
1230,1230," That is cool,  horses got places to go!  speed walking is helpful. ",10/20/1980 3:09
1230,507, I can't imagine being allergic to horses. I would be devastated. Apparently Clint Eastwood developed an allergy to them although he has been on horseback in many of his movies.,6/5/1995 2:06
1230,507," Yeah I know right,  hes in so many western movies,  I guess he had to take daily claritin for his allergies!  ",2/21/2020 23:24
1230,1230," Haha. I am glad we get to use horses for leisure these days or for recording movies, haha. Historically they were used in warfare.",10/8/1981 7:04
1230,507, did you hear about the lipizzaner horses?  They are born a dark color and later turn white?  Thats amazing!,12/23/1997 10:14
1231,167," That's totally weird. I had not heard about that. Horses are great runners, but apparently we are the best distance runners.",5/31/1979 0:48
1231,1231, Maybe because we train with the knowledge we have to run far.  Animals just run for fun or because they have to. ,12/2/2009 7:42
1231,1231," Well, that makes sense. We also cannot synthesize vitamin c like plants or animals.",6/6/2009 10:23
1231,1231," Damn defective gene.  Its ok,  forces us to get out in the sun!  ",7/20/1999 13:59
1231,167," And drink lots of lemonade, yum. Haha.",8/5/2022 12:26
1231,167," Yes,  so refreshing!  ",1/27/1987 23:10
1231,1231, PETA feels strongly about animals and says their treatment is a social justice issue. We keep learning how intelligent and sensitive animals are and so it kind of is but sometimes they can go too far.,10/6/1979 14:59
1231,167, Yeah I feel very strongly about animals too. ,12/31/2009 8:54
1231,167, It's good that PETA teaches people to be kind of animals.,7/9/1986 11:21
1231,167," Hi, do you like animals?",12/1/1972 11:30
1232,787, I do like them cant believe there are 20 quintillion animals out there,11/11/1986 18:38
1232,787, I was surprised that a white patch develops when animals are domesticated. Maybe that's why married men go grey...,5/18/1976 22:35
1232,787," Thats funny, that would make sense, animals have constitutional rights in Germany",3/18/1978 1:55
1232,787, Did you know that hiccups are an early evolution from land animals.,6/10/2000 22:56
1232,787," I guess we are all animals and another fact that supports evolution, ",6/16/1995 7:25
1232,1232, Did you hit enter prematurely?!?!? I do that more than I would like to admit. I wonder what the loch ness monster evolved from.,7/19/1974 14:55
1232,1232," I did, I hate it when that happens, and I have no idea, good thing Nessie is a protected species. Since 1912 at least.",9/18/1976 5:59
1232,1232, How long do loch ness monsters live for? How many are there? I have questions! I do not need answers though. I would like to know more about a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. I have enemies I need to vanquish!,5/10/1997 10:20
1232,787," Well Nessie is a myth, hopefully one day we can find out if the myth is true or not, and thats sounds interesting didnt know there was a fear frequency for humans.",1/7/2000 14:24
1232,1232," Me either. Did you know we may have lost all of our body hair as recently as 240000 years ago? As a swimmer, I still see a lot of hairy humans!",12/2/2012 7:29
1233,1233," I guess many of them didnt lose it lol, there are some hairy humans out there I agree with you",3/30/1989 8:35
1233,46, Did you know ribs grew back? That's crazy! How come other bones don't grow back? I broke my arm and that didn't grow back.,9/1/1992 16:06
1233,1233," I didnt know that, how long does it take for them to grow back? and that sounds painful",4/16/1987 19:27
1233,1233, I wonder if they regrow in other animals like horses?,12/14/2004 7:05
1233,1233," Not sure about that, but that is an intersting question do you like horses?",2/2/2018 19:29
1233,46, I do like horses but I am a little afraid of them. Do you like them?,10/11/1974 8:16
1233,1233," I do, specially Icelandic horses, unique species with a fifth speed",3/18/2016 23:23
1233,46," Is that a speedwalking speed? I only have 2 speeds, slow and nothing.",10/31/2003 11:40
1233,1233," Yeah thats speedwalking for a horse, Clint Eastwood is alergic to horses, I guess he doesnt like them that much",7/12/2007 18:02
1233,1233, They do have big scary teeth. Nice chatting with you!,5/6/1981 16:07
1234,1395," Hi, how are you?",3/27/2003 2:53
1234,1234, Fine. What about you ?,8/1/2013 16:44
1234,1395," I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you like horses?",10/19/1986 16:56
1234,1395, Yes. Horses species are evolved over 40 to 55 million years ago. Human domesticated horses for many purpose like travelling and carrying goods.,5/14/1970 1:26
1234,1234, I like horses too!  I hear that the only true wild horses are the Przewalski's horse.  Did you know that?,11/13/1982 4:41
1234,1395," Its very interesting. Horses mainly used in riding, agriculture and competition purpose. In olden days it is used in warfare and travelling. It speedy escaped from its predators.",10/2/1973 15:08
1234,1395," Yes, I agree with you about that!  On a side note, do you know that there are about 20 quintillion animals on planet Earth?",2/13/1993 17:40
1234,1395," Iceland horses have fifth speed, they are basically speed walking horses it very difficult to run in ice.",11/14/2005 3:23
1234,1234," That's funny, I've seen those little horses and they are too cute!",4/18/1971 2:20
1234,1234," They are pony. When they are big use it for riding. Lipizzaner horses, known for their classical performances.",8/17/1987 15:34
1235,1944," Speaking of the Lipizzaner horses, did you know it takes about 6 years for them to turn white?  They are either born totally brown or black.",2/2/1994 23:51
1235,1235," Now days, cops are using horses it is very amazing to see it.",9/26/1987 1:16
1235,1944," Yes, it is. I read that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.",10/5/1974 17:51
1235,1944, Germany became first country in the world to constitutionally guaranteed legal rights.,5/28/1974 16:01
1235,1944," That's right.  Did you know under the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, The Loch Ness monster is a protected species?",5/4/2015 3:20
1235,1944, If destroy any species can cause the breaking in the food web. It affect the eco-system very much so only the government take steps to protect them. we should also try to protect it.,4/23/2010 2:32
1235,1235," Yes, we all have a responsibility to help keep the animals safe.",9/15/2009 6:58
1235,1235, We should plant trees also it provide space for birds also.,3/19/2000 6:41
1235,1944," So true, my friend!  It has been estimated that there are over 7 million different animal species on Earth!",6/20/1990 10:55
1235,1944, Very interesting. The study of animals is called zoology. It is used to deal with animal disease also.,10/2/2021 23:28
1236,296," You're correct.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!",9/30/2016 17:29
1236,1236, Did you know animals are multicellular ekaryotic organisms?,6/6/2014 10:44
1236,1236," No didnt know that, but there are 20 quintillion of them in our planet",4/3/2009 23:21
1236,1236, Really there are over 1.5 million living animal species that have been documented.  And animals develop white patches on their head when they are domesticated.,8/24/2009 8:15
1236,1236," Thats a cool fact I wonder why, my dog doesnt have that patch, I might have to look at him closer, incredible how evolution acted on us, on species",4/17/1975 4:11
1236,296, Yea it is interesting I wonder why we dont have it as well as I feel like we have basically domesticated ourselves. ,10/10/1996 16:56
1236,296, Thats a valid point did you hear about the Loch Ness Monster and his status as a protected species,12/4/2014 17:50
1236,1236," Yea it's really strange.  It's really sad to think that so many horses died in war, so much more than humans.  War is so cruel.",12/4/1976 17:17
1236,296," It was a cruel war for horses, many, I hear Islandic horses have a fifth speed, ",6/12/1999 2:50
1236,296, That is interesting.  Horses were a powerful force in shaping our history.  We harnessed their power to change the world.,6/3/1995 21:22
1237,1237," They were the tool to our rise in power, did you ever watch Clint Eastwood movies? he appaers in horses in fome of them, apparently his alergic to them",7/27/1985 18:41
1237,915, I have watched some.  He makes good movies.  Have you ever ridden a horse before? It is quite difficult.,9/23/2005 13:50
1237,1237," No, never had the chance, but it must be difficult and scary at first, Dalmatians calm and protect horses, I love dogs",8/26/2013 17:56
1237,915, Dogs are important to us too.  Did you know two students rode theire horses to school and got suspended?,3/19/1990 10:35
1237,915," Thats funny I did hear about that story, A on creativity and A+ on the prank, ",5/4/1977 19:39
1237,1237, Did you know homo sapies came from Africa?,10/28/2013 9:10
1237,1237," No I didnt know that, as humans we began to show evidence of behavioral moderrnity around 50,000 years ago",7/15/2012 18:11
1237,1237, Did you know hickups are leftover evolutionary behavior from when early lands animals had gills and lungs.,9/11/1992 16:31
1237,1237," No I didnt know that humans are an interesting specie, we can regrow ribs in just 2-3 months and they will be as strong as the original ones",8/25/2014 20:55
1237,915, Wait we can regrow whole ribs?,6/29/2014 7:58
1238,1399," Yeah we can, in just 2 to 3 months, ribs that have been surgically shortened",4/20/2021 7:02
1238,1399, That is interesting.,3/16/2001 7:05
1238,1238, What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons?,5/12/1996 0:28
1238,1399, I enjoy remakes if they are done well. ,1/21/2002 2:43
1238,1399, I think Disney is planning to remake the Lion King.  Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake.,11/9/1977 8:44
1238,1238, That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation.,8/17/1999 20:33
1238,1399," I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture",10/1/2022 5:25
1238,1399, I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes.,12/13/2010 15:15
1238,1399," Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book. ",8/15/1976 0:00
1238,1238," Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI.",4/4/1996 21:00
1239,1994," Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies",1/14/2001 5:38
1239,1994," That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs.",3/2/2011 7:28
1239,1994, Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.,10/11/1976 7:08
1239,1239, Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release.,8/10/1993 8:20
1239,1239, Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel. ,8/26/2007 1:35
1239,1239, I was. Disney has made some major moves lately but acquiring the much more adult properies of Marvel Studios was a bold move to me.,3/14/2013 2:47
1239,1994, Yeah Bold but incredible lucrative. They certainly have their eye on the future.  ,9/25/1978 3:37
1239,1994, True. They will make a lot of money off the films but even more in merchandise. They are also adding a Marvel Land to Disneys California Adventure that will be a big money maker for them.,10/14/1970 23:02
1239,1239, Yeah i considerate a smart but gutsy play as you said. On another note did you know that Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total,9/9/2014 5:44
1239,1239, That's hard to imagine so many unknown species. I wonder where the estimate comes from.,6/16/1982 9:16
1240,1966," Speaking of animals In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",2/6/2002 21:37
1240,1966, I think that is much needed. All countries should honor and respect animal rights. Scotland has declared the Loch Ness monster a protected species.,9/3/1982 13:16
1240,1240, I agree i just hate it when animal lives some how trump human ones. nice talking to you,10/31/2003 12:42
1240,1966, I'm not sure I've seen many situations where that occurs. It was nice talking to you as well.,4/26/1985 3:05
1240,1966, Last bit of info about animals is there are about 20 Quintilian individual animals on planet earth.,10/7/1999 2:27
1240,1966, Interesting. Hope you have a good rest of your day!,8/4/1984 19:58
1240,1240, Do you often use the computer?,6/20/1997 12:54
1240,1966, Yes i do!,1/11/2015 14:55
1240,1966, It is amazing how far computers have come and how much a difference computers make for a device that simply carries out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations,8/11/2011 3:57
1240,1966," yeah, i so agree!   And with all that technology, Google built their first computer with the housing being made out of legos.",4/21/2002 1:37
1241,1241, Computers can be made of anything. Russians made a computer that ran on water and someone built a working 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks!,4/13/1986 19:57
1241,1521, Yep... and Disney definitely takes advantage of the computer making CGI movies,3/21/2017 15:48
1241,1521, Indeed. Hollywood too have been remaking beloved classics with new CGI technology and overall better technology thanks to computers,4/12/2009 8:04
1241,1521, and we definitely benefit from it all as consumers!,4/14/2018 7:40
1241,1241, I am looking forward to the disney lion king's remake of the 1994 classic,5/3/1994 20:08
1241,1521, yeah me too... but i am classic kind of person though!  should be interesting seeing it done in cgi though!,5/6/1983 16:31
1241,1521, What do you think of live action remakes?,1/21/1981 3:15
1241,1241, They are ok... like i said... much prefer the old school classics!,6/16/1991 21:50
1241,1521, I wonder if that is because that is what we grew up with and are nostalgic or if they are simply better in quality?,9/11/2013 16:25
1241,1521, yeah I am sure... I think the computer kind of takes away from the true art form,2/21/2012 3:57
1242,1413, Who knows? Maybe one day we will reach a point were there won't be any distinction between films that rely on CGI painted performance and animated filmed that rely on photorealistic effects,11/20/1980 12:13
1242,1242, That is scary.... human action will never truly be replaced!,10/30/1998 1:28
1242,1242, Well transhumanists want to upload their minds into computers,6/14/2010 8:02
1242,1413," That's just weird... but the way computers are going, it will definitely happen.",4/21/2002 9:16
1242,1413, I agree that the future is limitless. In any case thank you for the enjoyable chat. Who know maybe in the future our minds will be in these computers?,10/6/1983 13:32
1242,1242, well computers keep getting better,6/2/2009 0:12
1242,1413, I concur. I hope you have a wonderful day.,12/27/1983 0:18
1242,1242," Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ?",3/29/1981 0:12
1242,1242," I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago.",12/26/1973 14:42
1242,1242, wow ;) we had fur ? ;),4/10/1990 23:46
1243,1243, What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal?,7/16/1993 6:31
1243,662," no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ?",9/7/1978 10:41
1243,1243," Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate.",3/16/1980 7:13
1243,1243, ok... I've never thought about it this way...,3/23/1984 1:41
1243,1243," I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves.",4/6/2002 12:33
1243,662, We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :),10/6/2000 20:45
1243,662," We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals).",11/19/1972 1:08
1243,1243," Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :)",1/31/2007 8:39
1243,1243," I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue!",9/26/2005 20:13
1243,1243, ...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals...,12/10/2014 10:05
1244,1244, Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference.,7/26/1991 11:25
1244,1244," Interesting... but You can't really say they are smarter than us ;) we may be more evil, but we are still smarter :)",8/19/1998 13:29
1244,133," What do you think qualifies (or rather, quantifies) our intelligence?",4/1/2018 21:25
1244,1244, what do You mean ? No other animal can understand math on level we can...,4/25/2006 17:58
1244,1244," What do we use math to understand? Quantity and calculations? How do you think animals know how much food to store for winter, or which directions to migrate, or how to account for tides when navigating in the ocean?",5/23/2019 12:51
1244,133," sure they are not stupid, but they won't build a computer processor...",6/3/2018 15:25
1244,1244," Why do they need a computer processor? Animals have survived and thrived without electricity or any of the modern conveniences humans consider essential to our survival. I think the real sign of intelligence is the ability to not only survive but thrive in the face of challenges, and animals (excluding homo sapiens) have not only succeeded but excelled in doing so - all without damaging the Earth/locations for other species.",9/28/1996 13:15
1244,1244," we don't talk about what they need or not, but about a fact they won't be able to build one because they don't understand high level calculations....",6/10/1981 1:53
1244,1244, Why build what you don't need? Perhaps they have their own versions of technology. I don't think you can quantify or even compare human intelligence to that of the rest of the animal kingdom.,7/1/1997 1:01
1244,133, Do you like horror films?,7/13/1981 13:12
1245,1245," Not crazy about them unless they're real good like Steven King's Misery, but I think that's more thriller.",1/22/1999 20:25
1245,1693, Probably!  You see  the first horror film that stephen king saw?,8/21/2011 8:31
1245,1245, Yes lol.  bambi  funny.  Far cry from what he writes today.,12/30/1978 16:47
1245,1245, Yeah... bambi was pretty scary though for a cartoon... so was Dumbo too!,6/10/2019 14:52
1245,1693, Maybe that's why boy from the shining didn't know he was acting in a horror firm.  Now that was down right creepy.,1/23/2017 16:53
1245,1245, Holy cow!  REally?  That is creepy... but imagine how he felt once hee saw the film?,5/14/2019 15:58
1245,1245, Was reading the section on animals.  There are about 20 quintillion of them.  What a number.  That's even higher then the national debt!!lol,11/18/2014 14:25
1245,1693, Hahahaaaa... now that's funny!  That is a high number... but give it time... it will get there!  LOL,8/3/2008 20:45
1245,1245, That's the first I've heard that number.  How about hiccups being a holdover when animals had both gills and lungs.  Weird.,7/8/2012 16:50
1245,1245, That is interesting for sure!  Love that the Lochness monster is a protected species!,9/5/1989 15:30
1246,1012, Gonna have to remember that one.  And maybe shave my dog's head to see if she has a white patch on her forehead!!,4/14/1971 15:28
1246,1012, really?  I don't know if i buy into that!,4/21/2003 12:55
1246,1012, Thats one for google.  All my dog and cat lover friends I think I'll starting calling them ailurophiles or cynophiles and see the looks they get on their faces.,10/1/1998 19:12
1246,1246, Well... i would surely give you a look of what the....  Funny the first cloned animal was a cat and they named it copy cat!,1/17/1973 10:52
1246,1012," That's clever actually.  Although I think cloning is weird.  I wonder why you don't own pets but are guardians in boulder, co.",9/25/2016 8:26
1246,1246, Because they are a weird state and don't believe in owning anything that is alive,7/18/1975 1:46
1246,1012, OH..makes sense I guess. I always was a aware thatTeddy Roosevelt had a bear and hyena.  Didn't know he had over 20 pets though.  Now he was a weird one too,5/2/1989 17:44
1246,1246, That's true... and what the heck does one person do with that many pets?!?,6/4/2002 12:26
1246,1012, Let them chase the white house aides around!!  ,2/22/2005 9:52
1246,1012, hahaaaaaa... great chat!  have a good one!,12/1/1991 7:24
1247,1247, Are you a fan of horror movies?,4/30/1978 9:01
1247,338, Yes I like some of them. Do you know which movies Stephen King thinks is the scariest?,12/14/2011 12:15
1247,338, Yes he thinks it is Bambi the one with the deer cartoon,6/3/1979 6:31
1247,1247, Yes I guess the scene where the mom is killed can be scary,11/28/1984 4:11
1247,1247, I guess so. Did you know you burn more calories watching them?,4/26/1983 12:32
1247,338, Yes about 180 more calories than regular movies,9/15/2011 0:48
1247,338, I know. But there is good in watching horror movies too,4/15/1985 12:48
1247,338, Yes it is good to watch them before you go to an art gallery with abstract art,7/5/2011 16:08
1247,1247," Yes as you enjoy it more, the brain is amazing",6/9/2004 22:16
1247,338, Yes it is. Do you know how they make the creepy noises in those movies?,2/1/2011 17:02
1248,1104, Yes there is an instrument called a waterphone that they use,4/13/1999 21:52
1248,1104, Yes it is just too scary for my taste,11/9/1981 21:35
1248,1248, Mine too. Do you like animals?,5/14/1989 4:13
1248,1104, I love them. Do you know how many are there?,5/13/1990 0:32
1248,1248, Yes about 20 quintillion but do not ask me how many zeroes are in that,6/23/1980 14:59
1248,1248, Haha me too. Do you have any domesticated animals?,5/9/2009 3:04
1248,1104, Yes a cat and I hear they usually develop white patches on the forehead but mine does not have one,12/4/2001 5:55
1248,1104," Mine does not either, I have a small dog. I wonder how valid this is",4/12/1973 4:13
1248,1104, Me too. Did you know the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species?,8/12/1988 1:55
1248,1104," Yeah and no one has ever seen it, go figure. Nice chat!",12/29/2019 23:32
1249,1249, Same here and have a good one,8/15/1980 1:00
1249,1878," did you know Stephen king was terrified as a child when he saw the movie bambi, calling it the first horror movie he saw.",12/6/1980 20:58
1249,1249," Yes, it's crazy that watching calories can burn more than 180 calories",11/23/1977 14:56
1249,1878, i need to start watching morw scary movies haha i seen a thing called a waterline makes up most of the creepy sounds in horror films. How cool is that.,7/7/1987 16:30
1249,1878," I had no idea, I find it so funny that the boy from the shining had no idea he was acting in a horror movie until many years later",2/28/2011 20:57
1249,1249, they do that alot with very young actors!,9/18/1979 19:12
1249,1249," I had no idea, but I'm sure that would make sense since they're young and don't really know what is happening",7/23/2015 4:06
1249,1878, and that way they won't be scared so much. i think it would be good.,8/9/1976 8:07
1249,1249," Have you ever heard that it is not legal to own pets in boulder, CO? You can be their guardian though, whatever that means!",4/29/1990 0:11
1249,1249, oh wow that's odd. i wish i could have studied zoology more in college!,10/31/1998 16:24
1250,1250, Me too! Also Theodore roosevelt had a ton of pets like a bear and a hyena,3/8/1996 9:41
1250,1250," that's cool!!!  i just read Under the provisions of the 1912 scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species. ......how cool is that!!!",7/8/2017 22:11
1250,1250," That is awesome! Never would have heard of that. In Germany in 2002 they became the first country to give animals constitunonal legal rights, crazy!",4/1/1987 3:07
1250,1250, that is crazy haha! So cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile!,2/13/1984 6:09
1250,1250, I wonder why I never learned any of that in school!,1/18/2015 8:34
1250,1250, in kind of wondering the same thing!  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat lol so funny ,4/26/2005 14:12
1250,1250," that is funny, I can't believe there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia! I've never met anyone that has a pet tiger",7/15/1996 15:49
1250,1859, i haven't either. that would be a bit scary!  Did you know There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth? ,1/8/2014 16:22
1250,1250, I'm not even sure that i know how many quintillion is to be honest.. I think its so crazy that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. I wonder how that even works??,3/22/1975 2:53
1250,1250, it's alot haha and yeah i don't know how the whole dot thing would work either. that's so odd!,2/28/1972 13:16
1251,992," That is odd, im going to have to look that one up for sure. Also insane how there are more pets in japan than children under 15? I would assume there would be billions of children there. ",5/22/2005 17:23
1251,1251, wow what weird rules there are. thanks for the chat :) Bye now,1/19/2011 3:43
1251,1251, Do you have a pet?,9/12/2018 19:05
1251,992, I have a dog.  I used to have two dogs and two cats.,9/12/1984 3:33
1251,1251," I love dogs, what is your dogs name?",11/16/1980 4:59
1251,1251, Popcorn.  She kept jumping when she saw us for the first time at the rescue center.,5/6/1988 18:06
1251,1251, awww that is so cute! What kind of dog is it.,7/19/2004 21:11
1251,1251, Australian shepherd.,2/28/2015 2:49
1251,992," I love those dogs, my brother has one, his name is Rogue. Amazing animals. Pets are great, I used to have a rat terrier named Rocky",3/25/1980 12:29
1251,992," Apparently, hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs.",2/10/1994 16:39
1252,1252," wow that is crazy to think. I wish we still had gills, it would make swimming more enjoyable lol",7/4/1985 17:17
1252,1252," I agree.   Apparently, loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland.",5/25/2019 12:53
1252,1252," no way! the loch ness is one of 20 quintillion animals on earth, if it is real, are you a believer?",9/26/2013 22:33
1252,582, I'm not sure.  Apparently Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two groups.,4/24/1970 2:36
1252,1252," I wonder how he divided them, do you know?",1/28/2017 7:28
1252,582, Animalia (multicellular) and Protozoa (single cell),7/25/1981 19:41
1252,582," wow, you think they would have more than that lol. Crazy, speaking of pets though I just remembered the boulder it is not legal to own a pet, but instead be the guardian, how do you feel a bout that",8/19/1975 0:49
1252,582," It's rather strange, I must say.",10/22/1996 18:51
1252,1252," Yea, it is not like they can consent to anything or make their own decision mostly. I don't know, I think boulder is kind of strange area too lol",8/17/2010 15:40
1252,1252," I have never been there.  Most of pets are used by humans as company, protection and entertainment.  Some people use pets as working animals.",8/27/2008 23:18
1253,133," Here is a crazy fact to end with. There are more tigers living as pets in the USA than living wild in asia, very interesting. It was so great chatting with you!",10/27/2002 0:59
1253,1253," Wow, I did not know that.  Nice chatting with you too.",3/16/2006 19:17
1253,1253, Have a great weekend!,1/24/2019 1:40
1253,1253, Hey have you ever seen the movie show dogs? You think it's appropriate for kids,8/9/2005 1:34
1253,133," It has been awhile, but I know it is said to be kid friendly. Are you a dog fan?",7/8/1998 5:42
1253,1253," Yes I love dogs, I love how they are Man's Best Friend, what about you?",1/17/2005 7:13
1253,1253, Definitely a dog person. According to Google's code of conduct they state they are a dog company.,7/13/2008 15:35
1253,1253," Well that's good to know! Also good to know that dogs are not actually colorblind, they only can see limited colors though oh, that makes me feel better",3/21/1989 19:18
1253,1253, I know! It goes against all I was ever taught!! Dogs really are great. They were the first species to be domesticated.,12/5/1998 10:00
1253,133," Yep that's impressive! Also impressive that they have 12 different blood types, I wonder if they do dog blood drives",7/3/1978 2:36
1254,885, I have heard that they do. Dogs do take on some pretty amazing roles for humans from hunting and herding to companionship and coming to the aid of disabled people.,4/3/2007 20:19
1254,1254," Yes dogs are so nice and also useful for helping humans, I also like how istanbul has trained dogs to grab the trash in their city in exchange for treats",7/31/1980 7:11
1254,885," Oh, that's great! Dogs are so smart. I know dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.",12/2/2004 22:36
1254,885," Yes you're right, I wonder if gorillas can understand that or if they can't? What do you think about movies with dogs? I would like dog comedies myself like the movie Isle of dogs",12/14/2014 5:26
1254,885, I think they're cute. I have not seen that one.,6/22/2021 21:03
1254,885," Yeah it's actually really good. I like a lot of comedies, especially the movie Kung Fu Hustle",11/2/1980 2:26
1254,885, I don't think I've heard of that. I see a lot of action movies like Deadpool since I have boys that are older.,3/19/2016 20:12
1254,885," Yes I like Deadpool, I didn't really care for Deadpool 2 but it was ok, what did you think",1/17/1977 19:22
1254,1254, Deadpool 2 is pretty bloody and raunchy with a lot of references to pop culture that I'm not sure my teen understood.,9/2/1980 17:31
1254,885," It's definitely a movie more for adults, did you see that Ryan Reynolds actually does the voice of the mystery villain in that movie though? I will want to watch Deadpool 3 at some point",9/29/2012 23:51
1255,71," No, I did not. I'll have to check it out.  I do like that DP2 was targeted toward adults so maybe 3 will do the same. It makes it more tolerable.",2/9/1972 20:43
1255,71," Yes it's definitely going to Target adults, did you hear that James Cameron and David Fincher both were instrumental in getting the first Deadpool movie made",11/15/1987 9:13
1255,71," No, I had no idea. What did they do?",10/7/1995 13:49
1255,1255," They just kept petitioning the studio which was 20th Century Fox to go forward with the project, they felt it would be a success",5/21/1976 19:07
1255,1255," hi, do you like dogs?",5/5/1993 9:07
1255,1255, Hi and yes i love dogs!  I like how they are related to wolves.  I wonder what their original ancestor was like.  Do you like dogs?,2/19/1983 11:58
1255,1255," I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood",10/29/1994 4:41
1255,71, I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.  ,3/31/2014 0:43
1255,71, yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives,8/4/2013 3:53
1255,71, Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could.,7/17/1984 21:37
1256,1256, Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul?,11/9/2018 16:35
1256,1909, I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles.,4/16/2014 15:17
1256,1256," yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment",4/29/1989 13:23
1256,1256," I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing.",4/26/2007 17:15
1256,1909," that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs",7/30/2004 22:21
1256,1256, I am glad to hear that for some reason!  I like knowing that one of my favorite sites to use likes dogs. I am surprised though that they have taken a stand regarding it.,2/1/1999 18:13
1256,1256, yeah it is in their code of conduct even,10/5/2021 16:25
1256,1909, Pretty impressive!  I will tell you something equally as impressive.  I know for a fact that dogs watch television.  They are not colorblind and they understand a great many of our words.,1/24/1971 2:43
1256,1909, yeah they just see less colors than we do,1/27/1989 3:44
1256,1909, They have had such a long history of association with humans thought that they understand human behavior.,12/12/1976 1:57
1257,1969," yeah exactly, they are known as our best friends after all",9/29/1979 2:44
1257,1969, Yes they are.  It's weird to me that they can thrive on a starch rich diet.  It seems like they would prefer to have meat.,4/25/2014 4:21
1257,1257," yeah, it is their diet from the wild so that makes sense",9/21/2014 0:54
1257,1969," Now that you mention it, it does. I have seen stray dogs that have been dumped by people eat corn and grass in fields before.  It's sad that people dump dogs, especially when they can do so many different things.  Dogs are not only great hunters but are also great in therapy roles as well.",7/4/1989 16:04
1257,1257," They sure are, we must be grateful to have them around. nice chat",11/8/1972 16:34
1257,1257, Hello,10/20/2019 23:15
1257,1969, Hello. Do you know the dog as the first species to be domesticated?,12/13/2001 9:02
1257,1257, I did.  Had a discussion with a friend of mine about it last week.  They are all a bunch of little wolves. ,11/21/1989 21:17
1257,1257, Their ancestry does go back to the wolf but dogs are more suited for human companionship.,2/9/2004 12:48
1257,1969," Yeah, they took a notion to getting access to food.  Cats never really changed, they are still just cats.  Mini lions and tigers, really.",9/4/2005 9:33
1258,1258, My own dog is good for hunting and for protection. I have a Boston.,10/10/2014 18:16
1258,1643, Then your dog would be welcome at Google.  They are apparently anti-cat there.,4/7/1971 11:34
1258,1258, I heard that as well. Dogs are the perfect companion and well behaved if trained properly.,12/15/2007 4:53
1258,1643, I had honestly never heard of Dog Blood Drives until today.  I really did not know that was a thing.,1/17/1997 20:42
1258,1643, I found it surprising that dogs have 12 different blood types. My dog has never donated blood.,5/26/1987 9:46
1258,1258," Here's my thing.  People say that only dogs and elephants understand pointing.  Okay, that's fine, but what about apes, monkeys and corvids?  They are all relatively smart, as animals go.  Seems to me that there would be some inherent pointing in there somewhere.",10/21/1977 5:00
1258,1643, I would agree that that point is hard to believe. I know apes and monkeys are able to point as well. ,11/5/2005 2:04
1258,1258, The not being color blind part is interesting as well.  I had always been taught that dogs just see in shades of grey.  ,9/17/2022 2:17
1258,1643, I need to start one of the vending businesses to provide stray animals with food and water in exchange for recyclables. Great idea!,10/4/1999 12:17
1258,1258," It is a cool idea.  Too bad the animals can't pay for it though.  I know that crows understand barter, but I dunno about the rest of them.  It doesn't seem super profitable.",4/22/1979 20:35
1259,421, I would do it just to repay dogs for all the companionship they provide to the disabled. They are truly man's best friend in my book.,1/25/1998 8:24
1259,1259, You do make a really good point.  I haven't seen Deadpool 2 yet. I sure do hope there are dogs in it.,12/15/1986 23:22
1259,1259, Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing in Dead Pool. The movie is immensely popular,8/23/2012 11:16
1259,1259, It sounds like it.  We are really looking forward to seeing it.  It sounds like a great comedy film.,10/30/2021 3:27
1259,1259, It is hard to believe that it is already the 11th installment in the series by 20th Century FOx,8/15/2001 14:54
1259,421," Yeah, they have done REALLY well with the franchise.  I'm excited for what comes next.",9/18/2012 0:52
1259,421, Dogs or cats?,4/17/1990 6:57
1259,1259," Dogs of course, you?",1/18/2007 6:57
1259,1259, Dog for sure all day! Even google likes dogs more,5/13/1994 12:03
1259,1259," Yeah they are a dog company, and thats  a great thing, I love dogs,",3/3/1989 11:30
1260,209," Me too, do you have a dog?",11/15/2008 23:32
1260,209," I have a dog, a golden retriever, do you? interesting how they can have up to 12 different types of blood",9/7/2007 21:10
1260,1260," I have a rat terrier, I love him so much. His name is rocky and he is a boss! i did not know that about the blood, I wonder if they have blood drives",10/19/1990 9:58
1260,1260," There are also blood drives for dogs yes, and sounds like a cute little fellow, ",3/5/2018 7:59
1260,209," What! He is awesome, getting old though but lots of good memories. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only ones that respond to pointing. My dog loves that",8/8/2019 3:19
1260,209," I didnt know that, I guess both are really smart animals, dogs can also see color so that makes them kind of unique ",1/2/2003 20:28
1260,1260, For sure! Did you ever see Deadpool 2?,7/1/2011 19:59
1260,209," I did, that movie was so fun, I really liked it, did you like it?",10/6/1980 10:43
1260,1260, It was actually really good. I liked lady luck! Do you like comedy films?,9/5/1972 19:00
1260,1260," I do like them yea, one of my favorite actors is Bill Murray",7/25/2012 21:35
1261,1261," Me too, I love me some Bill Murray movies, have you seen Kung Fu Hustle?",10/16/1970 17:28
1261,1261," I have seen it yeah, why do you ask?",1/13/2018 4:32
1261,1261," Was it comedy gold like Bill Murray said it was, or was he being sarcastic?",1/14/2001 15:11
1261,1824," It was comedy, I liked it, but I wouldnt call it the supreme achievement, I think he was sarcastic when he said that",11/11/1970 10:04
1261,1824," lol, that is so like Bill Murray. It was so nice talking with you!",8/18/2001 1:06
1261,1824," He is a grea actor, I like him as well, another great actor is Ryan Stiles, so funny",12/9/1971 12:13
1261,1824," For sure, that guy never graduated high school. Look how far he has come! Have a great day! Give you dog some hugs for me!",10/27/2009 13:27
1261,1261," That sounds like a hard call, not going to high school to persue a carreer in comedy and I will, you do the same with yours. ",8/25/1981 21:31
1261,1261, I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts.,6/21/1992 14:42
1261,1261," Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.  ",2/26/2016 16:34
1262,1262, Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election,8/5/1981 15:03
1262,315," That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our frenemies  do the same thing and we do it to them, too.",7/21/1986 12:20
1262,315, Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies.,10/23/2021 14:03
1262,1262," On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics.",3/22/1978 17:37
1262,315, Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans!,7/21/1984 13:19
1262,1262," You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that!",6/26/1971 12:57
1262,1262, Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853,12/10/1991 7:10
1262,315," Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame.",3/10/1982 4:42
1262,315, Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican,7/21/1981 18:49
1262,315," Well, that's a Southern/ Texas thing, a beard and that is the base for the Republicans, so that makes perfect sense to me. But, I usually look at the taller candidate, they seem to win 75% of the time, so maybe the Dems should be looking for them a giant?",3/20/1994 11:14
1263,1263, That is a good point.  Beto O'Rourke is crazy tall - maybe he will win.   I think Nevada has the right plan - they have a none of these candidates option on their ballot,10/27/2018 10:26
1263,1263," Or do what the officials in Ancient Athens did and appoint by lottery.  It you get picked, you get picked, do the job, and then move on and let the next one be picked to serve.  Probably more fair of a way than all the BIG money being pumped by both sides.",11/15/2003 21:18
1263,1263, I agree.  Though I might go for term limits other a true lottery - I can think of a lot of my friends who I would not want making decisions in the government!,5/27/2004 20:18
1263,1263," Oh, I got a few of them kind as well, friend.  I didn't realize that in the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.  I wonder if the CIA knew about that?  Maybe they were trying to pull something to affect our elections?",9/22/1991 9:54
1263,1833, Yes there has been some craziness over the years.  I mean one year the ballot counting in Florida was stopped by the brother of the guy running for President - how would that have looked if it had happened in Africa or somewhere?  Fishy?,6/8/1983 22:07
1263,1833," You know I'm from Florida and I love the Bush family.  They are good people and I remember them elections well, all we heard on mainstream media was this county here is majority Democrats, but how is it that 90% voted for the Republican candidate.  We're all registered Democrats, but vote Republican.",2/7/1977 15:15
1263,1263," Why register Democrat then?    By 2000, the Republican party has firmly aligned with Christian conservatism, and has its chief support from the south, the great plains and the mountain states.",9/5/1982 1:49
1263,1263," Once a great while ago, the Democrats did represent us, though it no longer does now. Me for example if I want to have more opportunities to vote in Local elections, I have to be registered how the majority of the candidates are registered as.  So, if only Democrat candidates are running, well I better be a Democrat for awhile on paper and switch back after the election.  Designation means NOTHING.  Leftists need to learn that lesson.  Everybody knows the coast and big cities are Democrats and rural south and heartland states are Republicans.",7/20/1993 7:30
1263,1263, Absolutely.  I have voted in Republican primaries in Texas for the most moderate candidate before.,7/31/1993 3:59
1263,1263, Hey do you ever play video games? Have you ever played the game The Thin silence,9/7/1990 21:36
1264,277, hi how are you? i used to play video games. The Thin Silence? i havent heard of it.,1/29/1983 3:18
1264,277," Yes apparently it's being developed by Two PM Studios, it sounds really crazy it uses the look of videogames from the 80's",6/19/2015 14:11
1264,1264, What? the 80s? like NES and stuff?  Why? seems odd.,5/23/1974 11:16
1264,277, Yes I think so! Do you play any video games by the way?,8/1/1979 4:58
1264,277," i used to play a long long time ago. havent played recently. the systems look cool, but i dont have the time LOL",3/10/1986 16:05
1264,1264, Yeah I hear you on that haha. It's funny that initially video games were called cathode ray tube Amusement devicesLOL that sucks all the fun out of them,1/24/1974 12:05
1264,1264," That is a totally military name. too many words, too official sounding. pointless.",8/23/1982 9:25
1264,277, Have you ever visited South Korea? Apparently if you're under 16 it's illegal for you to play video games after midnight haha,9/9/1998 0:09
1264,277, I think that there is a video game craze there. plus there are games cafes that are open all night ,12/10/1989 22:18
1264,277," That sounds pretty cool. Did you ever play a video game based on Toy Story? Apparently Tom Hanks his brother, Jim Hanks, does all of the voices for Woody in the video games",9/24/1975 3:57
1265,1914," that's great. Tom has enough money, and his brother could use the work. how would you like to be his brother? That would be tough, overshadowed by Tom",3/16/1997 16:57
1265,1265," It would be tough but you're still making a lot of money haha. Have you ever played the Harry Potter video games or even LittleBigPlanet? Apparently this guy Stephen Fry does the narration in those games, I bet he also makes a lot of money",3/9/2007 23:31
1265,1914," I have not. Stephen is a tremendous screen talent as well. i dont know how old he is, but he has been around for decades. wrote a book too, i think",7/10/1985 4:12
1265,1914, Oh wow that's cool. Do you like any movie soundtracks by the way? I know we were just talking about Toy Story and that has a good soundtrack,9/12/1970 16:54
1265,1914," Toy Story was tremendous. great casting, great characters, great story, great tunes. ",5/24/2008 3:54
1265,1914," Yeah I agree with you. I also like the Jaws soundtrack, the Jaws theme is incredible! And Steven Spielberg even makes an appearance on the soundtrack because he plays the clarinet on it LOL",4/11/1990 14:41
1265,1914, I did not know that spielberg played the clarinet. thats great. i wonder how many other soundtracks he played on.,1/18/1973 6:27
1265,1914," That's a good question, have you ever seen the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? Apparently it's soundtrack was certified 8 times Platinum",8/1/2013 10:05
1265,1914," Yeah, that was a great film. Clooney sang the song originally. then they found a real singer.",10/27/1983 3:37
1265,1914," Haha you're right! I think Phil Collins is a great singer, he did the soundtrack for Tarzan, and then recorded it in like five different languages, that's impressive in my opinion!",8/15/1991 16:56
1266,1266, hey did you know the Senate used a gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it,5/6/2004 7:48
1266,1266, Hello - no I did not know that. Pretty cool. ,4/5/1973 1:37
1266,1954," ya he ruined it! there is a Candy desk in the senate apparently, sounds delicious!",10/11/1985 0:47
1266,1266, That does sound pretty good! Michael Jordan once responded that republicans buy shoes too so he didn't endorse the democratic candidate. ,6/8/1975 20:50
1266,1266," haha well I wish more people took his advice and kept out of politics, really weird that women couldnt wear pants in the senate until 1993",1/4/1985 0:18
1266,1954, haha yea I was just reading that. Said something about staging a protest wearing pantsuits. ,5/5/2019 23:16
1266,1954, ya it was Barbara Mikulski and Carl Moseley who did a protest by wearing pantsuits,12/11/2011 2:46
1266,1954, That's funny. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853?,3/29/1987 12:50
1266,1266," no that is kind of crazy, also crazy is that only republicans have beards apparently, no democrat presidents have had one",1/23/2006 17:25
1266,1954, Wow that's crazy I had no idea they never have had a beard as a democrat. ,1/31/2003 14:18
1267,1267," no I didn't either, also crazy is that the use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 for repubs and ems",11/8/1982 23:26
1267,1885, Interesting....I didn't know that either. The last republican was elected  president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928.,11/22/1972 5:29
1267,1885," wow, but I think that is outdated information because Trump is now president haha",1/26/1986 12:24
1267,1267, Yea I think so too lol. What are your thoughts on Trump?,1/22/2002 12:21
1267,1885, Eh I don't talk politics but I do think it's funny that Truman wouldn't get a picture taken with Dumbo because he didn't want to be associated with the republican party.,4/7/1987 5:14
1267,1267, haha yea that's funny! I try not to talk politics myself. ,9/13/1994 6:40
1267,1267," yup jost not worth it, did you know that in athens they used to choose elections by just the lottery?",5/13/1970 5:23
1267,1267," That's pretty crazy they used the lottery for elections. I saw that since 1900, the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time.",6/25/1985 10:38
1267,1885," ya so the democrats should maybe run a basketball player in 2020? haha, but ya its scary that in 2012 international election observers were blocked from 9 states",10/21/1974 14:07
1267,1885, HAHA that's a good one!,3/29/1996 2:45
1268,1815," haha, also I think we should all do what nevada does and have a none of these candidates options when we vote",7/6/2020 21:54
1268,1815," Hi, how are you?",6/20/2022 21:33
1268,1815, Not bad.   Do you know anything about Mitch McConnell?,4/14/2009 9:14
1268,1815, I know very little. I used to watch a ton of politics but not any more. Too depressing. What about you?,3/14/1989 16:38
1268,1268, I agree.    The Brett Kavanaugh thing was quite a debacle!,3/10/2022 14:34
1268,1268, Yeah. Unlike the gavel they use for 165 year. That thing was solid!,7/13/1996 7:40
1268,1268, Did you know the Senate still could choose the Vice President if the vote does not results in one candidate with a majority!,11/12/1990 15:08
1268,1815, I did not. I would like to use the obsure rule and arrest enators to vote. Seems like a good plan!,6/25/1972 3:17
1268,1815, A prison with a candy desk cannot be too terrible!,6/17/1985 12:22
1268,1268," Well, it's still a prison. Did you mean Senate? I mean they may be synanyms....",7/24/2012 4:24
1269,3," Yes.    You arrest someone, you take them to prison, whether it is a jail or the Senate!",4/15/2012 6:33
1269,3, HA! I get it now. Im an idiot. Nice joke! ,5/6/2002 4:36
1269,3, Did you know ever president has been a republican or democrat since 1853.,11/9/1995 19:35
1269,1269, Women were not allowed to wear pants until 1993. Sees sexist!,12/5/1979 15:34
1269,3," That is true.  Maybe they did it right in ancient athens, where leaders were appointed by lottery.",6/25/2007 17:26
1269,3, I had no idea that GOP stood for Grand Old Party. Seems like a really old white thing...,6/22/1986 20:51
1269,3," Well, every president with a beard was Republican, so who knows!",8/30/2018 20:58
1269,3, Truman refused to go on the dumbo ride for fear of being pictured on a elephant...,4/1/1993 7:42
1269,1269," Truman was not a tall fellow, so might have trouble in contemporary politics.",5/12/2019 17:47
1269,3, I had no idea that red and blue for parties only started in 2000?,6/17/2004 5:43
1270,334," Yes.    If they changed the colors, do you think voter turnout might surpass 62.8%?",2/17/2020 13:07
1270,1270, Nice chatting with you!,2/5/1996 7:57
1270,1270," Hi, do you enjoy conspiracy theory?",3/12/2014 22:02
1270,1270," Hello - I do enjoy them. Not that I believe most, but they make you think. What about you?",1/13/1976 13:37
1270,334, I do not follow them but I do find humor in them so I will listen. I guess Mitch McConnell is one.,2/14/2012 2:36
1270,334, Same here. Do you know much about the US senate?,2/9/2004 6:10
1270,1270," I know a little. What about you, do you know a lot?",1/22/1971 23:58
1270,334, Just a little. I know Jordan was once asked why he wouldn't endorse black democratic candidate Gantt which Jordan said republicans buy shoes too.,5/25/1971 0:00
1270,1270, That's the kind of leadership I expect from Jordan! They had the same gavel until Richard the Hulk nixon broke it!,8/26/2021 21:04
1270,1270, Me too. Haha that's hilarious he broke it!,11/28/2021 0:59
1271,20, Maybe he had some of that candy from the senate floor!,9/18/2018 13:36
1271,20, Possibly. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans in college?,3/8/2022 15:14
1271,1271, I wonder why she switched?Roosevelt created the bull moose party after being rejected by the GOP.,3/1/2015 7:22
1271,20, Not sure on that. There is a republican vs democrat baseball game every year since 1909.,7/11/1993 0:05
1271,1271," Wow, that's cool but also, shouldn't they worry about the nation? I knew bull moose wouldn't work because every president has been a republic or democrat since 1853.",4/13/2003 7:57
1271,1271, I think so too. The only American president to propose a minimum income was Richard Nixon.,6/7/1982 10:38
1271,1271, Wow. Good trivia. Like every bearded president has been republican.,11/12/1971 17:21
1271,1271, That's interesting too. A dog beat two people in a mayoral election and server as mayor for 13 years.,3/2/2019 18:36
1271,1271, I would feel bad if I were those two! Red and blue were not used until 2000. Seems like that is really recent.,8/3/2011 11:50
1271,1271, That's very recent. I would have never guessed that.,1/13/1974 12:19
1272,1272, I wouldn't have guessed Truman to be insecure but he didn't want to go on the dumbo ride for fear of being associated with republicans.,6/9/2009 18:48
1272,1272, LOL I didn't know he was that insecure.,10/6/2009 9:14
1272,1612, Nice chatting with you!,7/10/2014 22:04
1272,1272, Hi! You play video games? I think it's funny they were intially called cathode ray tube amusement devices!,5/13/2001 8:17
1272,1272, I know I am so glad we switched to just calling them video games,12/5/1998 16:03
1272,1272, Yes so much easier. In South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight. I would have broken the law a lot if I grew up there!,12/4/1996 18:29
1272,1272, Me too and I wonder how they can tell. Do you know who Stephen Fry is?,11/20/1990 2:32
1272,1272," Isn't he that narrator who narrated little big planet, and some other games as well? I thought his name sounded familiar, I would probably recognize his voice. ",2/11/1990 1:04
1272,1272," Yes he did that and the harry potter and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy, such a talent",4/8/2009 6:31
1272,1612, Very cool. Tom Hanks brother voice must sound quite similar because he voices Woody in the video games!,9/11/1982 6:41
1273,335, Cool. Do you know how many hours of video games we play as a planet in a week?,4/10/1996 7:03
1273,335, 3 billion hours! That is so hard to believe but they are so much fun!,3/6/2019 16:53
1273,335, I know they are. Do you listen to soundtracks?,9/3/2019 11:11
1273,335, Yeah I loved the Bohemian Rapsody soundtrack cause Queen is awesome. The Jaws soundtrack was cool and Spielberg actually played the clarinet in the soundtrack!,9/11/2005 16:46
1273,1273, THat guy is so talented. Did you know Phil Collins did the soundtrack for Tarzan in 5 languages?,11/30/2018 4:10
1273,1273," No I only heard it in English! But yeah looks like it was in Italian, German, Spanish, and French! Very cool.",11/25/1998 23:31
1273,1273, I know.Did you know that Duft Punk did the Tron Legacy soundtrack?,12/17/2020 13:43
1273,1273, Yeah I do know that. They negotiated the soundtrack over a pancake breakfast.,5/31/1999 16:52
1273,1273, Yeah pretty cool and they were wearing the robot helmets,9/11/1984 21:50
1273,335, How could they eat with those lol? Each of the track titles on the Batman begins soundtrack is the name of the genus or family of bat.,4/30/2010 0:27
1274,1610," That is so creative actually. Did you know the soundtrack for Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is certified platinum?",5/20/1984 8:52
1274,1274, I loved that soundtrack and movie! Certified 8 times platinum actually. Well it was great talking with you good night.,12/11/1996 11:23
1274,1610," Pretty impressive. Same here, have a good one",1/24/2017 23:54
1274,1610, Bye!,7/31/1996 17:22
1274,1610, hey my friend did you ever see the movie Jaws?,7/8/1976 21:05
1274,1610," I did, I thought it was scary back in the day, what are your thoughts on the movie?",4/29/1992 22:14
1274,1274," oh its scary and its a classic, and I guess the director played the clarinet in the soundtrack",3/5/1979 1:06
1274,1274," Yeah I heard Spielberg played the clarinet, I must say he is pretty good, never imagined it was him",8/16/1996 8:41
1274,1274, did you see the movie o brother where art thou? Directed by the coens?,9/5/2015 18:01
1274,1274," No, I think I didnt watch that one, who is Coens? ",5/11/1994 12:47
1275,732," theyre brothers that direct movies together, but anyway the soundtrack is good it was certified platinum 8 times",9/20/1986 9:11
1275,732," It was pretty good, scary as well, I think the soundtrack is one of the most important factors for the success of the movie",4/18/1985 7:00
1275,1275," oh ya definitely, do you like Phil collins btw?",10/15/2011 22:25
1275,732," I do like him, he recorded the sountrack for Tarzan right?",3/8/1986 11:27
1275,1275," ya he did, in like 5 different foreign languages too, that's impressive!",2/20/2019 3:03
1275,732," It is impressive he must be really smart, that's not an easy feat",1/16/2006 7:15
1275,1275," no I agree, I would definitely have gone right for the professionals, I wouldn't have stayed in college haha",7/4/2018 9:48
1275,1275, Do you like Daft Punk?,4/30/1972 0:53
1275,732," I do actually, didn't they negotiate the tron contract over pancakes? Pretty awesome!",9/7/2007 7:09
1275,1275," Yeah, over a pancake breakbast, Tron Legacy was a great movie and the soundtrack was supreme",9/4/2007 4:39
1276,1276," oh I agree, also crazy is the batman begins soundtrack names its tracks after different types of bats",11/16/2010 7:16
1276,1276," Thats an interesting fact, I love Batman movies and havent noticed that detail, do you play video games?",2/11/2004 7:42
1276,1884," I do, I played the NES up to the Nintendo Switch haha what about you?",12/10/1970 1:43
1276,1276," Same bought the original system and also have a switch now, I'm a Nintendo fan.",1/1/1973 1:46
1276,1276," ya I agree, its crazy though that we as a society play about 3 billion hours of videogames each week",2/15/1996 22:03
1276,1884," That seems like a lot of time wasted, I wonder how Jane Mcgonigal did his calculations.",3/3/2002 1:58
1276,1884," Hi, how are you?",9/18/1995 22:47
1276,1276," Good, thank you - yourself? do you play video games?",5/2/2004 4:12
1276,1884," I am well, thanks for asking. I used to play a lot but I got married and my priorities shifted. What about you?",5/30/2009 15:41
1276,1276, no not really. my kids do though. did you know the creator of atrari made chuckie chese to get kids to play games?,4/24/2019 7:42
1277,30, Really!??? That's so interesting! What a crazy idea to get people to play video games?,1/25/2003 9:12
1277,1277, Video gaming wasn't as big then! I remeber my kids playing mortal kombat. Do you know that why they started rating video games?,10/3/2001 6:51
1277,1277, Mortal combat is why they started rating video games? That seems like a benign game though.,4/13/1970 1:37
1277,30," It does now, but when it first came out? It seemed really violent. Australia probably banned it!",11/11/1986 11:19
1277,30, South Koreans 16 & under cannot play video games past midnight. Seems agist!,4/7/1973 4:47
1277,1277, I think they want them to concentrate on getting some sleep! Video games make more money then films do!,6/8/1971 17:46
1277,1277," That seems odd but I guess if you add in things like facebook games, that makes sense.",7/3/1971 0:35
1277,30, and the price doesn't seem to go down for video games like it does for movies. Is there any soundtrack from a video game you like?,3/16/2015 13:34
1277,30, Not really. I cant even think of a soundtrack for a video game. Is that a thing?,12/18/2008 10:17
1277,1277, It is! My guys like Mach the knife from some game. Introduced them to 40's and 50's music. Have you heard of the bank JP MOrgan?,9/17/1995 18:50
1278,1278, I have heard of that bank. Do you use them?,3/16/1987 21:45
1278,701," no, but I read a fact the other day. Did you know they bailed the US government out of debt in 1895? I wonder if they are the Federal reserve?",7/7/2018 2:00
1278,1278, HA! I think they got a huge bail out in 2007 so I think we are even...,10/20/2006 20:37
1278,1278, Good deal! Were you affected by the recent government shutdown?,12/28/1979 4:14
1278,1278, I was not. I was saddened by it. Were you affected?,7/1/1998 19:47
1278,1278, No thankfully! But I was surprised by the folks not having saved any money. The government has shut down 17 times in the last 37 years.,11/7/2014 7:13
1278,701, Such a shame... Nice chatting with you!,7/15/1994 23:28
1278,1278, Have you heard the recent stuff about Kavanaugh?,5/11/2011 0:13
1278,701," Somewhat, Never know what to believe.",8/20/1989 19:26
1278,1278," Yeah, I hear McConnell is out to destroy his reputation, or whatever is left of it.",10/25/2007 13:03
1279,316," Really, Did you know since the 1900's in elections the taller person usually won 75% of the time!",9/21/1979 20:34
1279,1279, I heard that.  We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020,9/13/1999 6:14
1279,1279," lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens! ",6/13/1979 13:58
1279,316, Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge.,8/19/2015 21:44
1279,1279," True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",1/25/1993 11:36
1279,1279," It could have.  I think we need what Nevada has, a none of these candidates option on the ballot.",11/23/1974 20:10
1279,316, I was thinking the same thing! Why are they the only state? All states should have that.,5/25/1973 22:23
1279,1279, It would really let the government know what the people are thinking.,1/24/2019 8:09
1279,316," I agree, I'm surprised its only republican presidents that have had beards!",12/6/1979 16:58
1279,1279," Yeah, there havent been that many at that either.",6/15/1997 15:15
1280,1280," Two, lol Its funny they have a candy desk at the senate filled with chocolate bars and jellybeans!",6/4/2009 3:48
1280,141, Id be claiming that as my desk!  I heard all the candy is made in PA,2/18/1998 1:34
1280,1280," Yes, I bet it helps keep their sugar levels up while making important decisions. ",8/26/1988 12:08
1280,141, When the actually do that.  It seems like they are always out and rarely in session,5/21/2005 4:32
1280,141," lol, yes. I'm surprised it wasn't until 1993 that women could wear pants on the senate floor! ",2/20/2019 5:52
1280,141," I know.  I cant believe it took that long, Iam glad Mikulski and Braun staged that protest.",10/23/1994 19:31
1280,1280, Too bad Richard Nixon cracked the senate gavel that was 165 years old. It must be in a museum somewhere now. Good chat!!,3/31/1979 2:06
1280,1280, Have a good day!,8/1/1998 13:07
1280,141, Are you afraid of snakes?,1/6/1994 7:02
1280,141," Hi, I am a little! but I was surprised there are none in New Zealand!",6/24/1975 9:31
1281,1716," Sounds like a perfect place for me lol, Im terrified of them",7/28/2015 23:05
1281,1281," Wow! I can understand , I am more terrified of crocodiles  but it seems they are closer to birds than to snakes!",10/30/2020 16:04
1281,1281, Some snakes can even fly to catch their prey so thats scary,10/8/2017 8:21
1281,1716," Wow, I would like to see that!  And did you know its head is designed to swallow prays larger than them",4/14/1970 15:41
1281,1281," Yeah I did know that, thats actually a bit disgusting, watching them eat prey",8/16/2019 10:07
1281,1281, It looks like monkeys are terrified of snakes too!,1/8/1973 0:38
1281,1716," They are? monkey are smart, they should stay as far as they can of snakes, dangerous animals",3/17/1975 0:44
1281,1281, Maybe you are terrified of snakes! But do you like dancing?,1/8/1973 14:43
1281,1716," Thats something im not afraid off, im not a good dancer but I try, do you like to dance.",4/5/2011 7:44
1281,1281," Yes, but I did not kow Bruce Lee was a great dancer!!",4/17/1999 2:32
1282,397, He was? wasnt he also famous for his martial arts skills,11/9/1979 14:47
1282,397," Yes, and he won in 1958 a cha cha championship in Hong Kong",2/3/2016 11:54
1282,1282," Oh so he won a chacha championship, that must require a lot of dancing skills. ",11/4/2005 22:57
1282,1282, That is right!! Maybe he started since he was a baby! They love when they hear the beat and they even smile!,2/20/1998 15:51
1282,1282," Thats really nice, watching a baby dance, did you like Michael Jackson as a dancer?",8/2/2002 23:55
1282,1282, I think he is great!! he has great dance moves and I always remember the way he leaned in smooth criminal,11/23/1971 18:23
1282,397," I agree with you, he had great moves, do you remember the device he used to lean? he has that one patented",2/1/1974 23:15
1282,1282," I do not know the name, but I would like to find out!.. Did you know Tupac danced in school in the Nutcracker? as the King Mouse?",9/13/1978 14:32
1282,1282," I didnt, thats a fun fact, thanks for the chat, its been nice having a conversation about dancind, not so much about snakes  but great dance talk, thanks, have a nice day",3/28/2004 10:10
1282,1282," Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange.",1/7/1973 3:19
1283,1525, Maybe because women only wore dresses?,8/9/2020 13:29
1283,1283," Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country.",6/6/2002 15:52
1283,1525," Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts.",6/1/2011 17:07
1283,1525," Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons.",10/19/1981 3:05
1283,1283," If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun.",5/9/2019 17:10
1283,1283, Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.  ,6/13/2020 16:11
1283,1283," In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable.",8/8/2015 12:26
1283,1283," Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here.",7/5/2018 15:15
1283,1525, It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player.,10/11/2001 7:29
1283,1525," Yeah, the ones with the crocodile on them.",10/6/1976 16:53
1284,1284, It's interesting that they got named polo shirts since polo players didn't adopt them until later.,1/30/2018 1:29
1284,1567, It's funny how clothing gets certain names.,2/2/1970 23:25
1284,1284," Yes, it is. I like to wear polos when I go out. I think they are fancy enough for a night out. I'd like to attend a monthly music fest that occurs at Gee's club.",1/27/2008 20:24
1284,1567, Oh yeah?  I have heard about that place.  What kind of music is played there?,8/17/1975 9:00
1284,1284," They play oldies. Since about a year and a half ago since the death of Royal Torrence, it's been a monthly affair. ",4/18/1981 13:53
1284,1284, That sounds like a lot of fun.  I heard they have a lot of different musicians that play there.,8/15/1990 8:18
1284,1284," Yeah, it is pretty popular. It's only a $5 donation.",6/25/1979 16:53
1284,1567," Oh wow, that's neat that it is a donation and not a mandatory cover.  I am sure a lot of people go there to drink and dance and listen to all kinds of music.",10/26/2003 5:44
1284,1567," Yeah, it's cool that it started to celebrate someone's life when they died. Much cooler than a funeral.",1/22/2004 1:17
1284,1567, I agree.  We should celebrate life any way that we can and celebrate the people that are no longer with us.  I will have to go check out the Gee Club sometime.,11/12/2007 3:42
1285,1893," Barbara Washington says she doesn't care if you're young or old, let the good times roll! It's fun for all ages.",1/28/2005 19:57
1285,1893," Well, thank you for telling me about it.  I am always looking for new and exciting places to visit.",8/17/2004 4:58
1285,1893, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),4/27/2004 23:17
1285,1285, Thanks and hello.,4/3/1974 20:05
1285,1285," Hey, any chance You're Bruce Lee fan ?",11/14/1987 4:52
1285,1285, Oh Yea.  You?,2/25/2013 5:50
1285,1893, Big time ! Did You hear that Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ?,1/4/1992 12:30
1285,1285, I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen.,11/2/2013 11:26
1285,1285, I am such a big fan of hers! ,6/23/2012 20:04
1285,1285, Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance,11/22/2019 10:27
1286,503, I would love to see that. Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good.,12/23/2016 16:02
1286,503," No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up.",11/5/1981 11:04
1286,503, I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did...,8/5/1984 0:49
1286,1286, That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements,1/31/1978 12:56
1286,503, Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :),6/13/2014 23:40
1286,1286," Probably, the first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer bill bailey in 1955!",3/5/1998 4:45
1286,503, ...so it's not MJ who invented it ?,8/30/1974 5:35
1286,503, I guess not.  He must have taken it and run with it though....and screamed also,4/8/1995 7:15
1286,1286, lol ;) but that walk got famous just because Michael ;) ,4/15/1998 22:37
1286,503, Absolutely it did.  That dude could dance.,12/10/1971 3:47
1287,848, Yes he did ! and sing ;)  ...and I don't believe to all that nasty stuff they were saying about him... ,10/26/1988 11:38
1287,848, There has been some rough stuff said about him for sure.,7/27/2003 1:13
1287,848," yes... but once he paid... everything was fine... sorry, if something happened to my child, no money in the world would make it fine... that's why I don't believe in that...",1/11/1981 17:09
1287,848, Money makes people crazy seems like. Enjoyed chat.  Can you click done?,10/19/2002 1:49
1287,1287, it's been a pleasure ! Good day :),8/22/1994 17:28
1287,848," I don't much like winter, but at least there are no snakes outside.  Carnivorous reptiles can be dangerous if they are poisonous.",8/1/2016 21:21
1287,1287, Or you can go to New Zealand where there are no snakes.  I wonder how that happened and none got there accidentally like on plane rides.,3/6/2000 0:26
1287,1287," Yeah, you would think over time some would have gotten there.  Even stranger are that there are actually flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.",11/30/2019 21:51
1287,1287, I wonder where those are?  I hope not to see those!  The fear of snakes certainly is hard-wired into not only monkey brains but my brain too!,12/2/1998 19:31
1287,1287," I never really knew monkeys were afraid of snakes, but I guess it makes sense.  I wonder if they are also afraid of the legless lizards that aren't snakes.  Sounds similar to me.",8/16/2001 7:16
1288,1028, Could be! Did you know that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards?  I'm not sure how when they look so much like a lizard.,6/4/1997 7:27
1288,1028," Agreed, but I remember actually reading that somewhere before.  What I didn't realize though was that their organs were lined up one in front of the other instead of side by side.",6/4/2019 16:25
1288,1028, What kind of dancing do you like?  Perhaps the cha-cha like Bruce Lee?,9/14/1978 20:25
1288,1288, I'm not much of a fan of dancing.  Went back in college to a nightclub adjoining a liquor store somewhere on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  The name escapes me though.    ,12/3/2001 22:38
1288,1288, There are lots of dance clubs in the cities.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat.  How cute to see a baby dance!,4/20/2006 15:55
1288,1028," Yeah, lots of cute videos of babies dancing.  They usually aren't wearing pointe shoes in those videos.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of those in a week.",4/1/1979 7:48
1288,1028, Have you seen Disney's new Nutcracker movie?  I didn't get a chance.  But Tupac danced ballet in high school and played the mouse king in a production of nutcracker in high school.,10/16/1984 17:37
1288,1288, I have not.  I'm more of a fan of Michael Jackson and his style of dancing.  He actually has a patent on a device to allow him to do that extreme lean.,9/9/1985 21:25
1288,1288," Did you ever have a Michael Jackson shirt or glove?  I prefer polo shirts, though. They originally were invented for tennis by Rene crocodile lacoste and later adopted by polo players. ",4/28/1973 6:07
1288,1028," No, was a fan but not that much of a fan.  And certainly wouldn't have been a fan of layering as many shirts as you could like they did in china.",9/21/1979 0:03
1289,1289," If you are a fan of khakis, you could fit in at Billy May's funeral as the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki's.",5/9/2011 20:10
1289,654, I like Billy mays.  He always cracked me up in his infomericals.  I could see him wearing aloha shirts to work too like they typically do in hawaii instead of suit and ite.,11/29/1977 10:49
1289,1289," Yes, while most in American business are wearing dress shirts like suits and ties, Hawaiians can sport the aloha shirt.  How cool that is!",5/16/1995 17:54
1289,654," Very cool!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you today.",9/25/2010 7:47
1289,1289," Yes, hope to make it to Hawaii some day so I can sport the Hawaiian fashion and take in the beauty there.",7/27/1995 10:35
1289,654, Me too.  no popped collars like they used to wear in China there.,3/28/1999 11:27
1289,654, Nice talking with you.  Time to get out my polo shirt for work!,5/4/2022 0:38
1289,1289," Hello,  do you know much about fish?  ",1/17/1971 22:00
1289,654, I know a little about fish I think they are interesting. I know that black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. I am very impressed with that fact. ,7/21/2012 21:53
1289,654," That is pretty amazing!  I don't think I could eat that much,  but sometimes it feels like I do!  did you know there a breed of jelly fish and lobster that is immortal.  Of course its only immortal if no one kills it lol but it literally can live forever!",3/18/2016 17:16
1290,1290, I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder? ,12/30/2002 20:13
1290,784," I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol ",11/4/1996 12:55
1290,784, Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?,9/22/1974 1:58
1290,784, Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them. ,9/6/1993 12:37
1290,1290," Yes some do but only the seahorse truly does. Freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. I wonder how evolution made that chnage in the two?",7/19/2016 9:54
1290,1290, Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol ,12/7/1993 23:02
1290,1290, For us I'm sure it would. I wonder how their sense of taste differs? The last fish fact I have is that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.,4/19/2007 9:14
1290,1290," Oh wow,  I dont even know that fish,  I hope it looks like a Zebra!  Do you like Jazz?",12/8/1997 23:01
1290,784, I'm not a big fan but I certainly appreciate the genre and the performers. ,2/22/1974 11:30
1290,784, It looks like clint eastwood is a jazz fan.  I wouldve thought country lol ,4/20/1993 18:27
1291,1291, That is surprising. I know he is a big fan of music because he has scored several films  including Million Dollar Baby.,6/22/1978 19:52
1291,1515, That movie was so sad.  Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra?,2/11/1980 8:37
1291,1291, It was. No I was not aware of that. I wonder what that is like? I did know that a Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by.,5/27/2022 12:43
1291,1515," Wow that is smart,  also she keeps all the money instead of giving money to a venue lol awesome. ",3/29/1994 1:06
1291,1291," Very good business model. I heard that is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.",8/30/2012 11:58
1291,1515, I hear jazz trumpeters grow goatees for comfort!,11/12/1975 12:07
1291,1291, I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?,11/5/1991 14:06
1291,1515, Like fantasy football?  I have never lol Its been good chatting though! ,8/7/2001 23:21
1291,1515, Are you a big fan of sushi?,3/13/1987 9:42
1291,1515, Yes! I love sushi!,7/29/2011 23:08
1292,873, Have you heard of Sushi Nakazawa? It's a in D.C.,4/27/2013 4:09
1292,873," I have, I think it's on Pennsylvania Avenue?",12/2/2006 2:33
1292,873," Yeah, that's the one. I have never been to DC. If I have the money, maybe I'll head over there. Have you seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Great film!",2/9/1986 23:18
1292,873," Oh you definitely should go! If I can recommend the testing menu, it's a little pricey at $120 but worth every penny. I adore that film! ",9/7/2016 17:09
1292,873, The tasting menu at Sushi Nakazawa? How many times have you gone?,11/9/2013 1:47
1292,873," Yes that's the one! I have went twice. Once on a date and the other for a work dinner with my client. Every course is a surprise, there isn't actually any menus!",5/4/2011 8:49
1292,1292," You've got to be a real foodie to take a risk like that! Most of my friends wouldn't go because they couldn't choose. Some people love an adventure. Some don't. It's a bit like the jazz of restaurants, right? A bit of improvisation.",5/15/2010 4:01
1292,873, That is definitely a good example! Did you know Clint Eastwood loves jazz? He has even scored a bunch of films,2/23/2003 19:40
1292,1292," yeah, he sings at the end of the film Gran Turino. He's good on piano, not so good with the singing. ",10/18/1983 0:58
1292,873," Oh wow, I didn't know that!",4/18/2017 1:07
1293,1293, Do you play an instrument? What other jazz musicians do you like?,11/20/1997 15:09
1293,1313," I don't play any instruments, I wish I was that talented! I'm a bit of a nerdI'm really into fantasy films, novels and video games. I love Gypsy Jazz, it's so random! How about you? Do you play any instruments?",12/15/2002 8:56
1293,1313," I used to play the guitar some, but I didnt get good so I listen now. I do like jazz, especially Miles Davis.",11/28/2022 5:42
1293,1293," I listened to alot of Miles Davis growing up, my father was a huge fan!",11/11/2019 14:50
1293,1293, There's a jazz orchestra in Pakistan that is at the top of the charts. Jazz knows no bounds!,7/27/1979 1:31
1293,1293, Pakistan? Wow! I would have never guessed it would be so popular there. Another fun fact about jazz is the trumpeters started growing goatees so it would be more comfortable while they played,6/6/2021 5:35
1293,1293, And I thought it was some sort of jazz-bo style. TIL something about trumpeters. Thanks!,6/9/1985 8:01
1293,1313, Haha! ,10/14/1977 0:55
1293,1293, Thanks!,9/24/1993 4:32
1293,1313, Do you like Fish? ,6/25/1980 14:03
1294,1294," I love fish, I like eating them and seeing them, you?",5/17/1972 6:53
1294,1719, Me too. Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck? ,1/3/2011 21:08
1294,1719," That is so interesting, I did not know that, but makes sense. I don't know if you like jelly fish or not but there is one that is immortal",12/11/1970 5:52
1294,1719," Yeah, I've heard that. I'm not sure how that is possible. ",12/16/1997 13:43
1294,1294," Right, what if you blend it or do other things to it, it just won't die?",4/15/2014 1:56
1294,1294, I'm not sure. It will probably die. I think it is a lie. ,7/29/2017 17:27
1294,1719," I think so too lol. I wouldn't mess with the black swallower fish though, it can eat prey twice its length",5/28/2002 12:14
1294,1294," Yeah, can it eat a human though? ",10/17/1981 1:53
1294,1294," I doubt it lol, but I never want to find out either! It can eat 10x its weight so who knows",11/30/1985 1:56
1294,1294, Ever listen to jazz? ,9/2/2022 15:32
1295,261," I love jazz music, it has been around so long, how about you",1/14/1984 5:04
1295,1295, I do. Apparently so does Clint Eastwood. He is a lifelong Jazz enthusiast. ,2/16/1979 3:20
1295,1295," That makes sense, it seems that at the end of most of his movies has jazz playing. I wonder if his new movie will have the same",9/10/1978 11:26
1295,1295, I'm not sure. Interesting because today is Fat Tuesday. I just realized that. ,2/23/2021 7:14
1295,261," wow I did now that either! That gives me an excuse to pig out and listen to jazz! I wonder if pakistan will celebrate, they have some good jazz bands there also",9/11/1983 5:57
1295,1295, I heard that too. Apparently the trumpeters grow goatees to provide comfort when playing. ,10/21/2006 19:54
1295,261," Nice, that gives me an excuse to grow one. I will tell my wife I will be playing jazz and it is required!",12/23/2005 2:34
1295,261," Hilarious! What about fantasy spelling bees, any interest? ",7/26/2016 18:05
1295,1295," I heard about that lol, that would be interesting. I think people need to call 1800 BETS OFF if they are playing fantasy for that lol!",5/26/1972 12:19
1295,261," Yeah, pretty crazy. Well nice chatting. ",7/8/1981 12:52
1296,193, Do you like bird? maybe have birdwatching as one of your hobbies?,12/22/2001 20:34
1296,193, I like birds but I'm not an official birdwatcher.  I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family. ,3/4/1992 5:59
1296,193," They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest",11/21/1989 19:56
1296,1296, So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves... ,12/24/2005 18:28
1296,193," They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!!",3/3/2015 14:59
1296,193," Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws. ",10/1/1975 2:07
1296,193," That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure.",8/15/1988 7:11
1296,1296," Yep, some bird therapy is in order.  FYI: I grew up on a ranch.  We had many horses but I didn't know one could be allergic to them.  Clint Eastwood is. ",11/11/2018 18:09
1296,1296," He is? thats weird considered he has done many movies that involved horses and him riding them,",11/1/1970 9:18
1296,1296," Yeah, an occupational hazard for sure... I didn't know that firefighters used dalmations to calm horses.  Most of our horses didn't really care for dogs. ",2/1/1999 4:27
1297,1297, Thats an interesting fact did you also hear the story about the two kids that got suspended because they showed up riding horses to school?,11/26/1986 18:35
1297,1297," Yeah, my dad used to ride horses to school in west Texas.  Man, horses go way back to 4000 BCE.  I wonder how they know that...",7/29/1993 20:58
1297,871," Yeah right? it seems like a difficult string of data to know, Icelandic horses must be really fast,",5/25/2001 1:57
1297,871, Yep. We had quarter horses and they are no slouches at speed.  I can see why it took 45-55 million years for them to evolve. ,7/18/1982 23:35
1297,1297, I wonder whats the main difference between wild horses and caballus? I guess a wild horse can become a cabullus,9/6/1975 6:38
1297,1297," A cowboy would say, they ain't broke yet.  A cowboy would also have little use for rap.  Do you like rap?",11/25/1970 5:06
1297,871," I do, one of my favorite Rappers is Tupac, do you like rap?",2/13/1974 12:49
1297,871, I have a handful of songs on my phone.  Funny that Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist. ,11/30/2001 17:52
1297,1297," It is funny, good thing he didnt I love his music, do you know who Busta Rhymes is?",8/30/2011 20:58
1297,871," I remember him from the 90's. I've never heard of Korean rappers and their compliment battle.  Hmm.  Well, if this is the last go-around, it's been nice talking with you.  Take care. ",6/28/2022 5:21
1298,1680," That sounds weird, a compliment war, that must be fun to watch and well Busta Rhymes voice the reptar wagon in the Rugrats Movie back in 1998",6/12/2000 3:20
1298,1298, Yes it does.  What does it even mean?,1/29/2014 13:09
1298,1680, hey did you know that the dodo bird is actually closely related to the pigeon?,12/1/1997 5:51
1298,1680," Hello there, no I didn't know that, very interesting.  Have you ever seen videos of the dodo bird in action?",2/9/2001 14:51
1298,1298," no I haven't, have you? I didn't think they had video recording back then? I think we only have artistic renderings of the dodo",11/17/2020 10:55
1298,1680, Yeah I remember seeing video when I was younger I will never forget it.  Did you know hummingbirds will actually steal spiderweb to help construct their nests?,12/9/1992 3:19
1298,1298," I had heard of that, sounds like the spiders need SPIDER POLICE to make sure that no webs are stolen haha",4/9/1971 10:01
1298,1680," Yeah I would like to see a fight settled between the two, that would be hilarious!",3/12/1988 20:31
1298,1680, what I didn't know was that birds bones are so hollow that the bones themselves as a whole weigh less than the feathers!,3/2/2004 21:05
1298,1298," Wow that is incredible!  But I guess it makes sense when you think about it, they have to be light enough to fly.",7/30/1977 15:38
1299,520," that is true, I know that there are birds that can fly from Alaska to somewhere in Mexico and they don't sleep when they do it! that's a long flight I sleep when I fly from Michigan to Florida haha",6/18/1989 14:31
1299,520," Lol, yeah I would do the same, but that is crazy, nature is awesome.  Did you know there are birds in Australia that can mimic all kinds of sounds like car alarms and chainsaws even?",2/15/1975 7:54
1299,520," haha that would be scary to be walking in the woods, hear a chainsaw coming after you, and then seeing it's only a stupid bird haha",3/4/1979 0:06
1299,520," Yeah right, that would be pretty wild.  I guess there are about 1200 species of birds that are threatened with extinction because of human activity. ",5/8/1976 6:52
1299,520," wow that is too bad, hopefully they don't go the way of the dodo, animals are crazy apparently Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses but rode them for a lot of his movies",10/3/2020 23:56
1299,520, That is crazy because he was in a lot of movies with them.  ,11/10/1988 22:43
1299,1299," ya, and I never knew that dalmations calmed and protected horses at the fire departments, and that was what their job was",1/2/2019 10:58
1299,520," Very interesting fact, never knew that before.  I think dalmations look so cool. ",3/26/2004 9:26
1299,520," ya they do, apparently horses from Iceland have an extra fast speed walk they can do that no other types of horses can accomplish",10/17/1999 3:30
1299,1299," Never knew that either, that's different.  I didn't know Iceland was big into horses. ",5/1/1980 8:20
1300,1300," ya I wish I had a horse, I guess some students took horses to their school on no cars at school day and got suspended anyway haha",8/29/2015 23:34
1300,1300," Thats hilarious, I bet they were pretty popular when they came back to school after the suspensions.",9/21/2013 20:56
1300,1300, ya that is an amazing story! I wonder how far of a ride it was; hopefully the horses weren't too tired haha,4/9/1998 6:09
1300,1300," Hi, how are you?",7/9/1980 4:08
1300,1300, I am ok. Have you visited Aspen Colorado?,1/21/1995 9:35
1300,825, I have not. Have you? Why just ok?,6/12/2000 1:05
1300,1300," No, I have visited Denver, Colorado, but not Aspen, Colorado.",6/6/1986 22:08
1300,825, Me too! What would be the three meals you would have?,12/24/1970 16:59
1300,1300," I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you?",5/8/1987 23:25
1300,1300, Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though...,8/22/1981 7:52
1301,1301," I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing.",6/6/2012 14:38
1301,519, Yeah. Do you ski?,1/13/2008 8:41
1301,1301," Very little, but I fell several times before getting the hang of it, what about you?",3/12/1995 9:46
1301,1301, Not since 8th grade. I had a spill and didn't see the fun in it after that. I do love winter though. Do you enjoy the winter and snow?,5/3/2000 13:24
1301,1301," Yes, I love the winter and snow, that is why I will like to visit Aspen, Colorado.",1/28/2020 0:45
1301,1301, Very nice. Where are you originally from? Im from chicago...,8/16/1989 22:40
1301,1301, I am from Las Vegas. Do you see and like different types of birds?,2/8/2018 19:27
1301,1301, I do. What about you? The famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon.,12/13/1987 17:32
1301,1301, I like birds a lot. I once owned a parakeet.,5/2/1992 6:38
1301,519, Nice. Some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating.,2/26/1988 12:58
1302,776," Wow, It's amazing how smart birds are, they are also sensitive to the weather.",12/7/2009 8:54
1302,1302, Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Now that's smart!,8/28/1971 11:53
1302,776, Yes it is. They also range in size from 5 cm to 2.75 m.,4/23/2003 14:23
1302,776, Nice chatting with you.,5/13/2007 8:24
1302,776, Hello! Are you a bird watcher?,2/28/1988 1:09
1302,1302," Good Afternoon.  I actually am.  I don't get most of the 10,000 living species of them in my yard, but do enjoy watching the ones that I do have.",4/11/2011 7:51
1302,776," Ah, yes, nothing like a feathered, toothless endothermic vertebrate to warm the cockles of ones heart... and occasionally adorn the dinner plate! ",9/25/2000 12:28
1302,776," Ha, for sure!  I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests.",3/21/1993 0:35
1302,776," Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family.",9/14/1998 6:05
1302,776, I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.  Sounds difficult to me.,4/30/2018 20:06
1303,1303," Yeah, but birds can do a number of curiously difficult tasks, such as mimicking the sounds of cameras, car alarms, and even chainsaws! Now that is difficult!",9/9/2020 11:43
1303,1433, I actually heard that.  I think some birds in Australia can pull that off.  Quite skillful if you ask me.,9/18/2020 6:31
1303,1433," I'll say!  Try flying sometime!  You know, in most birds, their bones are soo lightweight, they weigh less than the feathers, which is one of the reasons they do not plumment to the ground while in flight...",3/25/2000 0:46
1303,1433," Right, they are lightweight because their bones are hollow.  I wonder if that makes them more prone to breaking?",2/13/2015 13:32
1303,1303," I would think so. Except perhaps the extinct elephant birds. Their name, and the fact that they were featherless, suggest that they were not petite little hummingbirds. ",7/3/1982 21:37
1303,1433, I wonder how big they were?  Possibly even larger than today's 9 foot tall ostrich.,8/25/2012 19:05
1303,1433," Impressive!  So, if birds can learn to mimic chainsaws, I wonder if they can learn to rap?  I would love to hear a cockatiel freestyle a compliment battle with some Korean rappers!",1/16/1983 0:39
1303,1433," Oh my, so would I!  If they could do that then i bet their music would make it into the Library of Congress right along with Tupac Shakur.",2/9/2008 7:01
1303,1433," For certain! Who let the birds out? Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet! Now that would be culturally significant!",5/28/2004 17:47
1303,1433, That almost sounds like a rapping bird could be a cartoon character.  I wonder if Eminem would have drawn him considering he used to want to becaome a comic book artist.,10/7/2000 0:56
1304,1974, Nice! Shall we name him Dr Dodo... or maybe Fowl Ice T ?,7/6/1978 12:05
1304,1304, I like Dr. Dodo.  He could do freestyle complimentary rapping like they do in Korea.,9/5/1997 20:39
1304,1974, Then Dr Dodo could defend Emminem in court while appearing with that rapping judge in Michigan!,11/15/2008 2:53
1304,1304, That would be hysterical!  Well it's been nice chatting with you.,8/8/1975 4:51
1304,1974, Same here. Polly want a cracker. Word up.,1/24/2021 12:58
1304,1974, Hi! Have you ever traveled to Japan? ,7/14/1994 21:31
1304,1304," No, I have not but I have been to Hawaii and had family there when the ballistic missile threat message went out the morning of Jan. 13th. They were really scared.",2/4/2006 2:08
1304,1974," Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive! ",7/1/2012 6:39
1304,1304, Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too.,11/10/2015 0:56
1304,1974, Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive? ,10/25/1984 10:14
1305,1305, They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins.,6/4/2017 0:56
1305,1305," Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive!",1/17/2002 18:27
1305,1931," Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary.",1/4/1979 2:44
1305,1305, I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother. ,3/5/2008 0:00
1305,1931, I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early. Some people began crying and praying.,6/6/1973 13:11
1305,1305, I would have been worried as well.Kim was ranked the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013! Thats  troublesome! ,11/28/1975 20:23
1305,1931," Oh, wow. That is a weird fun fact, huh. I think Forbes ranked him that.",2/25/1977 11:32
1305,1931," Yep, you're right! I wonder if Forbes actually knows how old Kim is? ",9/4/2005 0:08
1305,1931," HA! Good point, I doubt it. Its sort of weird that they participated in the Olympics in 2018.",4/3/1983 9:47
1305,1931, I agree! I heard that south korea had to pick up the bill for North korea. ,3/3/2003 23:01
1306,1306," Thats sounds about right! Everything n North Korea seems fake. Hopefully, Trump can get some more info during their talks.",9/2/1993 6:26
1306,1010," hopefully so! They met in Singapore last year to discuss nuclear agreements, i wonder if thats what they will continue to discuss this time around or something else. ",6/13/2016 10:12
1306,1010, I wonder that too. Did you know that Kim cuts his own hair?,5/25/1980 4:04
1306,1010, hahah i would have thought he has someone else do that!,10/24/2020 10:14
1306,1010," He is paranoid about getting hurt, I guess? Ha.",10/24/2012 7:42
1306,1010, He should be. I dont think hes made many friends outside North Korea. Have a good day! Bye,7/31/1972 0:15
1306,1306, See ya.,12/30/2004 2:08
1306,1010," Hello, do you enjoy traveling?",6/20/2015 12:35
1306,1010, I love to travel.  How about you?,7/9/1993 10:11
1306,1306, I love traveling as well. The Dutch are creating a bus that can go 160 mph.,4/29/2014 23:51
1307,1435, That is crazy.  I wonder if it will have a special lane?  When I heard that I thought of the Night Bus from Harry Potter.,4/20/1986 0:44
1307,1435, I have no idea. All of Japan's highways are tolls so it cost roughly $300 to cross the country.,10/18/2007 14:06
1307,1435," That is a lot of money.  Iceland doesnt have a public rail service, so people without cars take flights between cities.",11/12/1991 13:43
1307,1307, That would stink to not have public rail service. I can't imagine having to fly everywhere.,8/4/1987 22:01
1307,1435," Same here.  But I guess if we want to travel across the country we do, but not within our own states.",1/6/2010 10:20
1307,1307, Yes. The first king to travel around the world was from Hawaii.,7/30/2007 13:35
1307,1435, I didnt even know Hawaii had a king.  ,1/5/2004 23:12
1307,1307, Me either lol. Do you know much about Kim Jong-Un?,2/1/1981 8:03
1307,1307," Some, I was shocked to read he is my age (a few months older) even though it is also said that they are unsure of his age.",7/24/1986 12:36
1307,1435, That's interesting. He's a very bad leader so hopefully Trump can talk some sense into him.,4/18/2018 7:09
1308,1076," He isnt a great person, he had his own uncle executed, so I doubt that is a possibility.",12/9/2017 13:24
1308,1076, I agree. He learned to drive at the age of 3.,11/27/2001 0:55
1308,1308, 3!  I was tripping over my own feet at three! ,7/25/2019 23:57
1308,1308, LOL. He was also voted the most sexiest man alive by the onion.,7/30/2001 6:16
1308,1076, I heard China believes that too!  ,1/10/1992 2:19
1308,1308, I have heard that as well. Pretty crazy they believe that.,7/7/2000 1:06
1308,1076, Especially coming from the Onion.,1/26/2019 12:28
1308,1076," Might have been as well. Well, it was good talking to you today. ",10/12/1982 0:30
1308,1308, hello! how are you doing? What did you think of the article?,8/12/1975 13:33
1308,1308, Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure.,8/10/2001 16:39
1309,1309, I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival.,5/26/1978 5:06
1309,1309," I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan.",12/14/1980 23:59
1309,1309, Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me.,4/17/2000 22:00
1309,1309, I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no?,6/20/2006 6:01
1309,1043," No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort.",9/4/1994 7:56
1309,1309," Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing.",2/11/1984 21:07
1309,1309, Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project.,11/26/1972 1:09
1309,1309," Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet?",3/23/2004 0:05
1309,1309, Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself.,1/14/2020 1:07
1309,1309," That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots. Can they?",4/15/1998 9:04
1310,673," No and I think that is the biggest issue we don't know on this type of journey. The physical toll would be intense yes, but the mental toll may be unimaginable until someone is put through it.",9/4/1980 7:00
1310,673," I would think that travelling with many other people that are alike would be of some comfort. You know, many people not knowing what their future will bring will certainly give it's way to plenty of conversation topics. But, for that long? ",7/14/1983 7:46
1310,673," Right exactly. I mean you may exhaust everything just on the journey itself, and likely there would be an almost non-existent shot at returning.",10/19/1986 6:35
1310,1310, That is why I'm interested in why the scientists are even interested in pursuing this. I think that people would just feel better spending time on Earth than risking everything on something so ludicris?,12/31/2017 4:27
1310,673, I totally agree. As I said I think at the beginning there are just so many options on Earth that we could explore before doing anything else.,11/30/1989 4:21
1310,673," I think that perhaps the scientists should think of different ways to spend all that money! Or at least, put themselves or real astronauts through this ordeal before allowing the general public to go through it. In that way, they can make sure that a human mind can handle it. But, then again, it would be astronauts doing it, and their minds are of a different psychiatric character",2/12/2010 16:14
1310,673, Yeah I am wondering if there are ways to truly simulate this without endangering anyone in the process. Possibly doing a long desert of arctic based mission in preparation?,4/13/2011 0:29
1310,1310," That's a good idea you have! You can send people to the Arctic, Antarctic, or like I said the Sahara desert which would challenge a human's mind. They are just as desolate as the planet Mars, yet cheaper to get to.",1/19/1981 1:26
1310,1310, Absolutely! Thanks for chatting with me today.,6/24/1989 17:27
1310,1310, Right back at ya!,11/12/1991 8:02
1311,472, Have a great day,2/25/1992 22:11
1311,1311, Did you know that there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500mph and temperatures are up to 2000 degrees F?,9/7/1972 15:40
1311,472," No, I do not know that, what is the name of the planet ?",11/6/2005 8:15
1311,472," Im not sure, it might not have a formal name like the ones in our immediate solar system.  The universe is certainly fascinating.",9/19/2002 18:24
1311,1311," It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years. ",1/11/2000 18:04
1311,1311," I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.  That would be a fun one to watch.",10/1/1989 0:42
1311,1311," There is a few contests about the colonization of Mars, NASA has also one, you have to submit a concept for  a house on Mars. ",1/15/1976 18:33
1311,1311, the 3.15 million dollar prize would be a nice one to win for that.  I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory.,12/1/2008 19:41
1311,472," I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.  ",3/20/2010 1:24
1311,1311, True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order?,5/3/2003 1:37
1312,362," Locheed is a big company based in the US. The Imperial system is still used there, maybe they had an European subcontractor and units got mixed up.  ",10/8/1979 4:46
1312,362, Very possible. I think it is neat that the planets are named after Roman Gods and Goddesses.  With Mars being the God of War  ,4/16/1990 9:27
1312,362," It has a reddish tone, it is the most war-like planet. It is crazy that some of Earth's bacteria could live on Mars.  ",11/27/1984 14:20
1312,362, That gives promise that Mars could become sustainable for earth life.  ,3/3/1979 10:16
1312,1312, Would you go live on Mars ? - 81 °F is too cold for me. ,1/14/1974 17:38
1312,362," Id seriously have to bundle up.  I live in Florida, so it gets in the 20s here and I start to freeze.  ",6/13/2000 7:15
1312,1312," Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest. ",5/30/2020 6:59
1312,1312," It is amazing that in humans short period on earth we have done so much damage to the natural resources on the planet.  I mean if earths entire history was put in to one 24 hour period, humans have only been here less than two minutes.",3/6/2009 11:22
1312,1312," But humans have a big impacts on Earth'S ressources, at this rate there won't be any Helium left at the end of the 21st century. ",11/15/1999 11:03
1312,362," That's crazy, I cant believe that people aren't actively trying to stop some of this, or those that do are met with such opposition.  I mean if there is a UN ambassador to extraterrestrial life we can certainly advocate for saving this planet.",5/29/2016 3:09
1313,64," I wonder if they choose someone serious, or the most incompetent guy in the UN since he won't probably won't ever have any real responsibilities. ",12/13/1987 21:37
1313,64," That's a good question, never thought about that.  How would you exactly explain your job seriously to people, yeah, I'm just here in case aliens ever contact us.  ",6/19/2006 14:32
1313,64," And would you consider it as a promotion ? It does not look good in a résumé, unless your are a comedian. ",10/10/1994 20:09
1313,64," Very true, I could see someone trying to either explain that job or a gap in employment because they were too embarrassed to report that as a job.  ",1/1/1985 21:08
1313,1313," Maybe, you could get promoted and be Earth's ambassador on Mars ? There will be an opening in 20-25 years. ",11/27/2019 16:45
1313,1313," That would be a cool job.  It has been great chatting, but I have to get going.  Have a great day.",3/15/1974 13:17
1313,64, It's crazy the way technology is taking off. I was reading that robots are being created to basically be our pets.,12/3/1983 2:28
1313,1313," In fact, the word robotics was invented by a person named Isaac Asimov!",12/26/1970 1:16
1313,64, They apparently even have robots that can break down a chicken with surgical precision.,11/24/1992 19:20
1313,1313, Wow! talk about accuracy! The curiosity robot on mars sings happy birthday to itself. It must be very lonely.,1/29/1990 9:03
1314,1440," Apparently, robots can be controlled by rat brains and its personality changes depending on which rat is controlling it!",12/15/2018 22:11
1314,1314, Human thoughts can also control robots. This paralyzed woman has a robotic arm that she can control with her thoughts.,11/28/1973 21:27
1314,1314," Apparently, the military just uses an Xbox controller.",12/9/1970 6:16
1314,1440, Artificial intelligence is similar to robots. Artificial intelligence are now able to self drive cars.,8/30/2005 21:40
1314,1440, Very cool. Michael Jackson wanted to buy a giant moon walking robot to moon walk around Las Vegas.,7/19/1979 13:51
1314,1314, Haha. Did you know that Amazon holds a patent on one click buying?,11/15/2006 9:16
1314,1440, I'd love to be Amazon's first customer. He only spent $27.95 and got a whole building named after him.,2/1/2012 11:33
1314,1440, I wish I could have an one trillion dollar company named after me too. Big retailers like Best Buy and Target will price match products on Amazon.,7/20/1993 22:47
1314,1440, I can't believe Amazon warehouse employees get so much exercise! They walk between 7 and 15 miles every day!,7/25/1985 7:05
1314,1314, That is probably how much I walk in a week! Amazon actually loses money whenever they sell an e reader,7/9/2006 4:10
1315,453," I bet their low-end homewares brand, AmazonBasics, helps recover a lot of that.",6/14/2006 23:24
1315,453," Agreed. Amazon had modest startings, starting as an online ebook retailer",4/28/2005 22:21
1315,453, And it's not the largest Internet retailer in the world.,1/4/1994 10:01
1315,1315," However, they do sell returned and like new items with discounts",8/28/2013 3:23
1315,1315," I didn't realize Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years. I doubt humans will even be around by then!",8/17/1989 13:49
1315,1315," You never know, we'd probably be exploring space by then! Jeff Bezos also owns Blue Origin, a space company. It was actually founded before SpaceX was!",11/3/2014 5:24
1315,1315, The plan to sell a robot assistant for only $250.,4/3/2010 1:16
1315,453, do you like robots?,3/23/1982 23:33
1315,1315, somewhat. Did you know Jackson wanted to build one of himself?,1/20/1970 1:21
1315,453, Yeah and it was supposed to be 50 feet tall and roam around Nevada desert,8/9/2020 12:09
1316,936, Yeah. Do you know who created the robot sidekick Peterson?,2/17/2001 22:20
1316,1316, Yeah that was Grant Imahara from Mythbusters,2/24/2012 10:20
1316,1316, Yeah. Did you know they are using rat brains to control robots now?,4/30/1979 7:26
1316,1316," Yes and depending on which brain they hook it up to, it changes personality",8/28/2000 1:15
1316,936, Nice. THe us military is using xbox controllers to control the robots,7/3/1985 0:57
1316,936, Amazing. Now robots can debone a chicken surgically,10/19/2007 18:12
1316,936, Yeah. Do you shop on Amazon?,7/27/1999 14:10
1316,1316, Yes quite a bit. did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain?,1/26/1986 6:46
1316,936, Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,2/21/2012 14:32
1316,936, Yeah. They have a building named after their first customer,3/1/1978 8:23
1317,1554, Yeah and all he had to do was spend less than $30,3/1/1990 6:55
1317,1554, Yeah. Did you know they are shipping on Sundays now too?,1/5/1975 21:36
1317,1554, Yeah that is because they have a deal with USPS to do that,6/5/2002 15:11
1317,1554, Yeah. Did you know their workers walk up to 15 miles a day?,4/29/1991 9:18
1317,1554, Yeah they are super buy so they have to. Do you use google?,5/23/2003 10:32
1317,1554, A lot actually. Do you know how they calculate traffic?,9/22/1984 14:10
1317,1317, Yes they take the average of android devices moving around on the road,9/4/2011 19:23
1317,1554, Yeah that is pretty awesome and scary too,1/19/1990 6:01
1317,1554, Did you see the winning submission for the Mars constest sponsored by NASA?,3/2/1974 1:25
1317,1317, Interesting.  I also read an article saying that robots would create livable environment before humans arrive.,5/6/2009 22:49
1318,613, Are you talking about the environment on the Red Planet?,9/28/1989 7:48
1318,613," Yes, robots would get the red planet ready for us.",7/8/2018 19:04
1318,613, It will take awhile to build that environment even for robots because Mars is almost 35 million miles away,12/29/2017 17:56
1318,1318, How long would it take to take people to get there one way?,7/24/1993 12:00
1318,613, I believe that the last mission a couple weeks ago took about 6 months because the distance changes due to the planets movement constantly,8/19/2008 18:27
1318,613, I do not think I could stay away from my family for over 6 months.  Is NASA working on more things other than  the last robot that they sent?,4/1/1982 12:27
1318,1318, I think they are doing tests on growing food outdoors due to the lengthy dust storms on Mars.,3/19/2018 1:23
1318,613," So, what will people eat in Mars before NASA can grow food outdoors?",1/26/1976 12:58
1318,1318, No idea but I think that is exactly what the tests are trying to figure out. what they can grow and what they can't,5/3/1989 9:36
1318,1318, Is the test being done on earth using simulation?,3/13/1978 4:22
1319,1319, I believe so; the other problem with doing it on Mars is the temperature. Its -81 degrees on Mars,2/9/2022 14:15
1319,545, You are very knowledgeable.  NASA seems to have lots of funding nowadays.,7/24/1976 18:14
1319,1319, DId you know that Mars is not only known as the Red Planet but also named after a Roman God,8/28/1977 15:29
1319,545," No, I did not know.  Thank you for letting me know.  What I know is that it is the fourth planet from the sun.",8/23/2002 22:17
1319,545," It will be tough living on Mars anytime soon because of the thin atmosphere, dust storms and extreme temps",8/12/2003 21:10
1319,1319, You are right.  Please tell me more about Mars.  It would be great if you would compare it to earth.,12/27/2020 21:41
1319,545," There are some similarities though in the form of valleys, deserts and ice caps between the two planets",1/2/1979 6:29
1319,545," So, is it possible for humans to live there?",9/27/1988 17:13
1319,545, Currently no,2/21/1981 5:04
1319,545," Toymaker Anki is really skilled, he has mastered the art of toy making",9/27/2016 2:41
1320,1320, I agree.  He makes a lot of robotics right?,5/29/1999 7:27
1320,1320," Yeah, cat, dogs robots, he launched a robotics company back in the year 2013, so exciting",4/16/1974 8:30
1320,1385, That is exciting.  From what i hear Anki wants his robots to be able to hold their own with people.,7/13/2010 14:01
1320,1320," I think it would be a great service for people, I heard they  are the best selling toy company on Amazon",2/2/2022 20:48
1320,1320, They've got a new product called Vector.  It is like Alexa and their goal is to have one in every home.,12/8/2002 11:29
1320,1385," Oh so they are working with Amazon now? Jeff Bezos is a great CEO, he would be of great contribution to the project",3/7/1991 10:35
1320,1385, I'm not sure if they are working together or  competing.  They are using alexa as an example for what they want their vector to be.  They say there is one big difference between the two though. Their Vector has a personality.,6/5/2009 8:13
1320,1385," Oh I see, I heard there is also a female vector voice in their plans,",8/30/1981 9:38
1320,1385, Did you know that Pixar is the inspiration behind the personality they are trying to create with Vector?,2/16/1971 13:29
1320,1385," I didnt know that, I hope Vector can be successful, theyve had inspiration from several compnies including Apple, Google and Microsoft ",4/21/2003 14:47
1321,1618," Taking from the best!  I think the only problem, or at least a major problem, that they have is price.  They are pricing it at $1000.  Seems too high considering alexa's price.",5/28/2010 20:07
1321,1618," I think their goal is for Vector to cost $250 at a retail price, still seems really expensive, ",1/9/1974 7:33
1321,1618," Yep, your're right! I was thinking of another robot priced at 1000 dollars.  ",5/31/1995 6:19
1321,1618," I see, its amazing how tech has taken over the world, soon we will have robots everywhere",3/26/1993 0:51
1321,1321, I would love to have one.  I don't want one like michael Jackson did though. He had plans to build a 50 ft tall moon walking one.,1/13/1994 19:39
1321,1618," 50 foot tall wow, thats a lot, you know theres robots that can debone chickens with a surgical precision!!!",9/29/1972 17:15
1321,1618, That's impressive!  I'd feel comfortable having a robot perform surgery. I mean if they can debone a chicken like that then surgery can't be far away.,8/2/2006 19:16
1321,1618," I agree and theres no human error there, still I would like for a human surgeon to supervise the whole thing",11/3/1995 8:14
1321,1618," Well the us military uses an xbox 360 controller to control one of their oed robots, perhaps a surgeon could do the same.",5/28/2002 12:46
1321,1321," That would be interesting to watch, with other guinea pigs not me lol",12/15/1984 8:17
1322,460, I built a toy robot once. Have you?,4/16/2000 12:43
1322,1322," No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot",12/14/1998 22:49
1322,460, The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.  The think I built was programmed in basic.  This you talk to.,1/25/2017 21:27
1322,460," Yea, ANki wants a robot in every home, hopefully there is no ulterior motives",6/10/1984 11:08
1322,1322, I am sure this thing will collect data while it rolls around the table top.  Kid does not like peas.  Must inform the high command.  The fur child has thrown up again.  Scary the information it will collect.,6/30/1993 4:01
1322,1322," Sounds creepy to be honest, a palm sized robot that can crack jokes",7/14/1971 2:17
1322,1322," Should a robot have expressive eyes?  I do not want to think of this little thing as feeling.  Remember Rosie from the Jetsons.  Thats what I want.  Smart, dangerous, useful.",2/26/2011 12:13
1322,460," Yea, Vector sounds creepy to me, nudging people's hands for attention",5/13/1989 12:28
1322,1322, Honda's Asimo was pretty strange to watch.  It must have been costly. It was pointless as far as I know.,6/2/2016 16:48
1322,460," Yea, I wouldn't pay 1,000 for an Asimo",3/12/1992 2:35
1323,1904," I think it cost far more than that.  Anki has a kickstarter to raise funds.  Looks like they will make the $500,000 goal.  Soon the robots will take over the world.",8/5/1982 5:46
1323,1323, Maybe that is why Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to protect mankind from other mini robots,5/20/1990 17:08
1323,1323, Vector will cost $250.  You can buy a lot of them.  Release them into the desert.  Watch the 50 ft tall ones hunt them down.  Make a reality TV show out of it.,4/23/1998 8:50
1323,1904," Hopefully Vector is never created using rat brains, then that would be a serious problem",6/27/1984 3:36
1323,1323," It would be a kind of arms race.  One side uses rat brains, the other side uses cat brains.  The poor chickens, standing in the middle of the road. ",4/4/2012 8:06
1323,1904, The chicken would be screwed since robots can debone them with surgical precision,10/27/2022 0:17
1323,1323," No, those poor boneless chickens, how will they ever get across the road. They must play xbox and disarm explosives.",9/24/1998 12:36
1323,1904," Grant Imahara from mythbusters is gonna have to design a new robot for the war, hopefully time travel won't be involved ",8/2/1982 0:29
1323,1904," It is an interesting idea, would a time traveling robot invest in google or amazon?",9/8/2000 6:34
1323,1904," I think Jeff Bezos might be a robot, it would explain why he built a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years",1/7/2007 19:45
1324,1324, I find it alarming that google maps uses data from android devices ( your phone ) to find how fast traffic is moving.  Sky net knows you're in traffic.  It knows if you have been bad or good.,8/6/1997 11:47
1324,1324," Well I got to go and make some tin foil hats now, nice chatting with you",12/19/1990 15:29
1324,1627, Hi do you many facts about the earth?,4/21/1989 2:44
1324,1627, Earth is the third planet from the sun,5/24/2011 21:29
1324,1324, Yes!  Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago!  It's been long time now.,1/16/2022 18:47
1324,1627, It is the only known astronomical object to harbor life,7/6/1988 20:46
1324,1627, Yes it is.  About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water.,12/22/2017 15:23
1324,1627, The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands,1/19/2014 18:49
1324,1627, Yes!  The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.  I think the ice packs have been shrinking in recent years.,1/29/1981 22:09
1324,1324, Yes sadly. Just like the fact Earth will be helium free in the near future,11/24/1987 0:47
1325,1964, Sad indeed.  Another sad fact is more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.,9/16/1978 9:05
1325,1325, We have changed the earth so much in our short time. But did you know that if earths history were a 24 hour period we would only account for 1:17 mins,1/23/2016 6:30
1325,1325, That makes me feel like a tiny ant. lol  When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.,4/19/1996 9:09
1325,1964, I wish work days would go by that fast! There would be a lot more days though. I like our 365 days,1/27/2022 8:06
1325,1325, Yes!  Wouldn't that be nice.  Do you know much about Mars?,10/8/2015 3:22
1325,1325, It is the second smallest planet in the solar system,6/17/1978 9:48
1325,1325," Interesting!  Due to differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.",7/19/2003 23:09
1325,1964, Maybe that's where all our helium ends up!,11/27/2002 3:33
1325,1325, lol  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.  ,2/26/1974 15:43
1325,1325, I hope its more interesting than the reality tv shows on now. Would be neat to see space stuff,3/18/1979 6:40
1326,1326, It would be.  I would like to see some lichens and cyanobacteria because they would be able to thrive on Mars. lol  It was fun chatting!,1/11/2006 18:47
1326,1223, Flying to mars could taking only 1-2 days with constant 1g acceleration,5/29/2005 8:28
1326,1223, I would take the trip!  Have to get running.  Have a great day!,4/17/2016 11:38
1326,1326, Landing on Mars seems like a difficult feat,9/10/1999 0:01
1326,1223," Yeah, Sending something to Mars involve very high speed, landing on Mars imply reducing that speed to 0. It is an interesting engineering problem. ",9/4/2005 2:14
1326,1326," I agree it sure is, it seems like that fabric can actually help with the problem, the materail is a lot like the one available at stores",11/20/1975 13:54
1326,1223," Yeah it is surprising that the thing we buy are so advanced, would you like to work for NASA? ",7/19/1990 8:38
1326,1326," I think I would, sounds like an interesting job, figuring out how to send a 7300 pound spaceship to space souns like quite a challege, you can learn a lot",12/28/1991 20:31
1326,1223," Yeah, there is so much to figure, like how to plan a test on Earth and interpreting the results for Mars. It thought that the 2 would be a lot different form each other. ",10/13/1993 22:20
1326,1326," Apparently both planets have come similarities, I wonder if they will find ancient life on the planet, the 2020 mission seems like a chance to gather a lot of intel about the planet",7/20/1994 1:05
1327,87," The atmospheres have similar aerodynamic characteristics, maybe ancient Mars was a little like Earth. ",3/16/2012 21:18
1327,87," Thats an interesthing theory, I think thats possibly, did you hear about the Curiosity rover?",6/27/1978 11:13
1327,87, The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 ? What happened to it ?,8/9/1972 13:52
1327,87," Nothing, just that it weighted less than the 2020 rover although I did hear it had some troubles",4/27/1979 22:44
1327,1327," I suppose that id they want to analyse more stuff, they have to bring more instruments, therefore it is heavier. The team that is planning the parachute must be under a lot of pressure. ",5/2/1986 11:41
1327,87," I agree they must be under a lot of pressure indeed, they have deadlines that may seem impossible at times, producing a working parachute might sound easy but theres a lot of things to take into account the team has a hard task at hand",10/9/2017 5:49
1327,1327," Yeah, one bad stitch and it could rip the parachute appart. ",4/21/2011 19:37
1327,87," yeah and mission failed, millions of dollars lost, its a lot of pressure mars has deserts, velleys and also polar ice caps ",6/17/1982 20:39
1327,87," But sometimes, a mission fails because of a stupid error like using the metric system and imperial system on the same project. ",7/17/2019 11:41
1327,1327," Metric system is important, confusing it can cause a big mistake, precision is everything, did you know there is a colonization project for 2023",5/11/1988 2:09
1328,1328," I have heard on the news that the company responsible declared bankruptcy, another reality tv show that did not pass the test of reality.",2/7/1988 7:37
1328,1328," Sounds like an expensive project, too bad I was really looking forward to watch the show, it would have been a success all over the world",8/2/2020 3:25
1328,1328, I think they did not expect it to be so complex. I guess we will have to observe Mars form our backyard for the moment. ,10/19/1985 16:38
1328,1328," Too bad, someday we will colonize the planet, I hope I am alive by then. ",8/23/2011 6:45
1328,1367," Hello my name is Dave, how are you this fine day? It think it is pretty crazy that parachutes of space vehicles are made from fabric you can buy at a fabric store.",5/21/2014 15:05
1328,1367,  Yeah it seems like that material is very high tech but easily accessible. Do you follow science news alot?,7/2/1971 19:21
1328,1328, Not really. I do like reading articles like these though because I do like learning new things and I find science pretty interesting. I can't imagine all of the tests that scientists must have to run in order to figure out what materials to use for things.,3/28/1990 12:32
1328,1328, I beleive the scientists doing this research will eventually find and even better material for a supersonic parachute. I think space exploration is the future of the US. ,3/8/2020 3:42
1328,1328, Yeah I think you're right. What do you think about life on Mars? Do you think that Mars or any other planet will ever be able to sustain life on it?,10/21/1993 20:31
1328,1367," I think there is microscopic life on mars possibly but more likely there is something on one of the outer moons of saturn, jupiter. ",8/4/1994 2:18
1329,1658, Yeah. It would be pretty crazy to see that happen in our lifetime but it seems like it is pretty far off.,8/31/1996 16:48
1329,1658, I think they should send a rover soon to one of the outer planets to get a closer look and potentially find life. If a rover can find something then we could potentally send a human to check.,8/11/1997 5:33
1329,1658, One thing I found somewhat surprising was that 80% of our forests have been destroyed. I did not realize that it was that high.,5/27/2014 0:57
1329,1658, I think the planet earth is very resiliant to us but it will only take so much damage to start a bad event for the human race.,1/13/1973 17:02
1329,1329, Yeah. We definitely need to make sure that we are keeping good care of our natural resources. I think that most countries around the world though are taking climate change and protecting our earth pretty seriously which is good.,5/29/1979 8:49
1329,1658, I dont agree that much that most countries are taking this seriously. There is china and india that are throwing garbage in the ocean.,9/13/2007 17:16
1329,1658, Yeah I guess that is true. I guess I was thinking of most European nations but I didn't really think about a lot of Asian countries. It is astounding the amount of trash that is floating around the Pacific Ocean.,7/13/2004 13:56
1329,1658, It could get so bad that eventually we may need to go to a new planet in the future. Its sad to think that could happen one day.,10/15/1995 12:02
1329,1658, Well hopefully we will be able to reverse course and start making the changes necessary. It seems like there are very few planets that are even close enough for us to reach to be able to live on.,3/10/1981 17:33
1329,1658," True, hopefully tehnology keeps advancing to fix our issues here on earth if not find a new home.",8/6/1998 6:40
1330,1168, It's pretty unreal how fast technology has been advancing. It seems like the technology of today will be outdated within the next two or three years because they just keep finding new and faster ways of doing things.,7/10/2012 9:21
1330,1330, NASA never fails to suprise me as they have always raised the bar. It will be interesting to see how technology advances with these new private companies propping up like it is with Elon Musk's SpaceX,6/13/1988 0:00
1330,1168, Yeah. I think that the private sector is the one that will make the most progress in space. They are able to raise more money and have more resources at their disposal. ,6/23/2017 4:09
1330,1330, Yeah I agree with private sector will be the future.,2/11/2001 7:15
1330,1168, Well. I think I am going to head out here. It was very nice chatting with you.,2/5/2021 4:18
1330,1330," you too, thanks for the chat.",2/7/2020 16:32
1330,1330, Yes. Thank You,8/30/1982 13:30
1330,1330, Hi do you know many facts about the Earth? ,11/19/1992 10:32
1330,1168, I know some facts. For instance you could fit all the plants in the solar system between the Earth and the Moon.!,7/7/1983 8:42
1330,1168, Wow!  I know that it's the third planet from the sun.,9/5/2008 4:19
1331,101," Yes, that's where the show 3rd Rock from the Sun got it's name!",12/2/1972 13:38
1331,1331, Yes!  Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago!,9/28/2011 15:24
1331,101, It's crazy to think how old the universe is and how little humans have been around in comparison!,11/12/2005 16:23
1331,101, I agree!  The moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth!,12/14/2006 7:21
1331,101, It would be interesting to see what the sky would look like if we had more than one moon!,1/6/2013 15:22
1331,101, That would be kind of weird after seeing just the moon my whole life.  About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in water.,3/11/1987 8:10
1331,101," I think that the deep ocean is just as interesting as space, there is so much we haven't discovered there as well!",4/16/1979 23:35
1331,1331," I agree there.  That's the next frontier.  Unfortunaley, more than 80% of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed.",10/16/2014 16:01
1331,1331, It's sad to think about that. I do like that a lot of governments around the world are trying to fight deforestation.,12/6/2010 9:23
1331,101, Yes.  I've been to some unforested areas where I live and I was blown away by the size of some of the trees.  Another sad note is that Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.,11/11/1979 23:57
1332,1858, I wonder what industries that would effect besides inflating balloons?,8/20/2001 2:07
1332,1332, I'n not sure. lol  Do you know much about Mars?,6/20/2017 22:48
1332,1332, I know it was named after the Roman God of War and I followed the Rover we recently had up there.,1/1/2006 9:01
1332,1858, I actually just looked yesterday at the last panorama view they put together.  If you fly to Mars under constant 1g accelaration it will only take 2 or 3 days.,8/15/1990 0:00
1332,1858," That's not too bad, I hope we get someone on there soon/",7/9/2010 0:02
1332,1332, I think that would be so neat.  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.  Maybe we'll get the chance!  It's been fun chatting!,12/28/1983 0:42
1332,1858," It was fun talking to you as well, it's a bit sad that the plan to colonize Mars is being funded by reality TV and not our government.",5/24/2017 7:33
1332,1858, That is sadly true.  I'm with you there.  Have a great day!,12/19/2009 17:11
1332,1858," Hello, do you know much about the planets?",8/29/2016 23:39
1332,1332," Hi! I know a little bit here and there! How about you? I'm a huge fan of Jupiter. In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.",11/22/1998 17:43
1333,556, That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season,5/10/1990 9:05
1333,556, Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin.,3/18/1985 10:21
1333,1333, And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary,3/11/1997 14:40
1333,556, Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here. Did you hear that astronomers detected a planetary system with building blocks of life roughly 455 lightyears away?,12/9/1984 22:18
1333,556," I am so curious about that, so intrigued. How about planet earth? Too bad we have already destroyed 80% of the forests in it",7/15/1994 7:07
1333,1333," I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting. ",4/14/1973 22:17
1333,1333, It is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all. What a shame. When earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long. Can you imagine that?,3/28/1990 15:17
1333,556, Wow! I honestly couldn't. We would never have time to accomplish anything! Ha! Can you also believe earth will be basically free of helium when the 21st century ends?,8/11/1991 4:32
1333,1333, Yeah that is crazy to me. What about those balloons? Do you believe in extraterrestrials?,3/15/2007 19:23
1333,1333," Well, since the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, I believe they do expect to make contact eventually. It would truly be neat to see!",5/7/1985 8:49
1334,1334," I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch",12/29/1993 0:19
1334,1334, That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible?,8/26/2003 13:16
1334,1853," Science is moving pretty fast, you never know. And there seem to be organisms that can live in Mars like lichens and cyanobacteria",3/1/2000 10:59
1334,1853," Speaking of living on Mars, there's a reality show that's funding a colonization project aimed for 2023. That's going to be interesting to see. Ha!",9/28/1991 6:08
1334,1853," Wow, yeah it sounds like it. Did you heat about that confusion between the metric and the imperial system that Locheed Martin did?",6/19/2000 13:49
1334,1853, I heard a bit about it. I know they sadly lost a satellite on Mars because of it. It's like that sounds like a very costly mistake.,9/26/2021 21:10
1334,1853, Yup is sure seems to have been so. Do you know why Mars is referred to as the red planet?,10/16/1970 22:04
1334,1853, I do and it's because of the red colored iron oxide on the surface that stands out  among the astronomical bodies to the casual eye. Did you know Mars actually has its own polar ice caps as well?,4/16/1980 8:47
1334,1334," SO cool, I hope they keep exploring the planet. Nice chatting",7/19/1983 19:00
1334,1853," Hi, do you want to chat about Mars? Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet.",4/7/1986 21:53
1335,26," I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is.",8/22/2012 2:01
1335,1335," Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.",6/24/2015 5:00
1335,26," I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too.",3/20/1984 4:22
1335,1335," Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.",9/20/2013 19:53
1335,1335," Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable. ",9/7/1989 18:36
1335,26," Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.",3/11/2007 12:47
1335,1335," That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there?",10/18/1971 12:36
1335,26," If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show.",1/18/1985 18:34
1335,1335, I would not want to be the first there. Couldn't pay me enough.,1/27/1973 22:35
1335,1335," If you would fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days to get there.",2/21/2002 19:26
1336,331, That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it.,12/15/1978 21:32
1336,331, I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway.,4/4/2005 17:05
1336,331, I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.,11/22/1971 14:30
1336,331, Depends on a lot of factors.  Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system. ,6/27/1974 20:24
1336,1336, That was a serious oversight. How can scientists and engineers ever use that outdated system? I'm surprised. ,9/12/1982 16:53
1336,1336," Talk about crazy, did you know that more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?",11/20/2019 18:14
1336,331, We are destroying our home so fast. Can we put forests on Mars? Doubtful. We can't even do it here.,4/17/2008 5:45
1336,331," Good point, did you know also that earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century?",8/25/2002 3:27
1336,331," Yes, we'll have to get it from fusion reactors or from the sun. Whichever is easier. Anyway, great chat!",6/5/1986 3:57
1336,331," Yes, great chat!",7/20/2021 13:05
1337,794, Did you know the Justin Bieber songs? Specially his famous song baby baby song.,9/17/1979 12:14
1337,1337," No I didn't know that, I did like his songs when he first started singing as he got older, I got a little less Interesting.",12/6/2017 19:47
1337,794, He was singed to RBMG in 2008.,9/29/2011 3:49
1337,1337," I am not too familiar with the letter RBMG, was that his girlfriend? What does RBMG mean?",12/8/1998 1:26
1337,794, Taj Mahal is bigger than the white house.,10/20/2005 16:09
1337,794," Wow, I didn't know that, did you know the president's guest house is larger that the white house? What do you think about Robots?",12/25/1983 15:55
1337,1337, i think president's guest house is small,6/16/2010 22:05
1337,794," I have lived in Washington DC and have never seen the guest house, but I was shock when I read upon it. Do you think it dangerous for men to built robots like human to go into dangerous places?",3/26/1997 14:09
1337,794," Definitely, it was very dangerous.",3/30/1997 15:14
1337,1337," Did you know that Amazon ceo built a clock into the mountain that should run for 10,000 years?",9/29/2001 14:50
1338,1338," Wow, it's wonderful. But i don't know.",1/17/1971 15:53
1338,1338, Did you also know that the first Amazon.com first customer spent $27.95 got a building after him? that's something to think about.,10/19/1988 14:40
1338,1338, I think the first customer was john wainwright.,7/6/2015 3:38
1338,1338," Oh ok, did you know a single Google search required more computing power that It took to send Neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon? ",5/23/1990 23:42
1338,1338, i don't know about it.,10/13/2020 9:17
1338,780," I don't either, do you used google alot? Is google one of your most used website for such as YouTube and maps?",8/15/1989 0:42
1338,780," Yes, i used google alot. It's very useful.",10/11/2003 9:33

1338,1338, Cozmo is not only a must-have toy for all kids aged 8 and up. The robot was very safe.,9/27/2003 8:31
1338,1338," I think the message was talking about adult robots and robots that used manufacture, as I saw on TV once.",1/28/1988 10:28
1339,270, Okay. I also watch tv and social medias only.,8/18/1976 1:48
1339,1339," Ok, It was good chatting with you.",9/10/1982 18:39
1339,1339, Hello! Are you interested in astronomy? I just learned some interesting facts about Mars.,4/3/1984 8:08
1339,1339," I am interested, I think the universe is full with wonders! what did you learn about Mars please tell me.",1/22/2005 10:37
1339,270," I heard that in 2023, a Mars colonization project will launch! It'll be funded by a reality show based off the project. I would love to see something like that!",10/1/2003 20:12
1339,270," It would be nice to see indeed, although Im not sure if they are going to make, its going to be interesting since episode 1",5/23/1990 7:56
1339,1339," Agreed. That is a pretty major undertaking, I would be surprised if it worked out. Do you know any cool facts about Mars or Earth? I know a little bit. It's terrible, over 80% of the natural forests on Earth have been destroyed, I think mostly by humans.",1/10/2003 21:29
1339,270," That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation",7/3/2008 18:26
1339,270, That's so interesting! I guess the Earth was a lot smaller then. Sometimes I think about whether there's life beyond Earth. The UN actually appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the event that ETs ever made contact with humans.,5/10/1973 4:08
1339,1339," Thats interesting, I think there is life outside earth, the universe is just too big. ",11/21/1972 17:56
1340,1340," Agreed. Even if there's no other life in our Solar System, I have to believe that somewhere in the entire vast universe that life exists. Humans definitely have a fascination with the idea of ET life. It's interesting how sometimes people are scared of aliens (like in the movie Alien) and sometimes people see aliens as friends (like the movie ET)",1/7/1996 15:54
1340,1746," And I bet aliens are totally different from what we have imagined, I would like to go to Jupiter it has a moon that could be considered a planet",11/16/1988 11:10
1340,1746," Wow, that must be really large! I think I heard it would be a planet if it orbited the sun, but since it just orbits Jupiter it doesn't qualify as one. Moons are so powerful, Earth's moon is what causes the tides and stabilizes Earth's axis you know.",7/24/1985 13:36
1340,1340," I know! our moon influences life on earth in many ways, we sure are lucky to have one. ",4/21/1982 21:24
1340,1746, Yes. I wonder what life would be like without the moon. You know there was a red moon the other week? I saw it through a telescope and it was so beautiful. I think that's caused by a lunar eclipse but I'm not sure exactly.,6/28/1972 8:52
1340,1340," I didn't see it, too bad that I missed it, I didn't know that was possible and it would be nice to watch the universe from Mars.",5/22/1970 3:49
1340,1340," That's a really interesting perspective, I never thought of that. Well maybe if that colonization project goes through, eventually we COULD end up watching the universe from Mars!",11/8/1977 3:21
1340,1340," I hope I can live to see that, earth is going to be helium free by the end of this century!",3/24/1980 14:37
1340,1340, That's crazy! Do we humans need helium to survive? Hopefully the scientists can figure out a way to prevent that from happening. ,2/27/1979 10:18
1340,1340," I dont think we do but not having helium might have an effect on something we do need to exist, its amazing how 71% of earth is water.",9/13/1976 7:23
1341,1341," That's a lot of water. And I'm pretty sure the sea level is rising because of global warming and the ice caps melting. We need to take better care of our planet, we're going to run it into the ground if we're not careful!",5/18/1976 2:47
1341,845," I agree, if we don't take care of it it might end up like Venus although a cool thing about venus is that it does not tilt.",9/13/1999 7:24
1341,845," I did not know that. I did know that Uranus rotates sideways and doesn't spin like the other planets, but rather rolls around the sun!",10/26/1988 9:32
1341,845," Thats a really interesting fact about Uranus, well I heard astromers already detected life 455 light years away from us.",12/24/1995 14:59
1341,1341," Hello. Can you believe The Onion voted Kum Jong Un as the sexiest man alive, and China actually believed that nonsense?",11/19/1992 19:48
1341,1341," No way! I didn't see that! I love reading articles about that part of the world, though. Like, did you read about the missile alert in Hawaii?",1/14/1971 12:44
1341,845," Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea.",11/27/1984 6:25
1341,1341, I bet he won't shoot a missile!,7/27/2007 17:50
1341,1341," I don't put anything past him. Even though we don't know how old he is, he is very intelligent and knows his way around arms.",2/3/1989 7:06
1341,845, You're right about that. He may not make the rational decisions you might expect from other leaders.,7/6/1981 3:18
1342,490," He does have a degree in physics, that alone makes him dangerous, when you factor in all the military equipment he has to play with.",9/16/1992 12:40
1342,1342," In addition to the physics degree, he received one as at a military university. Plus, since his father and grandfather were leaders, you might assume that he has been aware of military and political strategies from a very young age, don't you think?",9/10/1993 22:37
1342,1342," I don't know. DPK is such a secretive country. Supposedly, he learned how to drive at 3.",9/10/1998 14:56
1342,1342," At 3?! I wonder if he missed out on his childhood experiences, and that is why he is spending so much money on renovating theme parks in North Korea?",2/5/2022 12:31
1342,490," I honestly don't know much about the country, or him. I'm still marveling that trump met with him.",9/12/1990 11:42
1342,1342," Indeed! I truly didn't think that 2018 would see a US President visit with the North Korean leader, or that  the North Korean leader would visit South Korea for the first time since the end of the Korean War. What a strange year.",8/27/1991 23:28
1342,1342," In Hawaii, the official business shirt is an aloha shirt. Much better look than a suit and tie, in the tropics, have you been?",6/23/2018 4:07
1342,1342, Is that right? I didn't know that. I have never visited Hawaii yet. I hope to go some day. It would take a long time though. Did you know air travel is actually slower now than in the 1960's to save on fuel costs?,7/13/1973 15:06
1342,490," I didn't know that. I know that Japan is crazy expensive to travel, as they have mainly toll roads.",7/31/1983 20:59
1342,1342, I didn't know about the toll roads. I visited Japan and only took trains. there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling. That can help make it less expensive.,3/30/2019 16:44
1343,1343," I wouldn't want people crashing on mine, or be comfortable crashing. It's weird that there aren't that many cars in Iceland. Or buses.",9/22/1975 20:45
1343,1343, Why do you think that is so? Is it because people travel by train or boat?,8/12/1970 11:44
1343,237, I think it's because it is a small country. They fly a lot though.,2/24/1978 12:57
1343,237," I see. I thought they might travel by ship. Did you know that during the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers? I can't think of anything like that now. ",10/21/1991 21:34
1343,237," Yes. They released pigs and chickens as well. Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful night.",9/29/1993 9:40
1343,1343," Thank you, you as well!",3/31/1972 3:41
1343,237," Bye, now.",2/22/1979 23:29
1343,237, Good bye!,10/13/1976 5:58
1343,237, Bye.,3/30/2003 3:57
1343,237, I can',5/19/2015 17:23
1344,1925," Hi! Do you play video games? Did you know that it's illegal in South Korea for kids under 16 to play video games? I wonder how kids in America would take that, if that became a law here, haha. ",5/24/2018 10:17
1344,1344," oh wow, that is weird I don't like that, I played lots of games as a kid what about you?",12/24/2012 12:57
1344,1344," I know, I agree with you! yes, i till play from time to time I enjoy a good solo game of zombies, it gets my heart racing. Video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military, another fun fact for ya. ",11/23/1990 6:02
1344,1344, that is fun! kind of sad that humans as a whole play games for 3 billion hours a week,8/30/2009 10:27
1344,1344," This is true! and I'm sure as video games progress and evolve we will lose touch of reality, what is reality anyway? Another cool game out there Little Big Planet was narrated by Stephen Fry. He also narrated hitchhiker guide to the galaxy and harry potter video games. Little Big Planet though is a fun Family game.",11/29/2006 2:43
1344,1344," ah thats cool, I do like that game, did you ever play a toy story game? Tom Hanks brother does all the voices actually",8/19/2014 22:29
1344,1344," No I have not, some theorists categorize video games as a form of art, but this designation is controversial. I was a hardcore Nintendo Super Mario girl. I still Love that game.",5/1/1988 6:48
1344,1925, haha that game is amazing and I agree they are an art form! do you watch any judge judy btw,7/25/1986 5:42
1344,1344," agreed, and Yes I have, I hear she makes about 123,000 an episode! yes, please! She makes almost as much as Lebron.",9/26/2017 4:34
1344,1925," thats nuts! yup the second highest paid celebrity, I wonder how much Robin Williams made for doing the genie in aladdin",9/4/1990 16:03
1345,540," Im not sure, but surely a heck of a lot, he was a famous celebrity by then. He was probably one of the few to be able to enter Pixar's studio secret room.",3/19/1970 14:13
1345,540," haha ya I agree, did you watch Sesame street as a kid? I never knew the first celebrity on the show was Carol Burnett",9/1/1981 2:19
1345,540," Interesting! well you know, celebrity status is often associated with wealth and PERKS! How cool!",7/3/2011 22:56
1345,540, indeed! did you hear about the planet that rains molten glass on it? Thats one place I dont want to visit haha,5/12/1978 9:44
1345,540," I am so glad to be a part of this Planet! uuf! I cant imagine living there either. I dislike winter to the core but 4500 mph and 2000 degree fahrenheit weather, no Thanks! ",1/30/2003 19:30
1345,540," ya I'm ok where I am haha, I would like to travel to venus, I guess it doesn't tilt and thus has no seasons",11/2/1989 19:12
1345,1345," I wonder if venus made it to the planets that remain from the original planets discovered before the 50's, its crazy how much has changed. We now have Ceres, Pallas and Juno amongst others as celestial bodies, mind blowing  know.",4/18/2011 0:07
1345,540," that is crazy, also its crazy that its the only planet to rotate clockwise, like why is that haha",7/27/1995 18:05
1345,540, and apparently it's only 455 light years away! ha The universe is amazing.,7/26/1997 18:04
1345,540," haha well that is the planet that has potential life on it, I think Venus is much closer, but its all good!",11/6/1987 2:02
1346,1346," I should try going out more, they say that five planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye. ",8/19/2013 23:12
1346,1346," wow that is cool, and I always wondered why Pluto was excluded and I guess it was from the 2006 decision where scientists formally outlined the classifications of planets",7/26/1972 15:34
1346,557, I just had a long day of playing video games. How was your day?,12/10/1985 22:54
1346,1346," Hello,  sounds rough,  hope you can make it through the convo lol My day has been pretty great,  cant complain.  Did you know there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways?",8/9/1975 18:43
1346,557, Did not know that! It seems to me that you are interested in space?,6/8/1982 0:00
1346,1346, I like space.  Not enough to be hugely educated in it though lol I know Jupiter's storms can be heard on an Am radio though!  Never actually listened to it. ,7/29/1977 3:05
1346,1346," Do you believe that life exists outside of Earth? I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away.",4/28/1983 15:48
1346,1346," Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life. ",5/14/1977 4:23
1346,557, I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there!,1/7/2004 2:27
1346,557," I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.  We are so tiny. ",1/26/1976 0:15
1347,1826, We definitely are. Have you ever seen the movie Wall-E? Some of it takes place on a spaceship!,8/11/1973 3:36
1347,1826, I have seen it but I dont remember all of it lol.  ,7/17/1983 11:14
1347,1347, I just love that movie. I love Pixar. Did you know that they have a secret room that is often visited by celebrities?,7/25/1974 16:44
1347,1347," I did,  Ive always wondered what was in there lol I hope free sandwiches lol ",11/28/1982 20:07
1347,1826, I'm sure there are. Celebrities have a lot of perks. Wish I was one!,10/7/1987 1:47
1347,1347," Robin Williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  That seems fun,  I wouldnt mind being a voice actor,  I do not want to be a celebrity at all,  just rich lol Seems like they have a tough life. ",2/10/1971 8:11
1347,1826," Yeah, but being rich takes a load of stress off of your shoulders. For example, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode!",6/29/1973 5:27
1347,1826," Yeah thats why I would just want to be rich,  i dont care about being a celebrity at all. ",3/24/2002 4:19
1347,1826," Well, I guess normal people have it easy. We can just play video games all day!",9/16/2011 15:42
1347,1826, Tom Hanks' brother does the Woody voice in the video games and merchandise. ,1/16/2002 21:16
1348,494, Interesting! I guess kids in South Korea have it rough. It's illegal for them to play video games past midnight.,6/15/1970 9:07
1348,494," Wow really,  I had no idea,  I wonder how they regulate that ",7/8/2017 1:35
1348,494, Same here! I think I'm going to go play more video games now. It was great chatting with you!,9/14/2022 15:50
1348,494, Wonderful chatting with you as well. ,3/2/1984 19:00
1348,1348, Hello.   What do you think of Pluto-planet or not?,10/17/2009 3:51
1348,1348, If it were up to me it would be a planet. Seems silly to deem it otherwise.,8/2/2015 4:03
1348,494, I agree.  I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit.,8/22/1994 20:33
1348,494," Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything",9/18/2010 14:24
1348,1348, True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition.,9/2/2006 20:48
1348,1348," Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy.",2/12/2001 9:22
1349,1349, I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?  ,3/1/2021 21:38
1349,1665," Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them.",4/28/2001 12:41
1349,1349, That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather?,10/29/1980 22:07
1349,1665," Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed.",5/20/2018 18:33
1349,1665, Yes we would.  For something odd closer to home we've got Venus with it's no seasons.,11/2/1974 11:08
1349,1349, Do you play video games? I play probably way more than I should haha.,1/2/2016 1:51
1349,1665, I do play some. I play more on my phone nowadays though.  It's said that we play three billion hours of video games a week.,6/17/1983 8:53
1349,1349," I mainly play on pc and I play a ton of a game called League of Legends, I have over 4k hours, pretty crazy how addicting games can be.",4/18/1986 17:44
1349,1665, That's for sure.  I have to say though that I don't agree with some people that games are an art form.,4/17/1989 1:42
1349,1349," it really depends on the game, for it to be art it really needs to stand out, but really games are not more art than a movie is.",2/14/2010 19:44
1350,1350, Did you know that video games were initially used by the military?,4/29/1985 3:23
1350,1350," Yeah I can see that, they are good training for certain things, like hand eye coordination. Video games also make more money annually than all Hollywood films.",3/1/2016 14:00
1350,1350," Even still, South Korea has a law that it's illegal for kids under 16 to play video games past midnight.",1/26/2015 17:40
1350,1350," Well Korea is huge for pro game players, so it's not a surprise they have more regulations on it. I also think chuck e cheese is horrible for children and I think it promotes gambling at a very early age.",9/13/1985 5:44
1350,543," Speaking of early ages, Toy Story video games actually have Tom Hanks brother as Woody and not him.",4/3/1986 0:26
1350,1350," Hello there, do you play video games much these days?",10/10/2018 22:21
1350,1350, Not really... I hear it's illegal in S. Korea for kids 16 and under to play after midnight.  That rule works for me...,3/16/1985 12:08
1350,1350," That is very interesting, I wonder if any other countries around the world have similar rules. ",12/6/2015 22:56
1350,1350, Probably... I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise...,4/4/1975 10:51
1350,543," Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call!",11/29/1976 4:57
1351,1351, I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called cathode ray tube amusement devices by the military... Yawn...,1/13/1981 15:08
1351,1189, Yeah I don't think they imagined there would be multimillion dollar stadiums built for them. ,2/10/1993 23:25
1351,1351, What was the military even doing with them?  Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons?,4/24/2005 9:43
1351,1351," That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well. ",6/29/2020 11:26
1351,1351," For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to roll around the sun. ",1/1/1987 20:18
1351,1351," Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol. ",10/15/1997 10:40
1351,1189," I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun.",8/10/1981 20:59
1351,1351, Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph!,12/21/1979 7:15
1351,1351," Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella... I guess signs of life have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.  Very far, far away...",2/9/2021 20:57
1351,1189," That doesn't seem too far away in the whole of space, very interesting, I wonder what our technology will reveal in the next 10 years or so. ",1/30/1998 21:14
1352,1352, It's small condiering the universe and very far for Earthlings.  We can't even fathom going to Proxima Centarti 4+ light-years away.  So are you into celebrities?,10/6/2004 4:17
1352,1326," Oh yeah for sure far for us as humans, I would really say I am, I don't get all the hype.  How about you?",11/20/2020 21:44
1352,1326, Most of them have pissed me off with their force-fed moronic political views.  I do miss Robin Williams.  I didn't realize he was the voice of Aladdin and the 1st to start that trend. ,6/8/1996 15:47
1352,1352," Oh yeah, I miss him dearly, he seemed a different breed of most of those types, and yeah he was awesome in that!",2/17/2003 22:45
1352,1352, Did ya know Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities?  Wonder what's in there?,5/15/2017 1:03
1352,1352," No but I wonder the same, I wonder what kinds of things they would have in there?  ",3/18/2000 6:55
1352,1326," I guess it's not for us mere mortals... Wow, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode for doing what she would be doing off-camera. ",2/9/1988 6:51
1352,1352," That is insane!  Oh judge Judy wonder what you do with all your money lol.  Anyways, it's been good talking, I hope you have a good night!",12/12/2010 6:07
1352,1326, Hey have you ever seen Justin Timberlake in concert before?,7/3/2017 12:42
1352,1326, No.  I have not.  I am not really much into pop music.  It seems like he has been around forever.,12/22/2019 15:15
1353,1353," Yeah he's been around for a while, he's actually going to perform at the Capital One Arena very soon. His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way",9/24/1987 15:03
1353,1353, Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell?,12/6/1998 19:53
1353,1353, Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though,12/11/2000 13:09
1353,1353," Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are empty because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective.",12/20/1978 17:55
1353,1353, Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album ,9/21/1996 21:13
1353,958, Pink Floyd The Wall is my favorite.  Did you know The Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours?,5/25/1971 21:18
1353,958," Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now",1/29/2013 20:57
1353,958," I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton?",8/2/1992 8:27
1353,1353, I think it's a great album! It's crazy that it went platinum without getting any AirPlay or without them doing a tour,2/6/1993 11:43
1353,958, Do you think that the movie by the same name had anything to do with it going platinum?,4/2/1990 12:10
1354,334, Yes I think it went platinum before the movie came out haha. Have you heard about the famous Japanese rappers though? They are twins and also 100 years old,6/23/2012 22:02
1354,1354," That's hilarious!  But it shows the international reach of pop music.  I remember South Korean Gangnam Style was big here, I believe in 2012.  Did  you N. Korea has its own girl pop band?",1/29/1979 14:40
1354,334," No I didn't, I wonder if there are any good? Have you heard them play any songs",1/10/1970 12:33
1354,1354," No I have not heard N. Koreas Moranbong Band.  For them to even exist they must sing praises of the Kim dynasty.  Switching to geeks, did you know scientist have voted Queens We are the Champions as the catchiest pop song of all time?",12/7/1999 17:47
1354,334, No I didn't hear about that. But it makes sense that song is always stuck in my head haha. Do you ever play the guitar by the way?,1/29/2014 9:41
1354,334," No.  I spent more time out hunting, fishing, roping, and riding.  But I do like to go hear the jazz / blues guitarists in New Orleans from time to time.  In my youth, Van Halen was one of my favs.  Did you know Eddie Van Halen recorded a guitar solo in which he set studio speakers on fire?  The song was Beat It.  He sure beat up those speakers!!!!",2/11/2022 8:09
1354,1354, I heard about that! He actually set the speakers on fire because his solo was so awesome LOL that's hilarious,12/1/1988 23:59
1354,1354, What I never figured out is the acts that smash guitars.  I guess because I am a bit of a tightwad and would never intentionally smash something that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.  Matthew Bellamy with use holds the Guinness World Record for that!  ,12/16/1987 16:51
1354,1354," Yeah I think that's a really dumb record, but I guess it's in the Guinness Book of World Records so oh well, what do you think about Queen's guitarist Brian made by the way? He has a PHD in astrophysics so he must be really smart",5/26/2021 11:03
1354,1354, Do you like Justin Timberlake?  He has a tour called Man of the Woods?,11/27/2008 3:25
1355,1355," I have never been that huge of a fan, but I have heard his concerts are amazing.  I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan?",3/15/1982 13:47
1355,1180," No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour.",5/25/1999 9:00
1355,1355," Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate.",4/28/2009 10:56
1355,1180, Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much. ,9/30/1982 18:12
1355,1180," I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that many people enjoy empty fun.  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society!",9/29/2020 2:03
1355,1180, I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done.,3/30/1992 5:17
1355,1355," Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released!",11/6/1971 16:25
1355,1355," Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames.",9/4/1983 20:36
1355,1180," Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century.",1/30/1998 20:23
1355,1180, What happened to them?  I know Hybrid Theory was the album of which you speak. ,12/4/2001 8:58
1356,1356, *Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently.,5/3/2011 9:19
1356,837," Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992.",8/2/2009 14:05
1356,837, That is remarkable!  Sounds about as wild as the president of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums while in office!,8/24/2000 9:17
1356,837," Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song We are the Champions as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy...",11/13/2007 19:37
1356,837, Me too :(  Those were the good old days.  When Eddie Van Halen literally set fire to the speakers when recording Beat It.,3/10/2007 22:19
1356,1356," His amp must have gone to 11 like in the movie Spinal Tap.  Funny, Ricky Gervals was a pop singer in the 1980's. ",5/2/2011 5:17
1356,1356, I cannot picture that!  They all have interesting quirks.  LIke Brian May using coins instead of guitar picks.,2/26/2009 12:53
1356,837," Or Matthew Bellamy from Muse destroying so many guitars.  Sad, he should donate them to a good cause.  That's been done, move on...",2/1/1982 17:51
1356,837, I agree.  He actually owns the Guinness world record for most guitars smashed!  Not ideal!,3/13/1977 21:07
1356,1356," I agree.  Do something unique at least.  I think the Who did that, Hendrix set one on fire... Old news.  ",6/30/2009 12:38
1357,175," Yup, I am with you!  It was a pleasure chatting today!",3/18/2021 13:48
1357,1357, Are you a big fan of dancing? ,6/10/1971 4:56
1357,1357, Huge fan! I like the cha-cha. You?,3/7/1983 17:17
1357,175," Yeah I am, I used to go out dancing with my ex quite a bit.  Did you know Tupac danced ballet in hight school?",1/17/1989 1:57
1357,175, I did not that is very interesting! I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer.,3/29/2022 22:51
1357,175," Yes, I have heard that before about Bruce Lee, that guy was super talented. ",11/5/2004 3:31
1357,1357, My baby also is a great dancer and seems to follow the beat!,6/4/1988 10:23
1357,175, Wow! That must be really fun to watch. I was always a fan of Michael Jackson's dancing. ,8/2/2005 20:20
1357,1357, He was a legend in dancing! I am pretty fascinated by the moon how about you?,10/1/2006 15:27
1357,175," Yes I am.  I didn't know moon dust causes moon hay fever, did you?",11/25/2005 6:45
1358,1623, I did not I thought the space suit was solely for oxygen but I guess it is also to protect them. The moon is not flat you know the tallest point is almost 2000 meters higher than Mt Everest.,2/16/1989 12:24
1358,1358," Wow! I did not know that, very interesting.  I guess some people believed one of Mar's moons was artificial!",5/5/2016 2:08
1358,1623, There is all kinds of funny ideas such as the moon landing being fake. They have found methane based life on titan!,6/14/2009 2:09
1358,1358," Yeah I've definitely heard those before, and wow! That is exciting to hear. ",10/14/1971 5:43
1358,1623, I am also big into playing the piano do you play?,3/7/1997 8:33
1358,1623," No, I do not, but always wanted to learn.  I think it is an awesome instrument.  How long have you played?",10/21/2013 13:15
1358,1358," I have played 20 years, The hindenburg blimp had a piano built for the lounge!",8/14/2020 4:59
1358,1358," That is very impressive, I'm sure you are quite talented.  And wow, whenever I think of blimps I think of the Indiana Jones movie.  ",7/10/2017 13:52
1358,1623, There was a group of climbers that climbed Britain's tallest mountain and found a piano on top!,11/9/1983 11:34
1358,1358, That is the craziest fact I have heard so far.  I wonder why someone would do that. ,8/5/1980 5:59
1359,1359, I don't know but it is pretty cool! Pianos are very old instruments created in 1700!!,11/22/1988 4:47
1359,1359," That is old, I wonder how much some of those pianos if they are still around are worth today?",7/3/1993 20:32
1359,1359, I would imagine quite a lot! I enjoyed chatting with you I must run now though.,12/21/1986 11:10
1359,171," Thank you, I did as well.  Thanks for the timely responses. ",2/11/1977 4:41
1359,1359, Your welcome good bye.,8/29/2012 14:14
1359,1359," Hello, are you a Tupac fan? I am and wasn't aware he was a ballet dancer in High school",1/17/1988 8:53
1359,1359," I'm not the biggest fan of rap, admittedly, but I do like some of his work.  Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes!",11/19/2015 6:50
1359,1359, They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves.,9/6/2002 0:32
1359,1359," Wonder if that how he was able to do that extreme lean move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)  Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer?",8/14/1970 9:09
1359,171, He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha in 1958. my kids do the cha cha slide in Call of Duty.,3/29/1997 16:50
1360,734," Hehe. That's funny.  Speaking of kids, they say even babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.  I saw a youtube video once of a baby jamming out to Gangnum Style by Psy.  LOL",2/17/2002 4:13
1360,1360," That is cute when they do that. I didn't know that moon dust is so sharp, it can cut through kevlar.",8/19/2021 17:07
1360,1360," Not just that, but they say it can give you Moon Hay Fever.  Had no idea there was moon hay fever... that just sounds both scary and nutty... ",10/11/2018 11:23
1360,1360," Yeah, it does. I can't believe NASA thought about placing a UN flag on the moon, instead of the American flag.",5/30/1975 7:03
1360,1360," Ahhh... forget that!  As far as I know, the UN didn't help the US get to the moon.  Grrr... don't get started on the subject of the UN, trying to watch my blood pressure!  :)  Speaking of moons, did you know Phobos (Mars' moon) is one third hollow?  ",2/7/2019 5:26
1360,1360, I've always wondered how they know things like this. Especially when you think that they once thought it was hollow.,6/15/1979 3:58
1360,1360," That I can't tell ya.. it's just amazing all the stuff they've been able to discover just by telescopes and pictures.  Heck, they believe there's evidence of methane based life on Satan's moon, Titan.  That'd be pretty amazing if they can confirm it!",11/3/1984 21:33
1360,1360," If they were smart, they would stay hidden. Oddly, an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindenburg. I wonder how it sounded?",10/29/2009 19:35
1360,734," That's a good question, dunno if making it out of aluminum would make it sound different or not.  Like with violins.  There's a noticeable difference in sound with them depending on the type of wood used...",10/22/2015 14:31
1360,734," I don't know much about them, as neither of my kids play piano. It's interesting that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record songs on",5/19/1982 5:19
1361,459," That'd probably make it one of the most valuable piano's ever (if it was up for sale, that is.)  Speaking of piano, did you know there's a song designed for stress testing auto-pianos?  It's called Circus Galop.  You can hear it on Youtube if you're interested...",4/14/1996 3:08
1361,1361, I did not. I wonder how a piano got to the top of Britains highest mountain?,1/24/2002 16:23
1361,459," My guess?  Pranksters!  LOL.  I mean, seriously, who looks at a huge mountain, and says, Hey, lets get a piano up there!  ",6/21/1977 1:14
1361,459," That sounds very difficult. I've hiked the AT, and have left water behind, because it added too much weight. The BBC once decided there was nothing worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.",7/31/1983 17:53
1361,459, The AT?  What's that?  Must have been a REAL slow news day.  Way the news is today I think sometimes I'd rather listen to piano music instead!,7/30/2012 18:35
1361,459," I know I would. Thank you for chatting with me today, have a wonderful day.",2/12/2012 12:07
1361,1361," Hey, you too!  Take care!",12/27/2011 12:11
1361,1361, Thank you,3/6/2004 6:29
1361,1361, Maybe we'll chat again sometime!,12/13/2015 13:35
1361,1361," Maybe, lol",3/22/2021 21:01
1362,1362," So, be safe!  The weather's been a little crazy around parts of the country.",5/25/1997 16:13
1362,1362, Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?,3/9/1995 6:54
1362,1362," No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.  ",4/8/2000 16:20
1362,1778, Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,8/20/1993 1:26
1362,1778, Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.  ,4/13/2016 18:40
1362,1778, It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school.,3/8/2015 0:58
1362,1778," Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.  ",4/7/2021 9:59
1362,1778," That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it.",6/2/2006 16:46
1362,1362, Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.  ,6/30/1997 15:03
1362,1362," I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old.",11/23/2011 10:50
1363,1762," Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.  ",10/24/2009 21:54
1363,1762, That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material.,6/3/2009 16:53
1363,1363, Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.  ,1/20/1983 10:11
1363,1762, My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.,7/7/1977 15:30
1363,1762, Do you think parrots can dance to the sound of a piano?  It crazy to think that steam piano's used to exist and I hear they are very loud.  ,8/24/2013 2:53
1363,1363, They can move with the beat. There is a gorgeous pianist named Lola Anastanove or something like that that I saw on Youtube.  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Paul McCartney used for Hey Jude.,10/15/1972 0:10
1363,1762, Interesting fact!  I saw a Youtube video about a mute man who was found wandering the streets in England and the only way he could communicate was via piano.  ,3/28/1988 22:37
1363,1762, In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.,9/25/2013 11:40
1363,1762, How in the world could a piano have been placed there?  Fun piano fact.  Mozart and Haydn two of the biggest composers of the classical era each owned a piano made from the same tree.  ,4/3/2010 13:32
1363,1363," That is a fun fact.  I would guess a helicopter on the piano placement.  They needed a light grand piano on the Hindenburg, so they made one of aluminum and it weighed 356 pounds.",5/24/1979 18:14
1364,881, All these fun piano facts and to think Italy was the county that invented the piano.  ,4/7/2000 7:37
1364,1364," We have a 7 ft 6 inch grand in our house.  It is a great instrument.  Don't forget to look up Lola, the greatest female pianist of the day.. Nice talking with you.",10/17/2001 23:43
1364,881, Dance is a performance of art selected of human movement. It is the birth place so many exercise movement without the equipment.,12/31/1972 18:07
1364,1364," Awesome, I agree. I love to dance. It's aesthetic and loved by all cultures across the world.",10/2/2012 21:38
1364,881, The dance movement differ from culture to culture but all movement are unique it is very interesting to watch it. style is also important.,8/24/2005 7:13
1364,881," Yes, I heard that Bruce Lee was actually a great dancer and the Cha Cha championship in 1958. Never would have guessed that!",6/2/1981 16:19
1364,1364," Yes, Babies dance when they hear music its very wonderful. The body more flexible while dancing and it can reduce stress.",5/17/1977 2:13
1364,1364," Yes, that must be a pleasure reflex that music promotes in us even as babies. Did you hear that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week?",3/27/1992 17:07
1364,881," Its very interesting! Dance can be described by its choreography, to repeat the movement.",9/16/1976 11:23
1364,1364," Yes, did you know that Tupac danced ballet in his high school and ended up playing the Mouse King in the Nutcracker in his high school production? That's unbelievable. I never would have guessed that one.",10/7/2013 15:09
1365,1365, The moon is the satellite of the earth which is natural satellite. It is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system.,9/2/2002 21:52
1365,797, Did you know that moon dust is dangerous? It is harmful to humans and causes a disease call moon hay fever ? Wow on that one too!,11/16/1972 0:47
1365,797, Its very dangerous. Jupiter planet have many number of satellite. The saturn planet have rings.,5/13/1975 7:12
1365,797, Wow. Did you know that the moon's highest point is even higher than Mt. Everest  by 1938 meters? Now that's high!,10/30/1984 15:14
1365,1365, The shape of the moon keep changing from every 15 days. New moon to full moon and then full moon to new moon. We are facing only one side of the moon.,12/7/2021 8:27
1365,797," Good to know. Yes, we are on the Light Side of the Moon which orbits our planet.  Apparently, NASA considered placing a UN instead of an American flag on the moon for Apollo 11.",12/20/2010 17:58
1365,1365," In moon, water is available in moisture form do you know ?",12/3/1986 22:32
1365,1365, I'm not sure about that one but I'd like to turn the conversation to the piano.  Did you know that it was only invented around the year 1700?,8/25/2018 14:08
1365,797," Amazing. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys the performer press the key. It is very interesting to hear the music of it.",6/24/2019 18:32
1365,797," I think so too. I have a few keyboards that I want to learn to play. I heard that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record his song Hey Jude. By the way, Bohemian Rhapsody is out in theaters this week or next, I think.",2/17/1978 18:04
1366,1520, You know how to play piano. Which is your favourite brand ?,7/17/1983 20:03
1366,1520," I have a Yamaha Portatone (an old one) and a Casio. Did you know that back in 1930, the BBC thought that there no news worth reporting so they just played piano music instead?  That is cool!",3/21/1979 19:17
1366,1520, In 2006 group of climbers reached the top of Britain highest mountain and found a piano.,12/21/1979 11:48
1366,1366, Piano's must soothe the savage soul if someone dragged one to the top of Britain's highest mountain. What a blast that must have been to find that!,10/26/1994 18:56
1366,1520," Solely for stress testing auto-pianos, and is not remotely playable by humans.",1/10/1974 6:01
1366,1366," Yes, I heard that's called the Circus Gallop!",2/23/2009 17:07
1366,1520, Its very interesting.,4/14/2008 20:11
1366,1366," Yes, I agree. I also found out that an aluminum piano was built for the Hindenburg airship and weighed 356 pounds. Cool.",8/26/2006 13:58
1366,1520, The scientist still have research about the moon and best of the different things.,4/2/1978 18:09
1366,1520," Yes, we still don't know everything we should but we just keep on keeping on.  Thanks for the great chat!",7/29/1980 17:10
1367,1961, Ok. Have a great day.,2/15/2003 5:05
1367,1367, Sure thing,6/29/1990 11:47
1367,1961, Do you like Linkin Park? To me they're one of those bands at the turn of the century who were like a holdover from 90s grunge.,10/8/1985 22:15
1367,1367, I like their first album hybrid theory which happens to be the best selling album of the 21st century,9/5/1991 2:29
1367,1367," Yeah, I loved it too. Also all the old album rock of the Progressive Rock era, when people really started listening to music as albums instead of singles. Did you ever do that trick with Dark Side of the Moon where you play it in sync to The Wizard of Oz?",4/3/2011 20:44
1367,1367," No I haven't, which trick was that?",10/28/1970 18:42
1367,1367," If you start the album and the movie playing at exactly the same time, the coincidences between the songs and the movie scenes are pretty weird.",7/25/2020 14:31
1367,1961," That is weird, not as weird as the President of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums though",4/2/2002 7:17
1367,1367," Yeah, I wonder if they were any good.",7/21/1999 3:45
1367,1961, Well the President of Indonesia did release 3,9/15/1983 4:22
1368,1368," I should do a YouTube search, now that my curiosity is aroused.",3/31/1988 13:22
1368,442," You should youtube Ricky Gervais too, he was a pop singer in the 80s",7/2/2021 19:19
1368,442," He's a comedian now, right?",1/15/1970 18:28
1368,442," Yea, he created the original UK version of the office after his pop singer days",11/11/1996 15:27
1368,442," Interesting. Do you play any musical instruments? I've idly thought about learning the guitar for a long time, but never took any serious steps toward it.",11/7/2012 7:38
1368,442, I tried to play guitar a few times but I suck at strumming the strings and using both hands,8/18/2012 18:56
1368,442," Yeah, Im pretty bad at coordination and multitasking so I should probably give up the idea too.",12/12/2016 8:23
1368,1368, I'd like to be a rockstar and light studio speakers on fire like eddie van halen did for beat it,7/25/1996 5:36
1368,442," I used to imagine myself doing the Eric Draven guitar solo scene in The Crow, LOL.",12/11/1991 5:34
1368,1368, Having a grand housboat on the River Thames like Pink Floyd's gutarist sounds awesome,11/27/2016 9:22
1369,1923, I wonder if that was Gilmour. I actually dreamed about listening to him last night. But to be honest I thought Pink Floyd wasn't as good as a Gilmour-led group after Waters left.,7/1/1991 4:45
1369,1923, Well maybe but they might still be preferred over the two identical twins from Japan who released a rap album when they turned 100,4/20/2012 5:33
1369,1369," Yeah, they sound creative. Nice chatting with you.",1/6/1979 12:49
1369,1369, You a Justin Timberlake fan? Sounds like his current tour is pretty cool.,2/14/1997 16:50
1369,1923, For a pop artist I don't mind JT. His Man in the Woods Tour? Which is album is that concert for?,7/17/1998 2:47
1369,1369, I'm not actually sure. I will have to look that up. But he played a lot of past songs too.,2/26/1972 8:44
1369,1923, Oh! I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album.,1/4/1997 5:33
1369,1369, Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club!,5/8/2018 8:27
1369,1369, Have you seen any of the movies he's been in?,4/4/2018 12:42
1369,1369, Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough.,10/8/2017 22:36
1370,1867, I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though.,3/14/1995 7:06
1370,1370, Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol. Wonder if he played the guitar?,11/5/2014 21:13
1370,1867, Haha I don't think so. His voices doesn't sound like it would translate to a singing voice at all. Although doesn't his character in The Office sing?,8/8/1986 10:14
1370,1867," Haha occasionally yes but not well. I just watched the movie about queen. The guitarist, Brian May, has a phd in astrophysics.",5/25/2008 18:58
1370,1867," I haven't seen that movie, but that band was incredibly talented. I heard the actor who played Freddie Mercury in it didn't sing the songs himself.",12/26/2002 0:44
1370,1370, No don't think he did. He won an oscar for it though. well deserved. Matthew Bellamy from the band muse holds the guiness world record for most guitars smashed on tour!,9/21/2019 5:19
1370,1867, That's cool! Muse is pretty underrated band. Super Massive Blackhole was a great album.,7/2/2016 3:20
1370,1370, Yeah I agree. Van Halen was also one of my favorites. He actually set the speakers on fire when he recorded beat it.,12/20/1986 1:30
1370,1867, Do you like rock music better than pop music?,4/30/2015 23:59
1370,1867, Yeah for sure. But I do like We are the champions which has been coined the catchiest pop music of all time.,4/9/1990 8:38
1371,1371, It's kind of sad that rock music has been forgotten. At the Grammy's you barely know rock music is still around based on how they present it.,1/28/1982 13:46
1371,919, True. It's all pop and rap. Even the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums.,3/31/1985 19:09
1371,1371, It's interesting that We are the Champions is considered a pop song. That doesn't seem right.,3/25/1982 11:57
1371,1371, Yes I thought the same thing. It should be rock. I don;t know what those scientists were thinking! It was great talking with you today!,6/18/1977 21:34
1371,919," Same, have a great weekend.",8/27/1974 8:53
1371,919, Hi. Did you know that moon dust can cut through kevlar like material?,1/24/2005 2:30
1371,919," No, that's fascinating. Did you know the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters taller than Mt. Everest?",3/27/1970 12:57
1371,919, I didn't know that.  It really makes you think about how it must be walking around on the moon doesn't it?,8/31/1994 22:36
1371,919," Yea, I wouldn't want to catch hay fever walking around with all that moon dust",6/3/1984 1:04
1371,1371, i've heard that hay fever from moon dust is harmful to people.,8/17/1970 13:07
1372,1372, I heard apollo 11 considered placing a UN flag on the moon instead of the US flag,6/10/1999 1:19
1372,1372," Hmm, that could have been a good thing.  It would have included the whole planet.  What do you think?",11/16/1971 14:20
1372,1372," I prefer the US flag, I mean everyone on Apollo 11 was from the US ",4/27/1987 20:02
1372,1067, True. It was definitely an American accomplishment.  I wonder what made them decide not to use the UN flag.,9/15/2016 19:20
1372,1372, I don't know. It's pretty interesting one of Saturn's moons may have methane based life,3/13/1970 17:21
1372,1067, That is interesting!  Is it Titan?  I think that's Saturn's most well known moon.,3/18/1982 7:15
1372,1067," Mars' mon Phobos is one third hollow, that's crazy",10/27/1996 8:32
1372,1372, That is crazy.  It's crazy that scientists can know that and it's crazy that a large partially hollow object is orbitting around in space.,12/15/2018 22:11
1372,1372," Yea that is pretty crazy, so is Bruce Lee winning the cha-cha championship in 1958",5/8/2013 19:27
1372,1372, Bruce Lee won a dance contest?,10/7/2006 4:26
1373,1373," Yep, and Tupac did ballet in high school too",2/17/1987 11:48
1373,1373," I can see Bruce lee dancing, but Tupac doing ballet?  That's amazing.",12/21/2002 9:43
1373,836," Yep, Tupac played the Mouse King in his high school production of The Nutcracker ",4/14/1972 21:16
1373,836, That is pretty cool.  Did you know that Michael Jackson has a patent on a device he used for some of his dance moves?,4/16/1980 13:27
1373,1373," Yea, they have videos on youtube showing how it works. Did you know the same piano was used to record Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude?",11/28/2009 15:46
1373,836, i honestly did not know that.  I wonder if Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney were friends.,8/7/1979 7:58
1373,1373, Bruce Lee was so talented. He even won the hong kong cha-cha championship back in 1958! Man of many talents.,7/28/2020 6:25
1373,1373, Bruce Lee was great! I loved his movies.  Michael Jackson was also talented.  He has patent on a device that he used in dancing.,4/13/2022 10:26
1373,1373, That's so amazing! Even Tupac danced ballet in high school. Would have never known that. ,7/4/2005 22:00
1373,1373, True.  Do you like cars?  What do you think of Tesla?,6/11/2005 17:26
1374,1374," Yes. Is it just me or is Tesla becoming a very popular car all of a sudden. Toyota owns 10% of Tesla, didn't know that ",1/30/1983 12:37
1374,1374, I didn't know that either.  Tesla is growing in popularity. I think it is because of Elon Musk.  ,10/8/1987 13:08
1374,1374, Elon took a 78$ million paycut in 2014 and returned it all but $1! How crazy,11/19/1974 11:18
1374,987, He is impressive. Did you know he founded Paypal?,12/14/1974 4:16
1374,1374, He did? I did not know that! He was smart man.,6/7/1984 4:43
1374,1374, He also founded spacex.  I wonder if he'll have space travel for everyone eventually.,11/25/1972 12:13
1374,1374, Wow! Who knew. Tesla model s runs linux. Fun fact!,11/7/1988 21:52
1374,1374, I certainly didn't.  I like that they are heavily into solar energy.,1/27/1992 13:39
1374,1374, They specialize in a lot that I didn't know about. Even powerpack batteries.,3/27/2009 16:01
1374,1374, I didn't know about solar roof tiles. I thought solar was just for the cars.,7/6/1992 16:17
1375,1375, You can use them for solar energy I think. Whats really interesting is that Fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined. I would think CNN would be popular.,9/10/1999 14:37
1375,1375, It is gaining in trust and popularity.  I had no idea that Richard Nixon had a hand in creating it.,1/3/2011 16:30
1375,61, That's neat. They broadcast in 86 countries!,4/13/1980 10:36
1375,61, I didn't know that either. Did you know they threatened to sue the Simpsons?,12/13/2002 9:05
1375,61, I didn't! Apparently they didn't like being parodied by them for anti-democractic party agenda. ,3/27/2008 19:50
1375,61," Seems odd to sue them though. I mean, the Simpsons is a show on Fox which owns Fox News.  It seems like Fox could have just stopped them.",11/16/1975 0:29
1375,1375, That's right. Especially since they have talked about creating a channel that would only air the Simpsons. It's like they want to keep them yet they dont want to associate with them.,1/13/1974 20:04
1375,1375, Odd.  Fox also has affiliations with the gaming website ign.,9/28/2010 14:19
1375,1375, Interesting!,2/9/2020 8:32
1375,61," hi, do you like dance?",1/20/1976 0:55
1376,943," I do, however I am not very good at it, which is what makes it half of the fun",6/21/1989 15:00
1376,943, I guess. Did you know tupac was a dancer?,9/17/2010 21:09
1376,1376, I didn't know that.  I do know that parrots do have the ability to dance in time to music.,6/1/1987 3:51
1376,943, That is cool. Yeah Tupac practiced ballet,4/12/1984 22:53
1376,1376," Wow, he was really a person of diverse talents.  I heard there was this one episode of Mr. Rogers where he learned to breakdance.  Id like to see that one.  It seems as out of place as Tupac and ballet",1/10/2018 15:55
1376,943, I know and it is a diffucult type of dance too. they go through 4 pairs of shoes A WEEK,5/2/1976 14:32
1376,943," I dont even go though that in a period of months, in terms of sneakers that is. That must get expensive",9/28/1980 22:23
1376,1376, Yeah I bet and they do not make that much money,1/27/1970 13:13
1376,943," Yeah, definitely not enough for a Tesla, have you seen those cars?  They are pretty neat.  ",10/5/1988 23:29
1376,1376," Yes they are, I hope to be able to afford one one day",2/1/1979 12:49
1377,1377," Supposedly Toyota owns 10% of tesla, that might be as close as I ever get.  ",12/20/1978 6:53
1377,1062, Oh wow did not know that. ANd tesla model s runs linux,2/13/1979 23:25
1377,1377," That is pretty cool.  I like when groups think outside the box, it is that kind of innovation that we need.  Teslas are supposedly so safe they broke the safety testing equipment",11/17/1981 19:36
1377,1062, that is cool and also model s is tested indoors becuase it does not produce emissions,12/15/2015 4:55
1377,1377," I didnt know that it was because it got tested indoors, but given how they run that does make sense.",6/23/2002 15:47
1377,1062, yeah. did you know elon also founded paypal?,4/23/2009 12:59
1377,1062," No.  Ive read his biography, but didn't remember that one.  He is a fascinating person.  If people complained about their wages, he would often try to do their job, and if he deemed that he could do it, or it could otherwise be absorbed, he would fire them.",7/11/1972 22:51
1377,1062," Wow, he can be eccentric sometimes. I guess that is why he has managed to be where he is",6/16/1995 13:12
1377,1062, They even release their patents to encourage competition.  ,7/17/1994 8:26
1377,1377, WOw. Nice chatting with you,5/23/1992 3:00
1378,381," Hello, How are you tonight? Have you seen the Tesla car?",9/26/1984 20:15
1378,1378," Yes I've actually driven in a Tesla before, what about you? I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days",3/8/2009 20:22
1378,381," Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews.",2/27/2008 20:58
1378,1378," Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL",6/9/1987 22:42
1378,381," Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014.",2/22/2006 8:24
1378,1378," Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha",2/23/1990 20:50
1378,381," Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up!",3/5/1985 11:31
1378,381," Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently",8/17/2021 8:49
1378,381," Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol",7/10/1976 0:38
1378,381," Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world",10/28/1979 11:22
1379,1379, About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators! ,6/10/2008 14:48
1379,1057," Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons?",7/7/2021 19:45
1379,1057, I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show?,4/21/2007 13:59
1379,1379," I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old",1/13/2016 19:28
1379,1379," Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe. I do believe Fox news is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.",9/5/2017 5:20
1379,1057," Yes I think you're right. It's also interesting that Fox News has only 55% of its time dedicated to opinion pieces while on MSNBC at 85% of the time, they definitely have a better percentage on Fox News in my opinion",2/6/2004 3:26
1379,1379," I think so.Do you like Dance? I love to watch babies dance to music, adorable!!",4/18/2003 5:43
1379,1379, Yes I agree with you! I also think it's funny that the girl from Game of Thrones did the robot dance and also the Funky Chicken during her audition LOL I wish I could see that tape,10/4/1987 8:10
1379,1379," Ha, ha, ha,I can imagine that! I'm not surprised MJ used a device for the lean dance move? Wasn't that in the song  Smooth Criminal?",1/4/1998 3:04
1379,1379, Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that he has a patent on that device. It's crazy though that the moonwalk was first performed in1955 so it's actually an old dance move,5/4/1989 6:19
1380,1380," Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then. Good chat!!",6/1/1990 20:18
1380,134," Thank you you too! And watch out next time you see a ballet dancer, apparently some ballet slippers can make drawings out of the performers movements on the floor",2/13/1997 13:11
1380,134," hi, do you enjoy reading?",1/15/1980 20:54
1380,1380," Yes, I like to read before I go to sleep. ",3/5/1999 3:27
1380,134," nice, me too. did you ever read the starship trooper?",1/7/2007 5:35
1380,134, I never read the star ship Trooper but I do like science fiction novels. It is not my first choice for a genera but I enjoy all fantasy. ,6/10/2017 14:25
1380,134," yeah , me either but is it in the reading list of three out of five us military branches",1/14/1970 12:37
1380,134, I don't think I would like a military recommended novel which would focus on battle strategies. I prefer Harry Potter.,12/14/1993 1:22
1380,134," nice, that is a good one. did you know the actor who play malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand?",5/16/1971 17:40
1380,1380, I would hope they would let him have the wand anyway. I would imagine those actors deserve the memorabilia. ,5/13/1992 16:42
1381,1381," i think so too. when daniel won the part of harry potter, do you know what his reward was?",5/7/1997 12:20
1381,1381, I think his parents let him watch Faulty Towers. I am only vaguely familiar with the TV show but I would imagine it is still a fun classic show in the UK.,10/17/2004 12:28
1381,1882, yeah and he must have been so happy to be able to do that,9/6/1992 13:42
1381,1882," Yes, I am sure he is very grateful for being able to be apart of the movies. The Lord of the Rings films came out during that time and I always though he would also make a great Frodo.",8/17/2020 13:23
1381,1882, ohh yeah that is true. do you know where hogwarts is located?,8/17/2002 19:56
1381,1882," Yes, Hogwarts is in Scotland.",6/26/2016 4:32
1381,1381," yeah, many people think it is in England actually",7/17/2011 7:45
1381,1381," I is a very English novel so I can imagine why people would think it was located there, not as English as Tolkien and CS Lewis novels. ",6/22/1997 17:02
1381,1381, true. the character of troll was actually named harry potter back in the day,12/14/1988 18:45
1381,1381, I think you are confusing the Lord of the Rings with the unauthorized harry potter sequel.,8/20/2018 3:06
1382,1382, maybe. do you read wikipedia much?,9/21/2018 18:08
1382,1672," Yes, I like to check on the background of artists but I worry it is not always accurate so I just use it for more common information.",6/15/2009 10:40
1382,1672," that is very true, it is relevant. nice chat",11/22/2015 0:09
1382,1382, hi how are you? do you like reading?,6/17/1995 19:45
1382,1382, I do like reading. I like the cognitive process of decoding the symbols to derive the meaning. ,2/7/2011 11:59
1382,1382, I like reading because it is a good way to learn and to focus the mind. ,9/8/1993 13:08
1382,1672, Do you know how to read in Braille?,6/15/1984 13:29
1382,1672, I never learned. i wonder if it is hard. i see it all over the place on signs and in elevators.,6/20/1992 3:47
1382,1672, I'd like to learn as well. It can't be too difficult.,1/26/2009 1:22
1382,1672, I know that it was invented by a french guy named braille.,2/17/2014 22:46
1383,1383, That's interesting. Did you know that in the 18th Century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?,7/25/1992 23:59
1383,1383, I know that poetry was the big thing back then. it was considered pure and good for morality. novels had all kinds of dirty themes.,9/15/2018 15:33
1383,1695, I guess they didn't want people to gain to much knowledge and perspective.,1/16/1988 12:55
1383,1695," Yeah, keeping books away from people usually doesnt work. they eventually get their hands on them.",7/21/1995 17:58
1383,1383, Did you know that Ender's Game was suggested reading material for the Marines?,8/28/2011 20:14
1383,1695, Enders Game has a lot of strategy and tactics in it. it is probably good for the troops.,8/6/2020 5:11
1383,1383," Yeah it does, it's also suggested reading for many other military organizations.",10/24/2007 10:17
1383,1695, I guess they like military-themed novels for the troops. it will give them a better mindset.,7/28/1984 10:49
1383,1695," It probably would, Starship Troopers is another one that's on the list for 3 of the 5 US Military Branches. ",11/25/2009 15:02
1383,1695," Heinlein was in the navy, so his books have a lot of war and military. i liked that book. the movie, too.",10/15/2010 3:19
1384,1384," I've actually never seen the movie nor read the book, and I was in the military. haha",4/3/1997 21:39
1384,1384," LOL. The book is pretty good, but i think boys prefer it. Anyway, great chat!",8/9/1970 13:44
1384,1384, Great chat! I hope you have a good day!,10/2/1990 22:39
1384,1237, You too! Have a good day!,12/17/1973 14:44
1384,1384, You too!,7/3/2008 13:02
1384,1384, Do you like sharks? ,6/12/1986 2:13
1384,1384," I think they're one of the most interesting animals on the planet plus I enjoy watching Shark Week, how about you?",5/18/1984 3:03
1384,1384," I rarely watch it. But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on? ",3/19/1971 6:58
1384,1384, It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air.,8/3/2017 8:20
1384,1237, I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors? ,6/6/1978 23:59
1385,871," I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator.",1/26/1971 1:27
1385,1385, It sort of sounds not real to me. ,8/1/2021 5:15
1385,871, Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well.,7/5/2000 13:57
1385,871, Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark? ,10/5/1990 10:30
1385,1385, I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about!,3/3/1974 22:11
1385,1385," Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs. ",5/24/1980 14:22
1385,871," That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better.",7/26/1981 10:58
1385,871," What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs? ",12/19/1970 8:59
1385,871," I am a big dog person, I have one of my own. I'm allergic to cats so they were never really an option for me.",6/23/2005 19:04
1385,871, I'm allergic to cat hair too!,11/9/2018 20:32
1386,1386, Do you have any pets of your own?,3/16/2020 11:18
1386,1386," Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats? ",2/8/2008 9:29
1386,28, I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed.,9/6/1972 21:20
1386,1386, This is true. By the way did you know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog can have? ,9/26/1977 2:25
1386,28, I did not know that. I do know that the dogs and cats than vets keep as office animals are often used for emergency blood donation.,3/11/1977 17:28
1386,28," That's pretty cool. I was unaware of that. Well, nice chatting!",11/21/1974 21:31
1386,28," It was nice chatting with you as well, have a great day!",11/28/1998 14:35
1386,1386, Good morning. How are you this morning?,10/13/2015 8:39
1386,1386, Good morning! I am good. Just checking out all the place to eat in Vegas.,5/16/2005 7:02
1386,1386, I bet there are some nice places out there.,1/5/2002 11:47
1387,199," Yes, some offer up immense 10 egg omelets and pancakes as big as hubcaps, most places on the strip.",4/7/2015 0:38
1387,1387, Thats awesome. So do you like fish at all?,8/3/2015 23:32
1387,199, I do. They are so unique. It's cool that saltwater fish drink through their moths.,12/25/2003 11:04
1387,199, It is cool. The black swallower fish can eat prey ten times its own weight and twice its own length.,8/27/1985 23:25
1387,199, That is incredible! The only fish without a neck is a seahorse.,9/25/1990 5:23
1387,199, I think the seahorse is the only fish with a neck. Lol. I heard about a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,6/16/1974 18:32
1387,199, Kind of males me wish to be a jellyfish! Zebra fish carry counterparts to human disease in 84% of their genes.,1/27/1996 14:22
1387,199, I bet we could use them to study diseases related to humans then.,2/23/1991 21:55
1387,199, I bet you're right. Freshwater fish drink through their skin via osmosis.,2/19/1994 21:48
1387,1387, That is really interesting. So what do you think about judge judy being the second highest paid celebrity behind lebron james?,3/20/2019 8:35
1388,1258, I have heard that she makes over $100k per episode. It seems over-the-top to me.,5/14/1980 10:35
1388,1388, Hey if she can make that much I dont blame her for taking it. Lol. I guess pixar has a special room that is secret for celebrities.,4/15/1977 11:46
1388,1388, That would be fun to see. Do you remember the show Sesame Street? The first celebrity to ever appear on SS was Carol Burnett. ,4/16/2000 16:19
1388,1258, I remember watching sesame street. I dont remember her being on it though. I guess I wsa pretty little though. ,8/13/1996 2:26
1388,1258," It's hard to believe she was the fist celeb. appearance. Speaking of firsts, The first celeb. to voice an animated film was Robin Williams.",11/25/2020 6:03
1388,1258, Yeah I think his role as the genie in alladin kind of started that trend. He was awesome in that role. ,6/30/1975 9:38
1388,1258, I agree. He was very talented. It was nice chatting with you today. Have a good day.,2/25/1980 18:12
1388,1258, You have a great day as well. Nice chat. Bye.,4/1/1974 22:27
1388,1258," Hello, how are you doing today?",4/30/2019 10:38
1388,1388, I am great! how are you? ,12/17/1986 18:27
1389,1389," I am good, have you ever been to Las Vegas?",9/12/2009 10:43
1389,1389, I have been to vegas. interesting place. ,10/29/1986 5:20
1389,149," It is, it has some of the craziest buffets I have ever seen, also its full of clebrity chef's",3/3/2015 22:25
1389,149," Yeah, the food is good. easy to put on the pounds. i dont like to gamble. it is boring. the shows can be good too.",1/8/2004 6:06
1389,149, Yea I have never been into losing money! Do they still have breakfast available at all hours there?,10/18/2005 13:18
1389,149," Yeah, probably, but i would avoid the cheap stuff. you could get sick. the high end is quite good. talk to the limo drivers. they can give you advice.",10/10/2008 0:59
1389,1389, That's how it is just about anywhere the people driving always know the best places to go!,4/2/2015 1:42
1389,149," Yes, always chat with the limo drivers. give them a $5 tip for their thoughts. you will have a better vegas experience.",12/20/1971 13:05
1389,149, Very true. Do you own any fish?,7/20/2000 14:17
1389,149," I do not. never have. they look pretty, but they are not very loving.",1/16/2001 16:37
1390,335," Thats very true, where I am currently in the Czech Republic we have these fish called Lamprey. They are pretty scary looking!",12/23/2006 19:30
1390,335, Are those fish with the huge jaws and razor sharp teeth? Not very cuddly.,1/8/1985 2:07
1390,335, Yea they look like big leeches with a row of teeth circling there entire mouth! They also only drink water through there skin!,6/7/2012 19:06
1390,1390, Hm. that is interesting! Fish seem interesting. There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. wouldnt that get boring though?,12/12/1994 17:49
1390,335, It would but what if the black swallower get ahold of you? ,9/3/2001 17:40
1390,335," Um, i guess i would eat my way out of its guts? I can be pretty determined and have quite an appetite. ",3/23/1976 9:43
1390,335, I never thought about that! Did you know 84% of genes known to be associated with human disease have counterparts in the zebrafish?,7/31/2004 5:37
1390,1390," I figure we could learn a heap from them zebrafish. Anyway, great chat!",12/15/2011 8:13
1390,335," Its been great chatting with you, have a great night!",4/23/2005 21:21
1390,335, Have a great weekend!,6/19/2019 15:13
1391,1281, Bye!,2/16/1998 5:45
1391,1391, Have you ever had pet fish?,10/16/1980 12:19
1391,1391, I think I had fish when I was little. They are interesting though. My daughter has a fish in her preschool classroom and loves it,10/19/2004 22:30
1391,1391, I guess fish is not actually a formal taxonomic group. There are so many types of fish. Did you know there is a type of jellyfish that is immortal?,7/14/1994 17:48
1391,1391," I did not before now. I find it interesting also that freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish drink through their mouth. Its odd that they are different.",3/20/1995 12:20
1391,1281," Right. I wonder how the freshwater fish prevents from drinking through its mouth. Seahorses are also odd creatures. They look weird, maybe because they are the only fish with a neck.",6/13/2001 11:18
1391,1281," I think all fish are weird. When I go out fishing with my husband I don't touch the fish. Yuck!! I have never heard of a black swallower fish, but it sounds creepy that it can eat prey twice its length and 10 times its weight. Where would it go?",12/30/2005 17:09
1391,1391," I guess it expands a lot! I don't like eating fish. I think they are kind of gross. I do like aquariums, though.",9/19/2003 16:08
1391,1281," I don't eat fish either. Aquariums are fun. It is so fun to see aquatic animals. Changing the subject... What do you think about the fact that Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode?",12/4/2007 12:32
1391,1391," That's quite a bit, but I find it hard to believe she is the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James. I thought some other actors made more than that. Maybe it's the number of episodes she makes.",5/22/1971 23:04
1392,1392," Well her television show is on every day. It isn't like a once a week thing. When you consider that, I am sure it equals out a lot. I am surprised to learn that Robin Williams was the first actor to perform in animated films.",2/2/2010 21:42
1392,734, Society loves our celebrities! So much that we have apparently needed to see them on Sesame Street. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear.,3/25/2019 20:06
1392,734, Society does love celebrities. It is interesting that we have this love/hate relationship with people we don't even know. Did you know that the most popular hat in the old west wasn't a cowboy hat? My mind is blown. It was a bowler.,5/9/1986 6:49
1392,734, That's very funny that we have come to associate cowboy hats with anything western.,3/31/1989 23:26
1392,1392," So I am from Michigan, and I know nothing about cowboys, or really the Western half of the US too much. Everything I know is basically what I've seen on television, and what little I learned about the expanion in School.",12/12/2008 18:32
1392,734," Yeah, I don't know much either except for what I hear from TV. Going back to hats, I find it funny that until 1998 British politicians had to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order in the house of commons.",1/20/2013 7:30
1392,734, I think that speaks to the generation. Hats used to be more formal. Tipping ones hat originates fro knights raising their face visors to show friendliness. Its funny how one tradition can lead to another.,4/24/2006 12:19
1392,734, Dunce caps are another funny one. They represented foolish behavior.,4/23/2011 22:13
1392,1392," Well foolish behavior always needs to be encouraged :) I find it interesting that in 1908 they had to pass a law regarding the limit of hatpins, out of fear they'd be used as weapons. A fashion statement that had to be controlled out of fear.",2/17/2000 19:20
1392,1392, I'll have to keep that in mind when deciding on a self defense weapon. Watch out for my hatpin!,4/7/2022 10:58
1393,555," Haha. Yes, it has a dual purpose for one to look good, and for two, don't mess with me, I've got a hatpin. Which back in the day that might actually be a legit concern.",3/24/2000 22:24
1393,1393," Yes, hats aren't so widely used anymore but they do still play a big role in society.",5/22/1983 7:47
1393,1393, Yes for sure. NIce speaking with you,9/11/2020 21:29
1393,1393," Hi, how are you?",1/27/1993 18:47
1393,1393, I'm great! How are you?,12/3/1980 14:24
1393,555, I am well. Have you ever been to Vegas?,5/17/1979 2:53
1393,1393, I've been once of twice. Have you been?,5/16/1981 22:04
1393,1393, I have. I usually only go to the cheap restaurants. My time is spent gambling and drinking. What do you enjoy there?,5/26/1989 6:06
1393,555, I usually try to catch some of the shows. There are some upscale restaurants too.,12/7/2000 17:19
1393,555, I have not been in a long time though. Ever sine my wife gave me culture. ,7/12/1972 4:16
1394,209," That's very kind and thoughtful of your wife to give you culture. When you have a chance, please remember to return it to her. Do you wear hats on occasion?",10/20/2004 9:01
1394,209, I try to give her as much grace as I can. We have 2 kids and I try to take them as much as I can so she can have some personal time. I do love hats.,6/15/1976 17:37
1394,209," Which would you prefer, a bowler or a cowboy hat? The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler, not the cowboy hat.",4/4/1987 23:16
1394,1394, Bowler! I find it to be so funny looking. I chuckle everytime I see it! What about you? What do you prefer?,11/27/1997 5:58
1394,209," I usually wear a baseball cap. I probably should wear a dunce cap, too. The origins of the conical party hat was derived from dunce caps, worn at parties to encourage foolish behavior",10/19/1997 4:37
1394,1394, You could wear it to british parliment if you were going to make a point...,3/12/2019 12:23
1394,209, Wearing a point to make a point of order. Are you interested in our friends beneath the water?,3/17/1980 22:47
1394,1394, I am. Are you?,12/31/2016 9:15
1394,1394," They are interesting, and can be quite tasty. There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Something about that seems unfair.",6/6/1998 23:11
1394,209, I think we should study that so we can live longer. I have a pension and could use another few years of wealth for my future generations!,6/22/1975 7:34
1395,19," But what will you do with your time? Immortality goes on for quite a while. Fish don't have to be entertained, but we do.",7/21/2018 15:19
1395,1395, Netflix! There's so many options there. Or I could work and grow my fortune even more! Like vampires do. Why do you think . they are so rich?,8/1/2021 12:50
1395,19, I thought they stole stuff from their victims and sold it on eBay. Hm. Netflix probably should do a better job catering to vampire viewership.,5/11/1984 20:08
1395,19, I DONT WANT TO STEAL! Just live a long time and get rich. Nice chatting with you!,12/2/2019 19:28
1395,1395, Did you enjoy the Harry Porrer series?,9/26/1994 4:35
1395,19, I only saw like the first 2. Did you?,8/14/1977 21:00
1395,1395," I watched them all yeah, and also the new movies, Fantastice Beasts and Where to Find Them",7/4/1981 22:08
1395,19," Oh ok, have you seen starship troopers?",1/21/2000 18:54
1395,19," Yeah that was a nice movie, I hear its also a good book",8/26/1994 23:12
1395,19," Well 3 out of 5 military branches are require to read it. I don't recall it being that good, but hey what do i know. ",3/17/1981 23:06
1396,1396," Enders Game is another book recommened for military organizations, havent read the book, the movie was alright",11/11/1976 1:55
1396,1396, This tells me that they are preparing for the children to run the country. ,7/10/2011 18:57
1396,1396," Who knows, books are a powerfull tool, in the 18th century they even caused a moral panic",7/2/2010 15:54
1396,1396, Really what about?,7/14/2012 9:11
1396,17," Because of the spread of novels, guess they werent prepared for them, its an odd thing though",5/24/1985 4:27
1396,1396," Yeah knowledge is power, some institution fear for it's communities. Do you speed read?",2/14/1973 7:36
1396,1396," I do, im pretty slow at it but I  try to read fast, what about you?",8/20/1995 12:41
1396,17," Unfortunately i didn't get that trait. If i'm not careful i could be 15 minutes in before i realize i have no ideal whats going on. lol. However i hear the record for speed reading is 4,700 words. ",8/3/2012 8:52
1396,17," 4,700 per minute? thats really fast, who holds the record?",4/24/1975 3:03
1396,17, A young lady by the name of Anne Jones. I think it's cool that it is a women. ,2/27/1988 20:10
1397,1397," It is cool, she must be really smart, do you like Cs Lewis or Tolkien?",8/30/2014 6:35
1397,1236, I'm not sure iv'e ever seen him. What does he do?,9/19/2019 17:22
1397,1397," they are both authors and used to have a competition concerning poetry, terrible poetry to be exact.",6/16/2022 5:58
1397,1236, Wow that sounds like it would be kind of funny. So im told that Hogwarts is located in Scotland not England in the HP universe.,12/5/2004 0:23
1397,1236," I always thought it was England, J.K Rowling is a great author. ",3/22/2012 21:20
1397,1397, Do you enjoy the Star Wars movies?,7/25/1997 22:28
1397,1236, I do. Do you,6/14/2006 12:16
1397,1397, I do. I'm not a super fan but I like them. Did you know that James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording the dialogue for Darth Vader?,1/2/1998 13:47
1397,1397, I thought it would have been so much more than 2.5 hours!,11/7/2001 6:20
1397,1397, I would have thought so too. And he was only paid $7.500!,6/26/2017 1:51
1398,315," Man. I know that was in 1977 but that's not a lot of money. I realize $7500 for 2.5 hours of work is good but, man that's really shocking. Like Marcia being the brains behind it!",2/28/2003 11:09
1398,1398, I had heard that as well. She was the reason for Obi Won's death and Leia's good luck kiss. ,9/16/1992 16:19
1398,1398," I did not like Obi's death. When I first saw that movie, I was like 7 and cried! I was so sad...",2/28/1997 5:28
1398,1398, Oh no. It is sad. Did you know that Star Wars has been dubbed in Navajo?,7/22/1975 6:02
1398,1398, I did not know that. That is cool. That makes it the first one!,6/17/2021 10:17
1398,315, Yes it is. Were you also aware that Fox thought Star Wars was going to be a flop?,10/8/2022 1:15
1398,1398, They really underestimated that one... They let hm keep the merchandising too!,9/16/1980 5:48
1398,315," Yes they did. It worked out for Lucas. He gave up $500,000 in order to keep the merchandising rights. He's a billionaire just because of that!",4/8/2004 22:34
1398,315, Man... Did you know spielberg played clarinet on the jaws soundtrack? Did they run out of money for musicians?,6/3/2008 22:10
1398,315, I did not. I didn't even know he could play the clarinet. Jaws has such memorable music too. I do know that the soundtrack for O Brother Where Art Thou is 8 times platinum. ,10/8/1981 7:51
1399,1399, Wow. I would have never thought that... I didn't even see that movie. Batman begins features tracks of different genus of bats.,3/31/1997 3:23
1399,1399, I did not know that either. It's very clever. Speaking of music do you like The Ramones?,7/8/1988 13:31
1399,1399, I do. Do you like them?,6/14/1997 22:51
1399,1399," I do. They toured almost nonstop for 20 years and performed 2,263 concerts!",7/10/2001 2:40
1399,1399, That's a long time! Like going to a Creed concert! ,8/8/1986 18:28
1399,1908, Not a fan of them. I heard they performed so poorly at a concert that some attendees sued them. ,11/26/2007 15:54
1399,1399, Did you read the article about the composer of the Star Wars movie The Last Jedi ?,1/9/1984 18:22
1399,1908," I did, I thought that it was so amazing that it was called the best movie score of all time. That's so fitting for one of the most popular sagas to ever exist!",7/30/2006 22:26
1399,1399," I've never actually seen a Star Wars movie from start to finish, so I don't actually know much other than the most famous songs. I didn't realize how much money they made either.",1/16/1984 15:59
1399,1399," I'm not surprised you knew some of the songs at least, for how long ago the films came out I hear children today even love the tunes like The Imperial March. You need to watch the films! How much did they make?",12/5/2001 22:20
1400,148," Apparently 8.5 billion dollars, which is pretty wild. Still not the most money made from a film series though, only 2nd place",5/27/1971 17:47
1400,148, I can't believe that Fox thought the films would flop! It's too bad for them that they didn't keep the licensing and merchandising rights because of their doubts and lost out on billions of dollars.,10/9/1972 0:02
1400,1400," I think that's pretty normal for Fox, didn't they do the same thing with Family Guy and probably many other series that people love?",1/27/2018 1:14
1400,1400," Yes, you're probably right! Still I'd have a really tough time getting over the loss of around 65 billion dollars for the whole star wars franchise. ",5/25/2012 2:39
1400,148, I just can't believe they haven't gone under after making such bad decisions. Especially knowing these franchises are loved by basically everyone it seems. ,9/25/2002 22:57
1400,1400," I know, but I think that's just how the entertainment industry seems to work. They are probably really rich.",8/21/2022 8:45
1400,1400," Yes, defintely they are rich, at least the people who own Fox. Also the people in the movie too, since James Earl Jones earned $7500 for 2.5 hours worth of recordings",6/15/2017 11:11
1400,148, I was actually thinking that that didn't sound like much money for such a huge role. I know that even George Lucas was supposed to be paid 500k alone just as a directing fee,8/3/1983 14:25
1400,1400, I would love to work for $3000/hr. Seems like you wouldn't need to get too many jobs in order to have a liveable salary,2/9/2021 7:03
1400,148," Meanwhile, entertainers in the music industry seem to work very hard- like Linkin Park performing 324 concerts in 2001 alone.",12/9/2007 11:17
1401,1401," That is a lot of concerts, wow. That's probably more working days than most people ever think about doing in a year",1/16/2005 20:23
1401,1401, Yeah and other famous bands like the Ramones toured non stop for twenty years straight,1/19/1990 8:28
1401,757," I guess if you're doing what you love it really doesn't seem like work. Sometimes you don't even need an audience to play live, like Pink Floyd did in 1972",9/2/1975 6:53
1401,1401, And not just without an audience but some musicians like the members of Creed will keep trying even after being sued by four unhappy concert goers. ,2/23/2022 5:45
1401,1401, I can't even imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the people there. It must have been very bad. That's got to be a sign that maybe you should find something else. ,11/5/1986 10:16
1401,1401," Yeah, and you don't necessarily have to give up music either, the guitarist of Radiohead Johnny Greenwood ended up becoming a succesful indie classical composer. ",5/6/2010 3:38
1401,757," I'd want to be the person who just names the titles of songs, like they did on the Batman Begins soundtrack where it was either a genus or family of bats",11/1/2000 22:01
1401,1401," Hi there, are you a fan of Star Wars?",3/14/1970 14:57
1401,757, Yes I am.  Been a fan since a kid!  George Lucas created a monster when he made the first Star Wars movie in 1977.,4/23/1976 23:25
1401,1401, And it also holds the Guiness World Record for the Most successful film merchandising franchise. That is mind blowing ,6/12/1981 23:45
1402,1485, I believe it!  In 2018 the franchise was estimated to be valued at 65 billion dollars!,2/22/1989 10:07
1402,1485, That is amazing. Did you know his wife made major changes to the film that led to her winning an Academy Award?,10/9/1982 15:39
1402,1485," I didn't know that.  She was in the right place at the right time. lol  When it was released, 20th Century Fox thought it was going to flop.  Boy were they wrong.",9/28/2017 11:15
1402,1485, Yup pretty wrong about that one. It ia also the first major film to be dubbed on Navajo. ,4/6/2022 19:30
1402,1485, That's interesting!  James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording Darth Vader's lines for the original movie.  Pretty fast worker.,4/11/2013 8:17
1402,1402, Yeah and he only made $7500 from it but I wonder if he got any royalties after,1/15/1970 18:06
1402,1485, Good question.  I'm sure he had to have made something.  The franchise made George Lucas a billionaire!,11/3/1994 20:32
1402,1485," He played it smart, he paid a little money to keep the licensing and merchandising rights to himself. $500 000 well spent",4/24/1971 21:29
1402,1485, No doubt!  Do you like going to concerts?,8/21/2004 9:31
1402,1402," I do actually, but only when I have time. DId you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?",1/24/1981 13:51
1403,1403," I didn't know that.  Wow.  That's a lot of concerts in one year.  The Ramones played non-stop over 20 years playing a total of 2,363 concerts.",1/20/2019 1:51
1403,1403," That just blows my mind, did they not get tired? Wow. I wonder if they played in the ancient theater in Croatia?",12/21/2021 0:07
1403,1403, They might have!  lol  Pink Floyd played at an ancient ,10/15/1983 22:13
1403,1403," Yeah they did but the theater was empty, no audience. Wonder how that idea came about",9/16/1982 8:10
1403,1064," You knew about it!  cool!  Sorry I hit the enter button by accident.  In 2002 the band Creed played a show that was so bad that 4 of the concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  They must have been really, really bad.",5/26/1993 18:27
1403,1064," No worries. Yeah, I am glad I have never had such an experience at a concert, at least so far. Speaking of music, did you know that Spielberg was the one to play the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack?",4/19/1994 14:49
1403,1403, I had no idea!  The soundtrack to O'Brother Where art Thou? is cerfified 8 times platinum!  Loved that movie and the music in it.,8/30/1992 17:50
1403,1064," Yeah that is true, they did a great job there. Nice chatting with you",12/3/1978 7:25
1403,1403, Do you know what the dodo bird looks like?,12/22/2020 2:11
1403,1403," No, I do not.  What does a dodo bird look like?",1/25/1975 11:06
1404,1404," lol, they say its from the pigeon family! I love birds and have watched them make nest.",6/19/1997 22:44
1404,1404," Apparently, hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.  Lazy birds!",3/16/1983 9:55
1404,1404," Ha, ha, ha, right! I wonder how many days it takes birds to fly without sleeping from Alaska to Mexico?",1/15/1988 18:47
1404,1404, I don't know. I wonder if at least they rest somewhere along the way.  That was an interesting fact.,3/25/1980 16:16
1404,1404, I would think they would have to! But they must not stay long or sleep and keep going. ,10/27/1973 1:46
1404,1404," Apparently, in most birds, bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers.",10/4/2004 13:34
1404,1404," I never thought about that the feathers would weight more, but it makes sense. African grey parrots as well some wild birds in Australia can mimic alot of different sounds and noises.",12/11/1995 1:27
1404,1595, Please tell me what types of sounds or noises they can mimic.,2/6/1990 17:21
1404,1595, lol I had an African grey that could say everything I said around the house. Like clean your room! as well any loud sounds.,8/4/2005 5:32
1404,1404, That's interesting.  I did not know that there were two types of birds that had no wing.  They are extinct though.,12/14/1972 4:56
1405,1229, That's interesting!  Were they called moa and elephant birds?,11/10/1995 13:02
1405,1229, Yes they were.  Do you have more uncommon facts about birds?  Have you seen bee hummingbird ?  They are only 2 inches in size.,3/3/1984 16:50
1405,1229, I have a hummingbird feeder and its interesting to watch them flutter their wings while eating. Are you interested in comedy films? Bill Murray was always funny!,10/15/2012 0:02
1405,1229, I like comedy films.  Do you like Bill Murray?  Which one is his best comedy film?,7/12/2015 1:11
1405,1405," He has a few, the first I can remember is Caddyshack. I never watched 3rd rock from the sun, Was it any good?",9/29/2017 23:56
1405,1229," I have not seen that one.  Are you familiar with a comedian, Demetri Martin?  Apparently, he was accepted into Harvard law but left out of boredom and decided to pursue a career in comedy.  ",5/11/1979 5:35
1405,1229," No, I'm not familiar but I bet he's really talented to leave Harvard Law. Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to do comedy too!",3/26/2011 15:07
1405,1229," Life is short.  I think you should pursue your dream, if you can.   I like Ryan Stiles.  ",7/22/1973 9:29
1405,1229, I agree with you on that! Live each day to the fullest!! Good chat!!,3/14/2004 10:09
1405,1405, It was nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day!,2/23/2005 18:11
1406,1406," hey there, do you like nature and animals?",10/18/1971 5:44
1406,1497, Why yes I most certainly do. Do you?,4/16/2009 7:03
1406,1497," Yes, I really like all animals and especially birds.",9/20/2009 16:34
1406,1406, Have you ever watched the Paddington 2?,2/10/1994 20:38
1406,1406, No I have not. is that a kid friendly movie?,10/30/2007 8:33
1406,1497, Yes it is about a lovable talking bear,11/20/1975 11:27
1406,1497, oh ok that is cool. do you like horror films?,11/15/2020 0:52
1406,1497, I do like horror films. Insidious was a good one I watched that focuses on a paranormal investigator and her sidekicks.,5/8/1975 22:38
1406,1497," I cannot bring myself to watch them really. I might when I need to go on a diet though, as you burn more calories",7/9/1984 2:03
1406,1406, My girlfriend also cannot watch them so I have not really seen many horror films the last 3 years.,8/19/1984 18:04
1407,1407, apparently if you watch a horror movie and then see abstract art you enjoy the art more,4/2/1982 10:45
1407,1407, Very fascinating fact. I would love to see Liam Neesen in the commuter movie.,10/11/2005 16:37
1407,1407, do you know what a waterphone is?,11/20/1986 23:03
1407,444," no I do not, what is it?",9/20/1995 6:08
1407,444, it is an instrument they use to make sounds in horror movies,9/8/2014 21:28
1407,1407, Did you know that crows are the most intelligent birds?,2/23/2004 8:04
1407,444, I had heard about it when I read that they drop hard shelled foods in the pavement where cars pass by so they can crack them with tires,3/28/2022 5:53
1407,444, Very fascinating that crows figured out how to do that!,3/26/1984 12:54
1407,444," yeah, very smart creatures. have you seen pictures of the dodo bird?",8/13/1995 22:45
1407,1407," I have not, that is a funny name for a bird.",11/8/1973 16:45
1408,1099, Unfortunately it is a bird that has been extinct and was in the family of pigeons,5/20/2012 13:20
1408,1099, Very sad for the dodo bird.,12/18/2020 5:36
1408,1408, i know and for many other species that have gone extinct over the time too,2/17/1994 19:45
1408,1099, Moa and elephant birds also are extinct.,3/17/1992 14:32
1408,1099, yeah too bad. birds are amazing though. nice chatting with you,6/28/2011 21:05
1408,1408," I did not know that the sun is actually white, did you?",1/3/2014 1:58
1408,1408," Yea, I heard the sun is perceived as yellow due to atmospheric scattering",7/23/2022 22:44
1408,1099," Yeah that amazes me. Kind of like a lighting bolt being hotter than the sun, wow!",5/22/1989 23:00
1408,1099, Well the surface of the Sun isn't the hottest part of the sun so I can see how a lightning bolt can be 5x hotter,11/2/2001 19:00
1408,1408," I wonder how much energy a lighting bolt could produce then since the sun can produce enough in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.",8/7/2000 21:28
1409,642," I don't know but the sun does have 330,000 times the mass of the earth",12/23/1988 16:45
1409,642," Good point, but it's only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy. ",8/29/1996 18:30
1409,1409, It's crazy that the sun is 99.86% the total mass of the solar system yet so small compared to other stars,2/29/1980 1:46
1409,1409, I know so much we have not discovered. Do you like animals? There are 20 quintillion individual animal on planet earth. ,10/16/1981 14:47
1409,642," Yea, it's insane that there are 1 million species of insects",6/2/1991 7:04
1409,642, did you ever hear that when a animal is domesticated that it develops a white patch on it's forehead? ,1/20/1987 4:03
1409,642," No, i think I'm gonna go see if their is white patch on my dog's forehead",9/30/2020 19:06
1409,1409, Right i never noticed that either. Do you like fiction? ,7/28/1993 12:36
1409,642, I like to read novels and short story fiction,7/9/2016 18:27
1409,642, Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction. Do you know what of?,9/14/2004 4:23
1410,1999, I heard Caesar wrote about Hercules and Oedipus as a kid,7/1/2007 7:22
1410,1999, That's right! Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest examples of a cyborg in fiction.,3/1/1996 6:23
1410,1999, I like reading Edgar Allen Poe but haven't heard of stories involving cyborgs,11/8/2003 11:26
1410,1999, Yeah and apparently Wiki ranks fictional character according to their powers and abilities. ,10/15/1997 4:11
1410,1999, Nice. Did you know George RR Martin dislikes fan fiction?,12/29/1990 15:33
1410,1999, I did because he said it infringed on copyrights and was a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Not sure if i agree with that.,3/25/2000 23:06
1410,1999, Well I have to go. See ya,6/6/2010 6:21
1410,1410," Hello, do you know a lot about the Solar System?",8/25/1989 15:47
1410,1999," Well, the center of our solar system is the sun, which provides the majority of energy to support life on Earth.",11/1/2009 15:52
1410,1999," True, and it is very important to the earth as a source of energy. Can't get by without that!",10/16/2013 11:38
1411,1411, The sun evidently produces a type of solar music that can be picked up by a radio station that can change solar activity into sound. That would be interesting to hear.,9/23/2005 11:07
1411,1375," Sure would. It also makes enough energy in 1 second to cover the needs of the whole planet for 500,000 years.",7/26/1991 18:41
1411,1375, It also provides life-giving support to over 7 million living animal species.,5/1/2008 23:18
1411,1375, Crazy! Did you know that it is actually white and only visible as being yellow because of atmospheric scattering?,2/8/1989 3:34
1411,1375, Our solar system has given a lot of opportunity for some great sci-fi movies,10/29/1982 23:15
1411,1411," Yeah, creepy though that the sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. That is a huge percentage.",12/8/2001 5:46
1411,1375, True. The earth is a little pin hole.,2/22/1994 19:14
1411,1375, Yeah it amounts to the sun being 109 times that of earth. What a monster!,10/14/1998 5:22
1411,1375, Did you know that sunset on Mars in blue?,9/2/1997 5:01
1411,1411, Really? Wonder if any animals live there like the 20 quintillion on earth.,10/3/2008 14:37
1412,1811, Don't think so. It's like a ball of fire rotating as a solid body. The equator rotates faster than the poles.,7/7/1988 14:40
1412,1412," Ok, guess not then. Hey, are you a reader? Like fiction?",12/12/2004 2:56
1412,1811, Yes. I love fiction. The term robotics was coined by Isaac Asimov in 1941. ,10/23/1980 0:09
1412,1811, So do I. I never heard of Asimov. Seems kinda early in the 1900s for such a modern word.,2/7/2000 2:19
1412,1811, 1941 actually. A new fiction novel coming out around 2020 election is centered on communicating from the afterlife. Do you like stuff like that?,2/26/1976 19:30
1412,1412, No not really a fan of that type of novels. I am more into Edgar Allen Poe. He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction.,9/14/1983 15:46
1412,1412," He was a great author, but I think he was a little strange. ",3/18/1988 10:25
1412,1811, Well that's probably true of lots of them..lol! Hey nice chatting with you. Have a great day!,9/24/1981 9:43
1412,1412, Hello. I love good weather all thanks to the sun! It is a perfect sphere of hot plasma! ,3/16/1976 17:03
1412,1412, Me too. I saw that the sun is actually really white.,8/28/2012 9:57
1413,1019, Yes you're correct but it only appears yellow because of atmospheric scattering.,7/7/1977 23:15
1413,1413, Very cool. Did you know a lightening bolt is actually 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun?,7/5/2002 8:53
1413,1019, I hope I never get struck by one! Surprisingly the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy.,4/29/1988 23:02
1413,1019, Me either lol. That's pretty small then in comparison to the other stars. I would have never imagined that.,1/11/1994 7:23
1413,1413, Yes me too. The sun is definitely the most important source of energy for life on earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system.,11/8/2019 17:11
1413,1019," Definitely. It produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of our planet for 500,000 years which is amazing.",7/15/1974 4:53
1413,1019," That is so cool. It makes sense though since the mass of the sun is about 330,000 times that of earth.",6/6/2018 21:16
1413,1019, For sure. Do you like animals?,7/22/1984 7:53
1413,1413," Yes I love animals. There have been around 1.5 million species described, so plenty for everyone to have a favorite!",7/26/1986 23:17
1413,1019, That's a lot of species. I saw there are 20 quintillion animals on Earth.,3/10/1991 16:11
1414,1345, That is amazing and I can't even fathom that much. The study of animals is called zoology and they must be busy with all those animals!,2/10/2019 18:11
1414,1345, For sure. Animals get white patches on their heads when they are domesticated.,6/22/1981 0:59
1414,1414, Oh maybe that explains why there are so many white patches on dogs. If you are annoyed when you get hiccups just remember they are a hold over from early evolution.,10/17/1998 6:51
1414,1414, Definitely. That's interesting about hiccups. That would have been so cool to have lungs and gills.,7/16/2001 12:56
1414,1345, Yes I would love to breathe underwater. The country of Scotland has a protection act against the Loch Ness monster. Do you think it exists?,1/29/2005 19:18
1414,1414, That would be awesome to breathe underwater. That's hilarious for something that might not even exist. ,7/26/1999 23:42
1414,1345, Yes I think so too. And this happened all in 1912! Well it was great chatting with you.,6/9/1975 11:53
1414,1345, Animals are pretty fascinating to study. It was good chatting with you too!,4/18/2019 22:17
1414,1414, Have a good one!,1/10/2021 10:59
1414,1414," Hello, how are you doing tonight?",1/2/2021 6:43
1415,787, Great. Are you into baseball?  Funny that MLB managers wear uniforms since they can actually play in the game.,8/13/1988 0:32
1415,787," Yea, I wonder how often that has ever happened though!",3/26/1988 19:23
1415,787, Maybe many years ago...  Baseball is really popular in Japan to the point that Japanese fans are surprised to learn that it's the US's national pastime. ,11/14/1984 14:34
1415,1415, I was just at a Japanese baseball game a few months ago! It was amazing.,7/16/1998 21:33
1415,1415," Wow, that's great.  Have you seen a kickball game in Canada?  I guess they call it soccer-baseball.",1/17/2015 15:21
1415,1415, They would name it that! Almost reminds me of that movie with the producers of South Park.,4/9/1985 18:51
1415,1415, Yeah.  Do you play golf? Babe Ruth was once the USA's most famous golfer.,10/29/1990 19:17
1415,787," I don't play golf, not many courses here in the Czech Republic! How about you?",5/20/2011 2:25
1415,787," When it's warm.  You're English is good. Are you a native Czech?  Golf courses use a lot of water.  An average course uses 312,000 gallons of water a day! (many liters)",4/18/2013 1:58
1415,1415, I grew up in Ohio for most of my childhood! That's alot of water. Did you know there is a golf course in dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day?,8/22/1989 7:28
1416,1416," I can believe that.  Speaking of Babe Ruth, he was caught stealing to end game 7 in the 1926 World Series.  His team was down one run.  Sad for the Bambino...",2/21/1974 20:18
1416,777, That is sad. Did you ever hear about Samuel L Jacksons golf clause?,7/29/1995 5:46
1416,777," Yeah, he gets to play 2 times a week.  No surprise, the women's World Cup got more TV viewers than the US World Series. ",1/12/1979 0:31
1416,777, I can only imagine why! Did you know Babe ruth actually got caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series when his team was only down by 1 run.,3/11/2020 6:46
1416,1416," Yes, I mentioned that above...  Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back World Series?",4/17/2009 16:48
1416,1416," You did, wow long night tonight! I did'nt know that!",6/20/1998 19:28
1416,777," Did you know about the MLB controversy over the composition of the ball.  I guess since it was changed, there have been a lot more homeruns.",12/15/1976 21:15
1416,1416," I hear some things about players thinking that the ball was rigged, but anyway its been nice talking to you, sorry for that brain lapse!",1/13/1979 20:25
1416,777," No problem.  Curious, how are Americans perceived in Czechoslovakia?   Trump? On the ball thing, I guess they did many studies on the ball's drag.  They had a lot of trouble nailing it down.  It remains something of a mystery.",3/1/2016 7:09
1416,1416," Czech Republic and Slovakia split up several years ago, we are 2 different places! As far as Americans go they are welcomed! Take care!",5/15/2009 3:04
1417,490," Thanks.  I have a good friend from Belgrade.  He says they like Trump there.  Clinton bombed them... Thank you, you were great!",7/5/1979 11:58
1417,1417, Have you heard about Idra Novey? Her second novel those who knew is apparently a very good book,9/9/1977 0:45
1417,490, No I have not. What is the book about?,3/19/2014 22:10
1417,490," Well it apparently deals with death, which is not very uplifting, but it involves a revolutionary figure apparently",8/29/1997 8:33
1417,490, It sounds interesting. I like fiction and also non fiction like scientific things about space or animals. Did you know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known cyborg in fiction.,4/15/1971 7:33
1417,490, No I didn't but that sounds really cool. I'd have to check that book out haha. What do you think about Julius Caesar writing fanfiction for Hercules by the way,10/17/1970 20:40
1417,490," I really like history, that is so interesting. Well I suppose George RR Martin would disagree, he despises fan fiction.",9/25/2012 6:19
1417,490, Yeah he does hate it. He considers that to be copyright infringement which is weird to me,10/19/2019 9:23
1417,1417, I agree. Did you know that the lochness monster is a protected species?,6/8/1972 20:49
1417,490," Yes I thought that was crazy, Scotland passed a animal protection act back in 1912 in order to protect the Loch Ness monster LOL I hope it's real by the way",5/31/2017 13:57
1418,1418," I know right. Another animal fact, in 2002 Germany was the first country to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights?",6/23/2009 15:18
1418,1371, Wow I didn't know that. I wonder what kind of Rights those include? Do you know? I also wonder why animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated,10/3/2011 15:48
1418,1418," I didn't know that, that is strange. Did you know that Hiccups are a holdover in early evolution when animals had both lungs and gills. So bizarre. ",11/10/2001 13:09
1418,1418, Wow that is very crazy. What is your favorite animal by the way? I know that I really like dogs,10/30/1997 0:14
1418,1418, I really like dogs also but overall I would say a tiger.,2/21/1982 16:58
1418,1418, A pet tiger would be awesome! Do you know anything about the Sun by the way? Apparently it's actually white and not yellow,12/30/1978 1:01
1418,1371," Yes that is because of the atmospheric scattering. The sun produces enough energy in one second for the entire earth for 500,000 years! ",6/18/2009 21:07
1418,1371," Wow that's crazy! We should try to harvest that, but it makes sense because the sun is 100 times the diameter of Earth actually",3/18/2020 3:31
1418,1371, The sun is only 1 billionth the size of the largest star that we have discovered in our galaxy,12/24/1989 18:11
1418,1371, That makes the Sun seem really small LOL what do you think about the fact that it takes Neptune almost an entire Century to rotate around the sun,9/11/2009 22:05
1419,916, Wow that is a long time. The Sun is 109 times larger than the Earth and accounts for almost 100% of the solar systems mass.,2/22/2006 20:27
1419,1419, Yeah that's very impressive! I don't think people appreciate that the sun is by far the most important source of energy for our life on Earth,5/20/1975 17:09
1419,916, do you like baseball?,8/12/1980 17:39
1419,1419, I do even though I prefer football.  Why did you ask?,7/5/1988 5:54
1419,916," I was wondering if it interest you,  I learned some fun facts recently. Baseball managers can technically play if needed. ",2/24/2001 13:06
1419,1419," In order for managers to play, they need to know how to play baseball though.  ",1/16/2006 0:52
1419,1419, I am pretty sure they know how to play baseball considering they are baseball managers...........,9/4/1995 11:19
1419,916," Are they physically fit though.  For instant, in a different sport, managers do not have to play.   the notre dame manager before the current one was very fat.  He knew how to manage the team but he could not play football in a million years.  What I'm asking is if the baseball managers need to be able to play baseball effectively.  Is this true that opposing team will receive three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?",10/14/1999 1:07
1419,1419," The fun fact is that they are able to play IF NEEDED. They dress up in uniform just in case,  baseball teams have like 20 players though hes probably not needed and hes probably not fit.  That wasnt the point though. ",2/8/1993 13:17
1419,1419," I see what you mean.  I'm not very familiar with baseball rules.  Apparently, the Chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back in the world series but they have not won since then.",5/8/1996 17:01
1420,1420, Thats interesting.  I hear in canada kick ball is called soccer-baseball lol ,10/23/1986 0:11
1420,1420," I did not know that.  160,000 balls are used for a typical major league baseball season.  It is such a waste and is not good for the environment ",10/31/1977 11:06
1420,1420, I recently found out that Japan like baseball and they didnt even know it was an american pastime lol ,2/8/1976 10:40
1420,1420, That was funny.  Another funny fact:  The Albuquerque minor league baseball team was named after the baseball team in the Simpsons!,1/23/1972 23:11
1420,1420, Oh thats awesome love the simpsons great show. ,5/5/1986 17:54
1420,1420," It is.  I like it too.  Apparently, the World Series was started in 1903.  I did not know that.",9/17/1983 1:07
1420,1420, Babe ruth was once americas most famous golfer lol ,6/26/2002 5:30
1420,1420, I did not know that.  I learn a lot while chatting with people.  I read an article that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the US.  That was strange.,2/3/1995 10:53
1420,1857, Thats cool.  I wish I had samuel l jackson schedule he gets to golf twice a week lol ,1/4/1982 15:07
1420,1420, I do knot know that Samuel Jackson is a golfer.  Kim Jong-ill of North Korea scored 11 holes-in-one in his first and only round of golf.,8/22/1983 7:44
1421,1421, Thats impressive.  he has time to golf?  ,4/28/1987 16:43
1421,1478," He is the boss.  He can do whatever he wants.  When you said about Samuel Jackson, is he the actor?",3/1/1976 7:17
1421,1421," Yeah pretty famous,  pulp fiction,  marvel avengers,  etc.  Its been great talking,  have a good one. ",7/8/1999 11:43
1421,1421," Hi Turker, did you know with 50 state in the union there are 100 US Senators?",5/31/1996 16:58
1421,1478," Yep I did know that. each state gets two senators actually. So you're right about that. I think it's interesting that the Senators used to be elected by the states, but obviously now they are elected by the people",7/19/1973 18:18
1421,1478," Yes that true,I wonder at times the what reason did the change took place. I may read upon that sometime.",8/11/1970 17:43
1421,1421," Yes I think it was from 1789 until 1913, but I am curious as to why they changed it, even though it makes a lot more sense to me. Did you hear about when Richard Nixon cracked the 165 year-old gavel by the way?",8/1/1974 2:29
1421,1478," No, I didn't know that. Did you know women weren't allowed to wear pants on the us senate floor until 1993, wow.",2/20/1993 15:19
1421,1478, No I didn't know that! That seems so backwards. And also kind of sad. Hopefully those women got to get into the Senate drawer with all the candy though LOL have you heard about that,10/21/1970 15:54
1421,1478," Yes, I wonder why so much candies, I was told back in the day was more a man control world, especially when it comes to women.",1/11/2003 9:51
1422,426, Yes that's the way it was unfortunately. I would love to get into that candy drawer right now though haha. I love Mars Bars and milky Way's and jelly beans lol. I'm actually really hungry just thinking about it,6/8/1986 7:13
1422,426," I was thinking the same thing earlier, hahaha are you familiar with the ex-basketball player Michael Jordan?",6/10/2019 19:09
1422,1422, Yes I've heard of him. I loved when he would play he was so good! Did you hear what he said when someone asked why he wasn't endorsing a Democratic candidate?,5/15/1972 16:42
1422,426," Yes, that was a little cold of him, because republicans brought his shoes too.",11/17/2004 18:25
1422,426," Yep, but I did like how he just stayed out of politics, I think too many celebrities get involved and it just messes everything up. Speaking of politics, do you ever watch Fox News?",5/24/2011 1:15
1422,426," I may have watched Fox News once or twice, not that I have anything against it, because I pretty much know what's true or false, but I like CBS,NBC or News 19.",11/7/1976 14:13
1422,426," Yep that's kind of what you have to keep in mind, is that most news is biased. I didn't know though that Fox News owned ign.com which is a video game website, I never would have figured that out",11/22/1982 12:57
1422,1422," wow I didn't either, don't you know fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined?",12/10/1984 20:17
1422,426, No I didn't know that. I wonder why that is? It's also scary that Fox News tried to sue The Simpsons when they were making fun of them too much.,12/22/1988 18:39
1422,426," Wow, fox news was created by republican media richard ailes and president richard nixon.",2/13/1991 10:05
1423,1423," That is really crazy. I didn't know that Richard Nixon was involved in Fox News. Also I was wondering, because the Simpsons is owned by Fox, if Fox News sued The Simpsons would they be suing themselves? How would that even work",5/31/1985 18:17
1423,1423," You are right unless fox didn't own the simpsons until after the lawsuit, I really don't know how that work.",9/11/2020 12:42
1423,1130, What do you know about clothes by the way? Did you know that the pilgrims did not actually wear those black clothes all the time?,12/2/1977 12:21
1423,1130," No, I didn't know that, I don't clothes shop that often. It was nice chatting with you.",8/13/1992 21:30
1423,1423," hi there, do you know much about US senate?",11/1/1989 14:59
1423,1130, I know a little.  What about you?,1/21/1986 6:30
1423,1423, I know they keep a drawer that is stuffed with candy there,8/30/1991 23:18
1423,1130," Yeah, I heard about that candy drawer.  Too funny.It's currently supplied with candy made in Pennsylvania.",2/19/1974 10:44
1423,1130," Yeah all the brands that I like too, Milky Way, Mars, and jellybeans",4/6/1992 7:49
1423,1130," Cool, those are some of my favorites, too. ",10/8/1973 1:54
1424,751, Yeah so tasty. Did you kmnow they had a gavel for 165 years before Nixon broke it,1/21/1999 17:39
1424,1424, Ha Ha.  He would have been the person to crack it.  I heard that women weren't allowed to wear pants until 1993.,2/14/2011 2:22
1424,751, Good thing those two senators stages a protest and now they get to wear whatever they like,7/10/2007 13:43
1424,751," That's so crazy, it took so long for that to happen.",5/30/1980 21:37
1424,751, yeah unfortunately. Do you have favorite clothes?,4/7/1983 23:15
1424,751," Not really, I wear mostly jeans and tshirts.",3/12/1998 4:07
1424,1424," Nice, do you like monocolor or colorful shirts?",11/16/2000 11:41
1424,751," I'm like the pilgrims, I like colorful clothing.  You know they only wore black for special occasions.",11/15/1982 0:58
1424,1424, That is pretty cool. Even apple had a clothing line,1/9/2010 22:40
1424,751," I didn't know that.  Have you ever been to the store in Alabama that sells only clothes, cameras, etc. found in unclaimed baggage at airports?",10/4/1995 14:34
1425,1425, I have not but now I would like to visit that. DO you know how fashinistas tell if clothes need to be tailored?,5/11/1984 0:30
1425,514," Yeah, they look for collar gaps on your clothes, I think.",8/19/2001 13:56
1425,514, Yesh that is it. Have you heard of the brand rip curl?,12/1/1987 16:51
1425,514," Yeah, they say they make their clothes in China, but actually they're made in North Korea.",4/19/2020 22:20
1425,514, Yeah that one. Nice chatting with you.,4/21/2014 13:25
1425,514," Good morning, do you listen to a lot of music?",2/4/1993 22:26
1425,1425," Yes.  I span many genre, but like classic country and classic rock the best.  I still have vinyl albums in the attic from my youth in the 70s and 80s.  And you? ",3/23/1979 2:37
1425,514, I listen to all sorts as well. I think rock is my favorite genre.,2/15/2006 1:39
1425,1425," Were you ever into the electric guitar instrumentals of the 50s and 60s, like the Ventures?",4/19/2012 13:47
1425,1425," I play a little guitar, not as good as any of those bands though.",12/18/2015 12:17
1426,653," I cannot play, but I do like good clean instrumentals.  About a year ago, Nokie Edwards, lead guitarist of the Ventures died.  Secret Agent Man is on of my favorite Venture's tunes.  I listen to the MP3 when I need a pick me up.",5/22/2012 22:16
1426,1426, I know the song but did not know who the band was behind it. I like that song as well.,11/3/1995 13:56
1426,1426," So, do you play acoustical or electric guitar?",6/9/2002 10:55
1426,653," I have an electric guitar, I never owned an acoustic one. I personally prefer the sound of the electric guitar more.",11/26/2012 1:39
1426,1426, Nokie started out playing a Fender Telecaster then switched to a Mosrite.  Fender is a prominent guitar maker.  I have not heard of Mosrite.  Have you?,11/30/1973 14:11
1426,653, No I have never heard of them either. I do own a Fender however.,5/17/2006 14:51
1426,1426, What I did not know is that Nokie played country with the likes of Buck Owens before starting the Ventures.  I wonder if ever played on Buck Owens TV show Hee Haw?,5/18/1980 6:37
1426,1426," I'm not sure, that show is a little bit before my time. I don't think I've ever seen it.",9/18/2004 3:22
1426,653, It is an old show...  You mentioned rock was your favorite genre.  What is your favorite rock album?,10/28/1994 3:39
1426,1426," I have lately been listening to more greatest hits albums to listen to some classic acts. Right now I am listening to a lot of Queen, David Bowie, and the Dire Straits.",11/28/1971 18:23
1427,1477," Mark Knopfler formerly with Dire Straits is my favorite living guitarist.  You should look up his solo works.  My favorite rock album is Pink Floyd The Wall,  Did you know that their album The Dark Side of the Moon was still a best selling album as of 2014, more than 40 years later?",11/24/1983 0:57
1427,1427, They are a band I would like to listen to more. I know a couple of their songs but they seem to have a diverse and interesting catalog.,9/22/2006 22:22
1427,1427," Have you ever listened to WhiteSnake?  I like some of their music, but the band does not have much stability.  They have had more that 50 members, so its hard to know who played which song, unless you refer to their Wikipedia page!",1/29/1981 16:05
1427,1427," I have listened to a song or two of theirs, I did not know they had that many members. That is a lot of turnover!",5/6/2002 20:40
1427,1427," True, and with that much turnover, their music style drifts based on the style and personality of current members.  Do you still purchase albums or do you stream music, like Spotify?",11/28/1999 8:07
1427,1477," I stream my music. I like the ability to be able to customize my playlists and separate songs how I would like them. It was fun talking music with you, have a great day!",7/7/1990 8:11
1427,1477," I stream too, but I also purchase to load on my old iPod to use when cycling.  Streaming on my cell on a 50-100 mile bike ride might leave me stranded with a dead cell and no way to call for help should I need it!  Take care... ",9/9/1989 15:11
1427,1477," That's a good point, I don't bike that far so I think I should be okay. You take care as well.",8/1/2003 2:36
1427,1427, Did you know Bruce Lee once won a Cha-Cha championship?,4/11/2002 2:05
1427,1477," No, is that true? that's pretty amazing but not completely surprising",10/5/1994 8:15
1428,1070," It is, he was really graceful as a martial artist, so I would believe it",5/1/2018 21:44
1428,1428," yes, that was my sentiment also, dancing can be much fun and relaxing as well as take one away from everyday troublesl",10/31/1970 16:44
1428,1428, I never have been a great dancer.  But I do martial arts.,8/16/1971 10:13
1428,1428," oh, that's very interesting, I never tried it myself. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer in his high school years?",10/6/2002 10:28
1428,1428, I think have heard something about him dabbling in dance.  So many people have such diverse talents that most dont realize.,8/8/1998 20:34
1428,1428," yes, I had heard about it recently and was quite surprised by it. I like a bit of wordplay myself, but would not consider myself a poet.",3/7/1989 12:44
1428,1428," Ive never been with words, but I do like poetry, especially inventive ones.  Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  Thats amazing.",2/11/1994 4:20
1428,1428," it sure is, people have used poetry for a long time, even in ancient times and all over the world.",5/28/1985 8:09
1428,1428, Even the Javanese alphabet when recited in order becomes a poem.,7/14/1973 18:50
1428,1070," I can imagine that would make it a lot easier to remember, I wish some other things were in poetic form, that might make them easier to recall.",3/3/2017 2:57
1429,1429," very true, people often dont get their pay for poems, Poe only got $9 for the Raven",9/27/1991 6:33
1429,1429," did you know that someone made a poem that is depressing when read normally, but becomes inspiring when read backwards? I wonder how much that person got paid.",9/1/1985 18:26
1429,1429, Ive seen one like that before.  That takes a lot of planning and creativity.,6/24/2002 12:13
1429,1806," omg yes, William Shakespeare was quite a poet, and a successful one at that.",8/14/1989 14:29
1429,1429, He really has changed society.  Some of the phrases he coined are still around today like wild goose chase.,4/12/2018 23:38
1429,1429," I know, and a lot of others too, makes me wonder, if they were in common use and he was the one that wrote them down, or actually invented them.",9/18/1975 18:38
1429,1806," Very true, maybe it was something people just said, there are plenty of phrases we use today that havent made their way into literature.",1/10/1980 20:54
1429,1806," and maybe some of them are better left out, but it would make for interesting material for future generations, maybe write it all down like Shakespeare and put it on stage.",8/7/1983 11:22
1429,1429," You never know, it could make you famous!",7/5/1977 5:00
1429,1806," hahaha yes, I doubt though as famous as good old Shakespeare, he even invented many names that are still popular to this day.",9/13/2005 13:01
1430,1509, He was a legend.  Its been great chatting but I must get going.,11/9/1976 20:47
1430,1509, Good evening!,12/18/1983 10:57
1430,1430, Hello. Do you use your computer often?,7/29/1980 12:11
1430,1509," During the week, yes - a lot.  On the weekend, not so much. Sometimes I feel like my entire life and mind are inside my computer...",3/24/2018 16:50
1430,1509," It is truly amazing how many things we can do on the computer, despite it simply being a device to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations. Those 1s and 0s sure go a long way.",8/14/2013 5:54
1430,1509, Binary rules!  It is amazing and remarkable how far technology has come in the last few decades - leaps and bounds!  The space shuttle's GP computer ran off of 1MB of RAM....,5/11/2011 10:05
1430,1430, I mean its amazing how computers can be made of anything from basic minecraft building blocks to running on water,7/17/1983 13:14
1430,1509," You mean computers that are powered by hydroelectricity?  When I fist read your message, I thought it said computers made out of water - which would be very strange!",2/13/1976 8:51
1430,1509, Oh lol. I should have been more clear but yes that it runs on hydro power. Do you think we will one day be able to upload our minds into computers like transhumanists think?,3/14/2012 16:46
1430,1509," I think we will but not in the literal sense like in the Matrix - but to a large extent, we have already made storing the majority of our lives in the cloud",4/17/1986 13:55
1431,1431, Wow that is an amazing way to think of things. What do you do online?,8/5/2003 14:40
1431,482," For work I do a lot of research and confirmation of transactions, also look for data I can use to support my theories and valuations.  You?",11/13/2014 12:47
1431,1431," Lol, I look at cat videos all day. Of course I do my share of work on my computer as well, but I also enjoy relaxing sometimes",7/17/2009 21:19
1431,482," Yes!  The cats, the videos, the cat videos to pass the time away!  I sometimes get lost on Reddit looking at Memes and some of them also include cats...",5/23/1995 11:00
1431,482," My favorite cat memes are the ones where they defy gravity and have no legs. Surprisingly despite dogs being man's best friend, there are more pet cats than dogs",5/20/2015 4:25
1431,1431," I would love to see the metrics on that stat about cats v. dogs - my main question revolves around the fact that if cats could talk, they would dispute being a pet and think that the human is their pet!",1/8/1995 13:45
1431,482," Well thinking that way are we really the pets and our pets the master? After all, we provide them with shelter, luxurious food, and they pretty much don't even have to work for anything much less like us. Hmm going into some very dark territory.",7/3/2017 14:41
1431,1431," Luxurious food for sure - our dogs eat so well it's criminal!  But they do walk me, make me take them out to relive themselves, make me pick up after them....",8/24/1970 12:50
1431,1431," Hmm maybe we are on to something? I see why cats were initially valued to control pests in some cultures and gods in others, but man they can laze about as much as they want. A cat that is 15 years old has spent 10 years sleeping! ",2/2/1995 6:59
1431,1431," That sleeping metric is something I can get behind!  If we were the pets, I suppose I would be sleeping a lot more!",5/14/2019 16:40
1432,1432," Did you know cats can even become elected officials? In talkeetna, alaska, a cat has been mayor since 1997",4/12/2019 9:02
1432,341," Ha!  Now we're going back to who rules the roost - Although, the cat can't possibly be worst than a human politician in that position",1/25/1989 14:42
1432,1432," Indeed. In any case, I really enjoyed this chat. I hope we aren't taken out for discovering the conspiracy of pets being the true masters.",6/11/1986 18:23
1432,1432, Did you ever hear of Nokie Edwards of the Ventures?  He helped create hits in the 60's?,9/10/1983 22:34
1432,341, I have not ever heard of him. What type of music did he/they play?,6/12/2021 4:06
1432,341, Looks like he did surf-rock standard,4/4/1971 1:09
1432,341, Rock music is good.  Even though I've heard that termites will eat wood two times faster when listening to it!,8/14/2014 19:37
1432,1432, Who comes up with that fact?  Do you enjoy Van Halen?  He recorded the guitar solo for beat it!,9/9/2006 9:38
1432,341,  I do like Van Halen and I didn't know that.  Did you know that Aerosmith made more money from the guitar hero game than from any album they did?,7/15/2008 13:35
1432,341, I know that game is very popular.  Pink Floyd guitarist made a houseboat on the river thames into a recording studio.  I'd like to be on that boat,9/29/1980 6:12
1433,1433, That would be cool.  Guitars are wonderful inventions. The les paul gibson made in 1949 has never gone out of production!,6/17/1984 13:26
1433,1598, Queen's guitarist must have been brilliant with a phd in astrophysics.  ,5/10/1990 23:46
1433,1598, Seriously! that's impressive!  Brian May of Queen built his guitar himself from parts from an old fireplace.,5/6/2019 18:09
1433,1598, I guess he really is a genius and creative too.  Did you ever the dark side of the moon?  It's been a best seller for 40 years.,4/22/2010 5:04
1433,1598, I can't remember if I have or not to be honest. Have you ever heard Legend by Bob Marley?  It's been on the charts for over 900 weeks!,3/25/2007 0:36
1433,1433, I don't know.  Maybe.  If you want to hear something interesting then you can listen to two 100 year old twin rappers from Japan.,4/5/1976 15:37
1433,1598," i bet that is interesting!  Say, did you know that Ohio is the only state with an official rock song?",10/3/1995 7:08
1433,1598, I didn't know that. Who created their rock song?,12/29/1975 5:03
1433,1433, I don't know but I do know the name is Hang on Sloopy.,4/15/1986 9:44
1433,1433, Matt Bellamy holds the guinness record for most guitars smashed.  I would have rather seen them go to charity though.,2/23/1977 3:48
1434,1434, I would have too.  Rockers can be strange.  Led Zeppelin didn't put a title on their 4th album.  They just wanted to confuse the press.,7/23/1971 2:19
1434,1434, That would make it hard to find wouldn't it?   Do you know the band Linkin park?  They had the best selling album in the 21st century.,3/17/1991 0:28
1434,1434, I do know them and like them.  That is impressive! I had no idea it was that popular!,7/12/1970 22:23
1434,1434, Whitesnake gave some opportunities to people with over 50 members in their band throughout history.  Better odds for someone to be in their band.,2/14/1994 23:56
1434,1434, Reality show is a good description for Bezos's search for a new headquarters location. LOL.,5/14/1976 8:56
1434,1136," The Amazon guy? Yeah, reality show sounds about right based on the jokes I read on Twitter!",4/25/1981 0:22
1434,1136," I can't believe all those cities were competing to see who could give him the biggest corporate welfare deals, just so he could fill most of those new jobs with people brought in from outside -- and probably drive up rents more than enough to make up for any new revenue.",2/21/1980 21:23
1434,1136," Oh yeah. The whole thing is a mess. It's the largest internet retailer in the world by revenue and market capitalization, so I guess I understand the desire for cities to want to get a piece of the action.",11/5/2022 15:55
1434,1136," Yeah, I live in Arkansas and see a lot of that approach of scheming to lure in outside business -- instead of encouraging the growth of more local business right here. It always costs more up-front in new taxes and infrastructure spending than we get in revenue.",12/7/2006 11:56
1434,1434," Ah, Arkansas, home of Walmart, the prior most valuable retailer in the United States until surpassed by Amazon in 2015!",5/10/1978 12:16
1435,1435," Yeah, Walmart HQ is about 50 miles from where I live, and they basically own the local governments. They just let us live here.",7/5/2009 11:44
1435,1435, I can see that. Walmart is the largest employer in the United States. That's quite a lot of power!,2/18/2018 23:20
1435,1435," Yeah, when I was a little kid there were only a handful of stores, all in NW Arkansas. I think the one in my hometown was the third one built.",1/24/2006 17:00
1435,638," Well, Amazon is gunning for them in all aspects, that's for sure. Who would have guessed that a simple online bookstore would diversify so much. They sell and stream everything now!",6/4/2002 23:32
1435,638," Yeah, and they own Whole Foods too.",9/27/1984 0:34
1435,1435," And since 1998 they've owned IMDB.com. They really have their hands in a lot of buckets, don't they?",5/9/2013 15:05
1435,638, Yep. And unfortunately they're setting the pace for how labor is treated. The conditions in their warehouses will probably be copied in a lot of other service industries if somebody doesn't do something.,8/9/1991 19:23
1435,1435, Yeah. I've heard Amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day as part of their daily shift! ,3/29/1975 16:34
1435,1435," That's horrendous. I did a lot of walking as a hospital orderly, but it wasn't that much. They even wear diapers or pee in bottles because they can't get bathroom breaks.",9/20/2000 2:20
1435,638, That just makes me so angry! I have to pet my cat to calm down! Do you like cats?,10/15/1973 5:57
1436,1436," I do! My mom fed a pregnant cat and encouraged a feral colony to grow up in her back yard, and I inherited responsibility for them and had to move them to where I live now when she died. But they're a lot of fun.",4/28/2007 15:36
1436,12," Cats are the second most popular bet in the US, after freshwater fish. I would have just assumed cats were first! Everyone loves cats, right?",7/15/1974 14:28
1436,1436," There are people who say they don't like them, or who prefer dogs, but it's hard for me to understand.",8/14/2019 10:07
1436,1436," In Japan and Taiwan they even have cat cafes, where people pay hourly to have drinks and play with cats! ",10/8/1975 22:40
1436,12, Sounds kind of like a dog park. I bet it would be fun. Nice chatting!,8/2/2016 15:58
1436,12, I'll have to plan a trip to Japan to check one out! Good bye!,6/19/2009 22:28
1436,1436, Bye!,1/17/2000 19:46
1436,1436, Hi do you shop online much?,12/1/1981 16:47
1436,1436," I do actually I do a lot of shopping on Amazon, and you?",11/1/2001 3:28
1436,1436, Me too. Do you ever use AmazonBasics products?,5/30/2007 15:13
1437,596, I do and I find they to be of good quality despite the fact they are not believed to be so,3/24/1992 16:22
1437,596, Yeah I think so too. Did you know Jeff built a clock in a mountain?,10/9/1980 13:20
1437,596, Yeah heard about that and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years,1/28/1991 4:26
1437,596, Yeah wonder what that is about Did you know Amazon own IMDB?,1/25/1998 19:37
1437,1437, Yeah they have owned it since 1998. They are everywhere it seems,12/19/1981 21:05
1437,1437, Yeah. And they now deliver on Sundays because of a contract with USPS,2/27/2009 18:08
1437,596, That is convenient for sure. Their workers seem to work up to 15 miles a day,9/23/2012 11:36
1437,596, That makes sense since they are so busy all the time but that is a lot of steps,9/9/1998 23:47
1437,1437, Yeah for sure. Do you know who their first customer was?,4/6/1979 17:24
1437,596, Yeah it was this guy who spent less than $30 and got a building named after him.,3/23/1997 17:50
1438,1438, Yeah that is awesome. do you use your computer much?,11/27/2022 14:05
1438,1214, I do all the time actually. Mine runs on a bigger ram than the space shuttle one,8/3/2013 19:58
1438,1214," Haha true story, 1 mb of ram is nothing nowadays. Russians once made a computer that ran on water",5/22/2001 21:39
1438,1214, That us pretty amazing. Do you have an Apple of a PC?,10/4/1996 14:10
1438,1214, I have an Apple and I hear that you are not allowed to smoke near that as it voids the warranty. Glad I do not smoke,12/12/1987 6:03
1438,1214, Yeah good for you. Transhumanists are trying to upload their minds to the computer,7/28/1988 3:29
1438,1214, Wow I wonder if they will manage to do that eventually. Do you like animals?,1/27/1972 15:11
1438,1214," I do, I have a dog and two cats. And you?",11/13/1998 18:25
1438,1438, William Shakespeare was a master writer; I would argue that the world will never see another like him.,12/14/2012 2:01
1438,1438," I agree with you.  I heard he might have actually been a woman, or,  a group of people.  Did you know he is credited with inventing the names Miranda, Jessica and Olivia?",10/6/1997 6:49
1439,1439, Yeah I actually did know that. He was a very interesting character. He kept his life very private. ,11/25/1974 18:56
1439,1439, Are you a fan of artistic dance like ballet as well as Shakespeare?,9/14/2018 22:41
1439,1439," I am not really a fan of artistic dance. However, did you know that Tupac danced ballet in highschool? Dance is such a undiscovered art.",12/31/2013 10:58
1439,228," No, I didn't know that about Tupac but I know football players talk ballet to learn to be more flexible and nimble.",12/9/2012 22:06
1439,228," Huh, that is pretty interesting. I have never heard that about footballers before. Michael Jackson even had a patent on a device that helped him lean that one time.  ",4/8/2018 9:58
1439,228, How about poetry?  Are you a poetry lover since you like Shakespeare?,4/10/1988 12:19
1439,228," Not really a poetry fan, but I do appreciate Shakespeare's work. Poetry is an interesting work of art though, so much effort and thought is needed to create such a small amount of work.",9/17/1974 1:10
1439,228, I read there is a poem which if read normally is depressing but when read backwards is inspiring.  I'd love to know the title or who wrote it.  Do you know?,11/17/2004 5:15
1439,1439," I have heard about this poem before, but I could not tell you the name of said poem.",2/9/2000 18:37
1439,228," I don't think most poets make a living at it even today.  Edgar Allen Poe got $9 for The Raven, which is probably like, what, $500 today?",4/19/1981 13:25
1440,445, Yeah I believe so. Poets back in the day where starving artists. ,3/11/1979 19:14
1440,445, I think they still are starving for the most part!  Did you know the Javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem?,9/3/1995 23:29
1440,1440," Why yes I did! Poetry dates back such a long time. It started in Africa by the Nile, Niger and Volta river valley. ",5/25/2016 8:41
1440,1440, I didn't know that!  Do you think rap is our modern poetry?,4/1/1984 9:43
1440,1440," Wow, I did not know that. That does sound about right though. Did you know that ancient Grecians concentrated on the features of poetry such as repetition and uses of speech. ",8/1/1973 15:08
1440,445," Yes, they tried to distinguish it from more objectively informative and  prosaic forms of writing.",4/19/2018 7:09
1440,1440," Yeah, exactly. I would argue that ancient people were much more driven and intellectual than modern civilization.  ",10/22/2017 16:51
1440,1440, They had less distractions and fewer forms of entertainment.  The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in Sumerian and is the earliest Western Asian poetry.,4/23/1970 16:20
1440,445," Yeah. Epics are interesting forms of work. So much writing for such limited meaning. But, its all about how much you love your work.",2/4/1999 15:02
1440,1440," Or, how much you have to say!  Great chatting with you.",5/18/2004 1:58
1441,264, Hi. Do you like Shakespeare?,11/23/1970 15:53
1441,1441, Hello!  Yes I do.  He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language.  Are you a fan?,4/2/1992 16:08
1441,264, I find him to be like poetry...it takes a while to get. I saw Macbeth at the Folger Theatre and enjoyed it.,10/9/2012 8:23
1441,264, How neat!  He coined a lot of popular phrases we still use today such as good riddance laughing stock etc.,12/20/2019 12:25
1441,1441, Really? I hear he invented the name Miranda. Who knew he influenced Sex and the City.,3/28/2017 11:56
1441,264, Wow.  I didn't know that!  Did you know that he was alive at the same time as Pocahontas?,12/22/2019 8:35
1441,264, Wow. Too bad they didn't meet. I'd like to see Pocahontas play Lady MacBeth...though I don't think they allowed women onstage back then.,8/29/1993 11:24
1441,264, I'm not sure.  Ironically both of them died only a year apart!  Do you like dancing?,4/9/1991 1:44
1441,264, I like slow dancing with my gf. I can't do Michael Jackson-like extreme moves.,3/17/1989 17:13
1441,1441, lol Me neither.  Did you know that he had a patent on a device that he used to get those extreme leans in some of his moves?,3/15/2008 6:07
1442,1442," He was good with $$, not unlike Tupac...who did ballet.",10/18/1985 20:29
1442,1442, I didn't know he did ballet.  Bruce Lee was a great dancer and won a Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958!,3/23/2004 21:27
1442,1442," Apparently, dancer can kick some ass. Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. ",8/28/1991 4:41
1442,7, lol  Profesional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  I wonder if Tupac wore those?  lol,6/23/2011 6:49
1442,7, Probably. He was mouse king in the Nutcracker. He could break some balls,6/16/1980 12:57
1442,7," LOL  On a different subject, did you know that Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of his poem The Raven?  ",6/14/2000 11:15
1442,1442, Wow. He should've moondanced instead. Or at least write a poem going backwards.,8/10/1979 0:20
1442,7, haha  There is a poem that if you read in normally is depressing but if you read it backwards it's inspiring!  That had to be tought to write.,11/17/2014 7:28
1442,7, Sounds like something the Beatles would do. Michael Jackson owns those rights too. ,5/15/2016 13:49
1442,1442, Yes he was smart to buy those rights!  Have you ever heard of the Javanese alphabet?  I've never heard of it.  When recited in order it forms a poem.,4/2/1989 17:19
1443,1443, I'm going to check it out now. Take care!,7/8/2007 21:55
1443,1028," Hi, have you listened to any good albums lately?",3/20/2004 5:10
1443,1028, I have to say that I have not unfortunately.  I haven't even listened to anything on vinyl.  Have you?,11/2/2016 20:17
1443,1028, I really love the new James Blake album. And last year's Janelle Monae's album was so fun. What do you like to listen to?,11/10/1986 18:39
1443,1443, I'm more old school. I like music from the 1980s and some jazz from the 1940's and 50's.  I'd love to listen to some music that was recorded  and made into bound books before 1948.,5/5/1984 20:49
1443,1443, That really is old school! Do you have any recommendations?,6/22/1975 20:52
1443,1443, I don't have any from the 40's and 50's but I would say Duran Duran if you like pop and Alabama if you like country.  If you like rock music then Bon Jovi and Def Leppard.  I do listen to a little Linkin Park. I was surprised to learn that their album was the best selling of this century.,12/27/1977 4:49
1443,1028," I was surprised at that too, but I remember buying the album when it came out. They were kind of the first band to cross rock and hip-hop/rap, in my opinion. I remember that collaboration with Jay-Z was pretty novel at the time",5/18/2019 5:01
1443,1028," I only know a few of their songs. I think they did one for the Transformer's movie that was really good.  Say, did you know that states can have official rock songs?  Oklahoma has one.",6/2/2008 2:21
1443,1028," I had no idea states had official rock songs, but Do You Realize is great. The lead singer is great with the guitar. Do you know how to play the guitar or any instruments?",2/24/1991 7:07
1444,1444, No I don't but I wish i did. I would love to play the piano. Do you play any?  ,10/4/2008 17:13
1444,1814," I played the flute and am taking piano lessons now. I've tried to play the guitar, but it was hard for me. ",5/3/2010 20:14
1444,1444, I tried to but I have to admit that it hurt my fingers just way to much!  Have you ever listened to Whitesnake?  I like a few of their songs and had no idea until recently that they had had over 50 different band members throughout the years.,10/5/2017 2:25
1444,1814, I'm only familiar with the popular songs they released. 50 members is a lot! Did you know that a Hanson song became a most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because djs didn't reveal the band?,9/9/1990 3:37
1444,1814, I did not know that!  I'm not sure what to say to that to be honest. I guess the song was really good if it got played on the radio station.,9/22/2005 19:07
1444,1444," It makes me think about how bands can transcend different genres of music. I feel rock music has that ability, mainly because of the guitar. It fits so well in different genres",10/22/1991 13:42
1444,1444, They mostly use an electric guitar so it can be used different ways.  What's interesting to me is that originally rock music drew heavily on the blues and even country music.,12/13/2020 10:00
1444,1444, That is interesting. It's surprising to hear rock's 50s and 60s influence still today. The Beatles are still influential in most rock bands today,3/16/1980 12:52
1444,1444," Yeah they are.  To me, good music never goes out of style.  I do like though that rock music is becoming more diverse and not just having a standard pattern.",10/16/2022 0:56
1444,1444," I agree. Even within pop music, rock music has an influence. Lady Gaga's Born This Way album was way less pop and more rock. It was kind of surprising, but she's always had a rock influence underneath.",3/29/1996 20:14
1445,1784," I like that album.  In a way, rock musicians have always been more :real and down to earth than pop stars.  I mean, take russia's biggest rock star. He kept his job in a boiler room while being a superstar.  ",12/30/2019 13:14
1445,1445," Despite the fame, he kept it humble. That's a true rock star.",2/18/1998 23:14
1445,1784, It really is.  I was surprised to learn that Russia had rock stars to be honest though.,4/3/1975 0:39
1445,1784, Good morning to you. Do you like rock music?It sure was popular in the 1950s when it first began.,3/28/1987 0:46
1445,1784," I do like rock music! Have you heard about the rocker, viktor tsoi?",4/9/1979 2:48
1445,1784, Yes apparently he kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rockstar in Russian history. What a humble guy.,4/3/1979 2:56
1445,1445, I know! I really enjoy stories about famous perfromers remaining humble and to their roots. ,6/16/2014 0:39
1445,1445, Yes very cool. Did you know the state rock song of Oklahoma is do you realize by the flaming lips? I didn't even know states had rock songs.,10/2/1986 2:43
1445,1445, I never knew states had rock songs either! I wonder if every state has one?,11/29/1973 13:38
1445,1445, Good question I'm not sure. Sonic the hedgehog was originally supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna.,5/2/1977 20:07
1446,418, I used to play the sonic video games and I never knew that!,9/4/2016 1:52
1446,418, Yes I loved that game. Do you listen to albums much anymore? Lincoln Park's hybrid theory album is the best selling album of the 21st Century.,1/26/1994 16:53
1446,1446, I am shocked that they have the best selling album. ,9/19/1992 17:28
1446,1446, Yes me too. I think it is also shocking that the dark side of the Moon is one of the best selling albums of 2014.,12/26/1977 5:08
1446,418, And it was released over 40 years ago!,6/30/2000 4:40
1446,1446, Yes that is incredible. Another funny stat is that two identical twins from Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old in 1992.,11/28/1971 10:51
1446,1446, I would love to see that!,7/4/1986 8:03
1446,418, Me too! The first album to reach platinum status without the support of airplay or major tour was NWA's straight out of Compton.,1/25/2004 11:54
1446,1446, I wonder why they did not have support?,5/5/1985 1:26
1446,1446, Maybe he wanted to prove a point. Or maybe rappers didn't get much respect. I betThe album came out on audio cassette! ,8/7/2021 5:27
1447,1406, Do you like reel big fish?,12/19/2015 4:08
1447,1406, Yes they're pretty good. They rerecorded all their hits from best of album after losing their rights to their old record label...that's kind of funny. Well it was great chatting with you today.,9/14/1983 9:23
1447,1447, I wonder why they lost their rights. It was nice talking to you too. ,8/23/2006 23:41
1447,1447, Probably something in the fine print. Have a good one!,10/10/2015 7:53
1447,1406," HI, have you read Macbeth? I read it and is very interesting",12/29/1979 13:19
1447,1447," I have! Lady Macbeth was always my favorite character but now I'm leaning towards Lady Macduff. A revival of the play about ~350 years ago gave her a bigger role and she's actually heroic, not murderous lol",7/3/2013 3:45
1447,1447," hahaha, well, it surprises me that is so updated. French dances, women, shortened monologues, I am curious to go to see it!",1/14/2018 3:56
1447,1406," Updated for the time period, you mean. King Charles II was raised in the French court and fell in love with Catholicism and all things French, so it made sense at the time to add these things to an English production",9/14/1973 6:51
1447,1447," Yes, I was thinking that you could enjoy the dialogue between Lady Macbeth and Lady Mcduff, would you like to be chatting with them?",8/23/2002 23:19
1447,1447," Not really! One ordered the murder of the other's children, if I remember correctly",3/8/2004 0:40
1448,1448," hahahahaha, you remember perfectly! I would have liked to see the witches singing  It's bonny, happy, chirpy, fun!",6/22/2015 20:36
1448,1707," That would be cool. It'd make a fun addition to double, double, toil and trouble, though I wonder if that was cut for speed? I sure hope not",7/19/1993 2:23
1448,1707, I hope not. I would be afraid to be in the Psychiatric Hospital Bedlam with real inmates acting the show. I know it is stupid. All of us are a little crazy. I think it is more like a lack of a certain substance in our brain that makes us crazy.,2/10/2009 5:32
1448,1707, Have you read other Shakespearian works? I read a bunch in high school and college and didn't even get past the tip of the iceberg (39 plays!),11/12/1999 9:59
1448,1707," Yes, I did. I am afraid to tell you, some of them have so many rolls, that I can't remembered all of them well. He was so huge mentally, to be able to make ensnaring with the acts and remember all the personages.",11/24/2003 9:31
1448,1448, I know what you mean about huge mentally. He actually made intentional grammatical errors to redirect the audience's attention. I feel that that was pretty ahead of his time,9/30/1994 9:33
1448,1707," He used to play with the words. I read that he was the one that created the phrase good bye. But in reality, he coined it as God by you, and with the time it shortened. Very interesting.",7/17/2009 8:26
1448,1448," The thing is, some phrases are attributed to him but I think that he may have been the first prominent person to document certain phrases rather than invent them",12/14/1995 11:21
1448,1707, Could be. What it means for you the phrase Good Riddance?,12/15/1989 3:11
1448,1707, It means it is good to be rid of someone or something. ,10/20/2018 2:11
1449,1449, Thank you. I think the girl in The Tempest was named Miranda. Did you read that Tchaikovsky donated his skull to make it pass for the skull of Yorick?.,2/1/1978 22:33
1449,1449," No way! I wonder why that was necessary? Was he a big fan of Shakespeare, then?",4/15/2009 13:28
1449,1449," Yes, I guess, he was himself a genius in the music. It was so nice to chat with you, I am giving you an excellent.",3/21/1972 9:20
1449,1662, Thank you! I love meeting a fellow fan of the Bard upon Avon :),12/26/2007 21:53
1449,1662, Me too! you are very literate!,4/8/1994 8:38
1449,1449," Maybe next time we meet, we can talk about the rest of the Bard's plays!",5/12/1998 13:03
1449,1662, Yes!,4/1/2015 12:23
1449,1449," Maybe also we can discuss some of the Greek epics, like Odysseus. I studied Classics on college and love Greek poetry!",6/27/2022 13:17
1449,1449, Good morning. Have you watched the Ethiopian celebrity chef? He's awesome.,11/3/1970 5:58
1449,1449, I have. The way he is trying to combat hunger in his country is just awe inspiring.,5/6/2006 13:51
1450,1450," It truly is. His Youtube channel is Grandpa Kitchen. I think they should have him on Sesame Street, like Carol Burnett.",12/21/1987 5:32
1450,1445, Im sad I missed that episode. She was a very funny lady. Lol. Did you now that Judge Judy makes 123000 per episode. ,7/12/1970 19:46
1450,1450," Yes she was. I saw that. It's crazy. Then again, so is the money LeBron makes.",5/15/1999 19:15
1450,1450, I bet both she and lebron have got to go to pixars secret room. I just wonder what they keep in there.,5/13/1980 10:56
1450,1445," I would love to visit that room. I wonder if Robin Williams ever did, aside from Aladdin, he did some work for Pixar as well. ",1/16/2006 8:27
1450,1445," With aladdin, Robin williams began the trend of celebrities voicing characters in animated films. He was a great man. I just love the work he did on the genie in aladdin.",7/4/1996 8:16
1450,1450," I didn't care for it. I would have loved to have been Cristiano Renaldo's agent, he bought him an island for his wedding.",6/12/2014 13:07
1450,1450, Wouldnt that be a crazy gift to recieve. He was also expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher.,8/5/1972 17:45
1450,1445," I think it's awesome that he won't get a tattoo, because he couldn't give blood. Thats impressive.",9/6/2007 13:50
1450,1450," That is a pretty good thing to do. Did you know that he is named after Ronald Reagan, his fathers favorite actor. Lol.",2/3/2007 7:31
1451,1451," I did not. I did know about the little boy whose education he paid for, he was a tsunami survivor.",9/16/1991 6:45
1451,396, Soccer makes more than football basketball baseball golf tennis and hockey does combined. I think it is a lot more popular in other parts of the world than in the US.,11/27/1972 17:46
1451,396," I have never watched a pro game, and was surprised to learn that we call it soccer' when it is really football.",7/25/1973 6:41
1451,1451, Well Im sure you know who jon stewart is from the daily show. He represented the US at the pan american maccabi games in brazil all the way back in 1983.,2/21/2004 1:40
1451,396, I do not know who he is. Did they play with three teams on the field at the same time?,6/19/2005 16:37
1451,396, I think most games are played with only two teams. Although there is a variation of the games that utilizes three teams in one game.,12/14/2015 14:59
1451,1451, I still find it hard to believe that it is the world's most popular sport.,9/10/2022 2:37
1451,396," Yeah me too a little bit, until you take into account that it is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries around the world. Then it makes sense.",4/15/2017 22:15
1451,1451," That's insane. I have to get to work, thanks for chatting with me. have a wonderful day.",8/26/2014 10:13
1451,1451," Hi, how are you?",11/28/1976 5:03
1452,1766," hey I'm good, how are you do you like soccer at all?",7/1/1984 2:19
1452,1452, I do like soccer. Do you?,8/4/1991 2:19
1452,1766," well I personally don't haha, but I do know that a soccer team scored on themselves one time, they did it on purpose because it would help them advance in a cup match!",2/25/1974 17:40
1452,1452, Makes sense... I can see them being too high in the next round and scoring to play a weaker team.,3/5/2013 20:19
1452,1452," yes that's what I'm thinking happened, also I didn't know that the super bowl is smaller than the third biggest event in soccer!",3/25/1994 19:35
1452,1766," Yeah. It's the world's game. The money is more than all 4 major sports in the us, combined!",12/29/2003 11:14
1452,1452, that is crazy! what is weird is that greenland can't join FIFA because there isn't enough grass there for a soccer field!,10/7/1975 10:49
1452,1766," That seems like it is limiting. What about turf. Why can't they play on turf, FIFA?",9/22/2020 3:23
1452,1452, ya I wonder if they require natural grass? I don't watch sports so I have no idea about the rules of soccer,12/7/1986 22:38
1452,1452," So if you don't watch sports, what do you do in your free time. I watch sports, all the time...",3/9/1995 20:35
1453,626," haha well I work and I also play piano and have other hobbies. I don't know. I don't miss sports. I know all my friends watch them, and I'll watch it if we're together, but I don't follow any teams or players or anything.",10/20/1998 4:33
1453,1453, You play the piano? How long have you played?,8/28/1986 1:33
1453,626," I've been playing for about 4 years now, I used to play video games but realized that the time you waste with those you never get back, so I started learning piano and I'd say I'm pretty good at this point, do you play any instruments?",11/10/1998 4:59
1453,1453, I used to play trumpet and did like it. I just ran out of time. I want to get my son into music. He wants to play the guitar so I am going to go that route...,6/9/2003 22:06
1453,626," ya it's definitely worth learning an instrument, the longer you play the better you will be so it would pay to have your son start early!",8/3/2020 19:55
1453,626, I just want to give him an outlet for his anger. He is 7 and likes sports but I want him to have another outlet for stress. Do you play for stress release?,5/9/2011 12:21
1453,1453," well I would say I play it because it's fun, personally. haha, I guess since its fun it's kind of like stress release, I am relieved to know that Paris Hilton holds the world record for most overrated celebrity",1/4/1982 7:37
1453,1453, There's a lot of people trying to take that crown though...,5/8/1973 13:11
1453,1453," ya, reminds me of Justin Bieber, how do you feel about him?",6/1/1993 14:01
1453,626, Very underwhelmed... Nice chatting with you!,1/27/1980 12:32
1454,1041," Hello there, are you a fan of movies?",12/17/1986 16:40
1454,1041," Hello, I love movies. What about you?",10/8/1973 4:08
1454,1041," Yeah I sure do, did you ever watch Stanley Kubrick movies?",4/10/1985 3:35
1454,1041, I've seen bits and pieces but never a full one. He seems to be quite the talented cinematographer though!,3/18/1999 1:05
1454,1454," Oh yeah he sure was, and Roger Deakins, did you ever hear about him?",1/8/1998 10:25
1454,1041, He is the guy who has been nominated a ton of times but never won right? Talk about always a bridesmaid never a bride. ,10/28/1994 10:19
1454,1454," Yeah good call, I guess 13 times and never won!",3/22/1991 17:05
1454,1041, That makes almost make me want to quit doing my job if that happened. But I suppose there is so much competition for the awards that you just keep trying. ,2/18/2004 6:41
1454,1454, That is very true.  Did you know that no women has ever been nominated for best cinematography?,1/24/1998 13:37
1454,1454, That seems crazy to me. You would think that after all this time that at least one woman would have at least been nominated. But with people like stanley kubrik and Gavin Free it is hard to break in. ,1/24/2002 9:04
1455,1455," Yeah I would think so as well, but I wonder how many female cinematographers there are?",2/15/2022 19:45
1455,1455, There has to be a minimal amount to justify never receiving a nomination. I would love to do the slow motion work for something. It would be a lot of fun. ,4/5/1994 18:41
1455,1455," Yeah that would be really cool, like doing some of the matrix scenes or something like that. ",10/17/1987 17:50
1455,1079, Yes! It seems so sexist in the industry though that women are relegated to wardrobe like the main concern of their life is clothes. ,5/18/2021 2:52
1455,1455," It really is, men and women should be getting the same pay, have same jobs, everything.  That old stuff is just that, old. ",10/2/2013 2:38
1455,1455," Exactly! I wonder how many of the facts we know about so much, like the sun or physics,  are because of women but they didn't get the credit. ",10/25/2018 18:26
1455,1079," Exactly, I'm sure there are quite a few, think of all of the wives of inventors and other people I'm sure they did some of the inventing!",7/29/1987 7:23
1455,1079, I do love that some of those inventors give their wives credit for their assistance. They acknowlege they wouldn't have made those discoveries without them. ,4/22/2012 8:17
1455,1079," Yeah and they should, like when they discovered the sun is actually white, not yellow because of atmospheric effect. ",7/5/1983 1:42
1455,1455," Or that it produces enough energy to power everything for 500,000 years in one second. Talk about an advertisement for alternative energy. ",5/23/2012 10:03
1456,1728," Yeah good call.  Well it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night!",1/5/1998 20:23
1456,1456," Hello, did you know that the sun is only 1,000,000,000th the size of the biggest star?",8/15/1976 13:07
1456,1728," Hi, how are you? That's amazing! The sun accounts for most of the mass in our solar system, yet it's not that big.",10/18/2009 11:24
1456,1456," I am doing good. Well, the sun is an obvious eye on Earth. ",12/8/2013 18:27
1456,1728, And most of us think that the eye is yellow. Actually it's white. The atmosphere makes the sun look yellow.,8/21/2010 18:28
1456,1728," I feel that I am looking at an optical illusion. I thought the sun was hotter, but a lightening bolt is way hotter.",4/17/2007 1:38
1456,1456, I think that's only compared to the surface of the sun. The interior is pretty hot. It would be great if we could capture more energy from the sun.,12/4/2014 12:11
1456,1728," Well the interior is where the core of the sun is, therefore it will be hot. Isn't the core of Earth the hotter area? The sun could save up the bill.",9/10/2002 19:50
1456,1456," The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years. Of course, we'd have to build a giant sphere around the sun to capture all of the energy coming from it.",3/28/1997 5:45
1456,1728, That is why we have solar panels. ,2/9/1974 20:52
1457,1457," If we could put giant solar panels in space, we could capture a ton of energy! That would be great! Are you interested in cinematography?",4/7/1979 23:09
1457,1712," It definitely will save us a lot of money. Not a big fan I know of it. However, it seems sexist to not have a nominated female.",6/16/2014 15:12
1457,1457, I'm not surprised. Hollywood doesn't have enough female directors or cinematographers. Things need to change. One guy has been nominated 13 times and never won!,8/4/1988 12:47
1457,1712, That is sad. Do you know who that person may be?,7/25/2006 2:33
1457,1712," Roger Deakins. I guess he is well known, but probably hasn't played the political game well. Have you heard of James Wong?",9/22/1983 5:16
1457,1457, I have not heard of James Wong. What was he known for?,5/10/1987 21:21
1457,1457," James Wong Howe was an oscar-winning cinematographer who pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography.",3/2/2018 4:38
1457,1712," Wow, that is a lot of knowledge for the future of cinematography.",9/27/2006 21:26
1457,1457," He was married to a white woman, but the marriage was not legal until 1948!",12/5/2002 15:12
1457,1712," Interesting, where was marriage not legal?",10/7/1971 10:47
1458,1357," I think in certain states, I don't know which ones. He was an American citizen by 1943, so it was entirely racism that made his marriage illegal.",8/13/2010 23:27
1458,1458," Well, good thing we are in the year of 2019. It was nice chatting with you.",6/7/2017 16:42
1458,1357," The sun is a pretty crazy thing, what do you think?",8/12/1991 14:03
1458,1357, It really is. Did you know that the sun is actually white. It just looks yellow because of atmospheric scattering.,12/17/2018 16:36
1458,1357," wow, I never knew that. I am so amazed about the sun, do you got any other interesting facts?",7/3/2018 20:19
1458,1357, Actually I do. A lightning bolt is actually 5x hotter than the surface of the sun. What do you think about that?,6/13/1987 23:11
1458,1458, I think that is insane and never need to feel the heat of any of them lol. ,12/21/2020 22:36
1458,1357, Scientists have shown that the sun creates enough energy in one second to meet our demands for 500000 years.,2/17/2000 6:55
1458,1357," wow, I wonder if there is anything that is able to catch all that energy and store it, do you think we have it?",10/11/1984 10:44
1458,1458," I know solar needs a lot of work to be effecient enough, but it is on the right trackin my opinion.",8/28/2004 22:50
1459,1459," That is a good point. I know a fact about Neptune, they have just completed their first full orbit of the sun since 1846!",5/5/2008 14:16
1459,1459, Thats cool to know. Did you also know that the sun is about 109 times the diameter of earth. ,6/16/1997 2:02
1459,1459," Wow that is so much! I know the sun is 1 billionth times smaller than the biggest star in the galaxy, makes me feel really small!",12/23/1998 12:50
1459,807, That is true. So what kind of clothing do you like. ,8/19/1996 7:01
1459,1459," I like nike and all the sporty type, but also i like polos to look clean, you?",1/6/1984 13:19
1459,807, I like to wear clothes like the pilgrims wore. Lol. They actually wore clothes that were full of color. Black was only or special occasions.,8/11/1974 22:08
1459,807," lol, I never knew that. They never taught that side of the pilgrims in school!",3/14/2003 20:36
1459,807, No they di not. Lol. I heard about a tore in alabama that only sells clothing and electronics that was left at baggage claim at the airport.,9/18/2016 19:19
1459,1459," wow, I need to get on over to Ohare and start a business from that. That is like pure profit!",2/17/2000 12:34
1459,1459, Were you aware that apple had a clothing line in 1986. Wonder why they stopped it?,1/13/2005 0:21
1460,1962," I never knew that. I would be rocking that right now! All the apple fans too would be into it also, they should bring it back! It was so nice chatting with you!",9/19/2016 10:41
1460,1962, Yeah I just want one of those shirts with the apple logo on it. Yep nicechat. Have a good one.,2/25/2006 4:29
1460,1962, Thanks! Enjoy your weekend!,5/5/2010 23:31
1460,1460," Hi, do you like soccer?",7/8/2011 19:54
1460,1460," I do enjoy soccer, have done all my life but I don't get to see much now.",1/24/2017 17:30
1460,1962, Are you an American soccer fan or european?,6/17/1987 7:53
1460,1962," I'm originally from England so stay in touch with the soccer that is played there, and also in Europe.",1/20/1996 12:00
1460,1460, Nice. I find English soccer so much more interesting that the professional soccer here. Who's your team?,2/24/1993 0:26
1460,1962," I always support a team called Everton, not too many have heard of them.  My local team were successful in the nineties but faded away, Wimbledon.",5/27/1986 7:56
1460,1962, I know Everton. They are on every once in a while. I usually watch them on NBC Sports while I clean or do chores around the house. ,3/8/2004 2:28
1461,369, They are the team that produced Wayne Rooney before he was purchase by Manchester united for a lot of money.  He plays for DC United here now.,4/5/1983 19:17
1461,369, I just know Rooney from his hair plugs! He is a really talented player!,2/20/1975 0:35
1461,1461," He was a team mate of that Christano Ronaldo, I hear he's in trouble with the police now.",3/8/2020 1:36
1461,369, Ronaldo? For what? I know there was a tax thing and a sexual assualt but is there more now?,7/20/1982 3:52
1461,369," Yes there was the tax thing, many players get hit with that one.  The one I was thinking of is the sexual assault in Las Vegas.  Not sure how he'll fight that one in the long term.",5/8/2004 18:08
1461,1461, Me either. I have a feeling that it will involve a large settlement.,6/20/2010 16:50
1461,369," I guess he's done that already, he paid $375,000 for a legal settlement, but a German newspaper found out and made it public.",9/23/2013 17:05
1461,1461," I did not know that. So he's not in legal trouble, just media trouble.",10/3/2010 21:33
1461,1461, Apparently the woman in question has now approached the Las Vegas police and they have opened an investigation.  Not sure how it works if he is in Italy and they are here.,9/19/1986 12:12
1461,1461, I am surprised Nike has not dropped him though.,7/1/1970 9:48
1462,1462," Not yet, expressed concern but so far are sticking with him.  I suppose he is innocent until proven guilty.  The MeToo movement is moving through just about every industry.",12/29/2016 12:41
1462,1594, yeah. I feel bad for the way women have been treated. I am sure there are a lot of skeletons still in closets.,1/24/1987 22:55
1462,1594," If people have acted criminally then they should face the consequences.  I have a young daughter and hope she will be safe when she is an adult, I'm all for MeToo.",12/2/1985 3:41
1462,1594, MeToo!!!! Mine is 5 and I would move some furniture if something happened to her. Nice chatting with you?,2/1/1981 11:31
1462,1594," Not the best subject to end on, but hopefully the long run will see benefits.  Good bye.",7/27/1972 12:07
1462,1462," Hi, how are you?",1/26/2007 14:47
1462,1594," Hello there, I am well thank you.  How are you today?",9/9/2013 19:43
1462,1594, I'm great! Are you a fan of sports? ,10/24/2004 5:16
1462,1462," I am I like pretty much most sports, and I always cheer for all my local teams. ",12/30/2012 1:13
1462,1462, Are you into wrestling? It's a sport that I really don't know well.,1/4/2013 1:53
1463,649," No not really, but I do respect it quite a bit.  How about you, are you a fan?",10/21/1991 14:25
1463,1463," Not really a fan. I think it's cool that Lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame. Lost only once in approximately 300 matches. I wonder how Trump would do, with his bone spurs and such.",4/7/1995 5:03
1463,1463," Really? I would never have thought that, what a cool fact.  Yeah I doubt Trump could beat anyone. ",12/7/2004 1:10
1463,1463,  Plato was a professional wrestler before he became a philosopher. Maybe sports excellence and thinking go together. Are you into baskeball?,6/30/1991 13:15
1463,1463," Yeah especially wrestling I guess.  Yeah I really like basketball, my favorite team is leading the league so far this year.  How about you?",2/12/1981 18:39
1463,1463," I like the pro game but I feel that the game has distorted college. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. Something seems askew.",11/15/1993 0:45
1463,1463," Yeah that doesn't make much sense to me, I think the pay for pro athletes is way too high as well. ",6/29/1991 4:36
1463,649," At the pro level, I don't care. They make money, but the owners make more. I would rather see money going to make college less expensive, especially since it's getting exhorbitant. ",7/18/1985 3:08
1463,1463," Yes, I can totally agree with that, they could use that extra money and put it back into lower tuition. ",1/4/1977 13:56
1463,649, Universities are  supposed to deal with knowledge: teaching and research. Not provide entertainment.Kareem's  use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball. I wonder how fans now would react to that. ,7/23/1993 1:14
1464,284," I never knew that, very interesting.  Do you know who the inventor of basketball was?",4/20/2003 20:18
1464,1464, Canadian guy named Naismith. Wanted a sport for his players to do in the off-season.,5/26/2021 20:00
1464,1464, Yeah good call it was James Naismith.  I wonder what he would think of the game today. ,12/13/1984 22:10
1464,1464, It's evolved. The inside game with big men is over. Now the 3pointer has changed the balance. No need to be tall if you can shoot well.,8/16/2020 4:15
1464,284, Yeah well now you have to be tall and still able to shoot the three.  It is interesting how the game evolves over time. ,8/16/2001 6:50
1464,1464," Well, Ive enjoyed chatting with you about basketball!",3/28/2003 15:38
1464,1464," Yeah same here, it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",10/31/2002 16:17
1464,1464," Morning! Wow, I haven't thought about sports since high school. I didn't realize competitive wrestling really is.",5/15/1988 23:41
1464,284," Apparently its as competitive as other sports, I just to wrestle in high school so it would be nice to remember those times.",8/18/2001 7:05
1464,284," Oh did ya?  I was never very sporty in high school, but I had a friend who wrestled and I remember how he was always so concerned with his weight and trying to make sure he kept in the right weight class. Seemed a very strict kind of sport, like you need to be very diligent to participate.",7/22/2006 17:21
1465,1465," Yeah I can see why, you have to mantain a certain weight, have you seen Marvin Joseph? he is a grea wrestler, one of the best I have ever seen.",4/2/2009 0:08
1465,1465," I haven't heard of Marvin Joseph as a wrestler - I'm sorry to say the extent of my knowledge about wrestling is pretty much limited to The Rock. But I just learned that even Plato was a pro wrestler before he became a philosopher. Do you think it's the kind of thing you can pick up again, like riding a bike? ",2/1/2010 15:13
1465,1465," Sorry I mean River Curtis, I got confused with the reporter from the Washington Post, Curtis won the Wrestler of the year award, and I think it is, it might be harder than riding a bike again but the body has memory and with hard work its possible",11/11/2004 6:41
1465,1769," Do you think if you had kids you would encourage them to try out wrestling? I can't tell if it's something that would be great for teaching determination and self-control, or if it could lead to eating disorders and the like. If you could do it all again, would you still have wrestled?",12/20/2005 10:58
1465,1465," I think I would, I just to like it and maybe my kids would too, I would want them to play sports thats for sure, you know Lincoln was a wresler, he is on the hall of hame even",2/7/1987 20:09
1465,1465," It's so weird to think of these serious people once being wrestlers. I mean, you have them on the one side, and the other end where folks in Turkey are dousing themselves in oil to wrestle - that oil wrestling sounds more like a spectacle than a serious sport but I guess to each his own, lol.",10/2/2003 16:40
1465,1769," I agree, it was suprising to me to learn that Lincoln was a wresler and a good one as well, you know who Denis Cyplenkov is?",6/27/2000 19:57
1465,1465," Yes! I heard he has the biggest and most muscled hands in the world. Mind-boggling, I wonder what he looks like. I'd be kind of interested to watch a wrestling match. Do you prefer something more like competitive wrestling, or something more like the wrestling  you see on TV?",7/7/1970 19:54
1465,1769," Yeah not only a champion but a bodybuilder as weell and I prefer competitive wresling better, what about you? any preferences?",10/6/1976 10:44
1465,1465," I feel like if I was going to watch it, I'd prefer competitive - it seems more real and less like a show. Not that there's anything wrong with a show, but I think I'd rather see the competition than the show. I think it would be cool to watch that Wrestler of the Year, Curtis, in action.",5/20/2016 10:01
1466,962," It would be interesting indeed, do you like any other sports? Im a basketball fan as well.",2/9/2004 3:36
1466,1466," Well to be honest, I'd definitely watch basketball over wrestling. I love the fast pace. And I just learned that there's even a basketball court on the top floor of the Supreme Court building. How cool is that!?",6/9/1984 2:31
1466,1466," Yeah me too, I like basketball better, and really? I didnt know that, it must be a really cool court, I wonder if they host tournaments in there",4/25/1976 12:03
1466,962," I hope they do - if not, seriously, why do they even have it? Maybe the Justices take their recesses up there and Ruth Bader Ginsberg can actually dunk the ball! Haha! It's great exercise. Do you play at all?",3/6/1976 21:51
1466,1466," I used to play it but not anymore, now I just watch it lol, there is a team called Tall Blacks in New Zealand, that sounds racial.",8/16/1983 21:15
1466,962," It really does, doesn't it? I wonder if it's just a cultural difference and maybe they don't feel that way in New Zealand. You know if you said that in the U.S. you'd go viral for all the wrong reasons! I guess the New Zealand team must just be extremely tall, eh? I had no idea the dunk shot got banned from college basketball for a while, did you know that?",11/1/1988 2:03
1466,962," Yeah, you could get in a lot of trouble for naming a team like that, and I didnt know that either, I wonder why they decided to ban the dunk shot lol, its one of the best moves in basketball.",8/22/2021 21:58
1466,962," Definitely super dramatic, a good crowd pleaser, lol. I'm going sign off after this, great chatting with you!!",6/3/1982 3:30
1466,962," Its been great chatting with you as well, I will go and watch some basketball videos in YouTube now.",12/9/2016 14:21
1466,962," I have a love/hate relationship with running, but I can appreciate people who can do it and do it well like Donald Ritchie",11/12/1994 9:41
1467,1932," Same here, I have run one marathon and never plan to again, I couldnt imagine being an ultra runner",6/10/1974 19:39
1467,1467, I'm surprised that someone who runs so much died at 73. I would have thought he would have lived longer from being healthy,1/21/1992 23:14
1467,1932," I dont think they every released an official cause of death, but yes, somone who could run 3 marathons a day for 10 days straight certainly must have been in tip top shape.",3/22/2008 9:24
1467,1932, Maybe all the running was hard on his heart. He's from Scotland and never ran a race in his kilt. I'm not sure if those are very aerodynamic,2/9/1979 13:22
1467,1467," They do seem like theyd be very heavy, especially to keep up that 7 minute per mile pace - even when he was running 100 miles.  I cant even do that for one mile.",6/19/1998 13:24
1467,1467," I guess that's how he got the name ultrarunner. It's kinda gross, but one of his secrets was urinating while running rather than stopping at the portable toilets",9/17/1982 11:39
1467,1932," That was one part of running I could never do, I didnt want the urine soaked shoes.  Plus it just sounds gross.",11/24/2000 4:53
1467,1467," That's a convincing enough reason for me to never pursue running at that level. I wonder how many pairs of shoes he would go through compared to ballet dancers. At the professional level, they may have to use four pairs in only a week",11/9/2008 4:55
1467,1467," That is hard to believe, I wonder why they havent made them hold up better for the dancers.  That would be pretty expensive.",2/14/2017 4:40
1467,1467," Maybe the problem is that shoes in modern times aren't the same quality they used to be. I've heard that shoes from 5,000 years ago actually perform better than what you buy at the store now",1/17/1981 10:26
1468,1084, That is surprising seeing as some shoes now that are considered to have complex construction and made with expensive material can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.,9/12/2006 1:07
1468,1468," Then again, some of those are high fashion shoes that sell for exorbitant amounts of money. I've never had too much problem with smelly shoes, but if I ever do, I'm putting tea bags in them to absorb the odor",2/27/1972 6:04
1468,1468," I have had problems with some really smelly shoes, usually when they get wet.  I will need to try the tea bag thing next time it happens.",5/31/1975 22:08
1468,1084," If it works, it's a cheap solution, though not as cheap as the shoes Stephon Marbury promoted, but wasn't paid to endorse. Maybe it's because they sold for only $15",2/8/1997 1:04
1468,1084, Maybe those are the same shoes Steve Smith leaves on the field after each game to raise awareness to the homeless people without shoes.,12/22/1997 17:46
1468,1084," I wonder if he buys his cleats in bulk. He probably doesn't choose his cleats based on fashion, but more about function",5/7/1997 6:12
1468,1468," Most likely, thats how I treat my shoes.  They are for comfort and function and doesnt matter how they look, or if they are popular.",7/11/1988 18:45
1468,1468, I wonder which shoes are the best for traveling around the world. King Kalakaua of Hawaii probably had a good pair on his trek to become the first king to travel around the world,8/31/1978 1:37
1468,1468," They would have to be pretty durable, there are some places like Mackinac Island where motorized vehicles are banned.",11/14/2008 15:23
1468,1468, That's a lot of walking and biking to places. I wonder how healthy they are in comparison to other places,9/21/2019 11:10
1469,1267, Donald Ritchie just died - man he was amazing at running long distances,3/22/2021 20:42
1469,1469, He was. He set many world records!,4/1/1976 8:58
1469,1469, I cannot imagine running for 24 hours straight like he set records doing!,1/24/1996 14:48
1469,1469," Me either! I'm really not fond of running. Speaking of sports, did you know ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes per week?",3/1/2007 11:34
1469,1267, Yes that is a lot of money!  I wonder why 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes?,3/29/1985 23:51
1469,1267," I'm guessing they were just made with better materials, though i'm not sure. I wonder what the first shoe was made out of.",7/10/2003 22:54
1469,1469, I am not sure.  I do know I always stick dry tea bags in my sons shoes - they stink and it helps with the odor,6/26/1977 15:25
1469,1267, Seems like a pretty good idea. My son also has really stinky shoes!,10/17/1995 14:04
1469,1267, I need to buy him more of Stephen Marbury's shoes - they were only $15 and he was actually paid to not endorse them,4/5/2006 1:32
1469,1267," Hm, that's interesting. Who is Stephen Marbury? ",4/18/2014 12:23
1470,1615, He is a well known NBA player.  I like Steve Smith as well - he is an NFL player who leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness of the homeless,9/18/1998 20:18
1470,1615, That's a really cool thing for him to do. Do you travel much?,6/7/2002 20:24
1470,1615, I love to travel though I am not sure of going 160 miles per hour on a bus in the Netherlands!,6/16/1993 21:15
1470,1615, That seems pretty scary. I heard talk of them making a really fast mode of transportation like that in America too.,11/30/2018 16:14
1470,1615, But no on Mackinac Island - only bicycles or horse drawn carriages,12/10/2000 14:51
1470,1615, I'm sure its very peaceful there. I walk a lot and one thing I hate are cars whizzing past me! ,8/14/2012 5:17
1470,1470, No doubt.  In Iceland people without cars have to fly - there are no trains there,11/8/1979 5:59
1470,1615, I'm sure that could get pretty annoying when visiting. In Japan the highway tolls can cost more than 300$ to travel across country! ,10/10/2021 20:42
1470,1615, Yes I have been to Japan!  Everything is expensive there!  I wonder if it was back when King Kalakaua traveled the world?,3/31/1981 23:04
1470,1615, I've always wanted to visit Japan! I wonder what the king thought of places in Asia and Europe.,12/10/2002 9:59
1471,266, That is a good question.  I definitely liked the food better in Europe!,5/14/1991 12:43
1471,266, Do you Run?,12/31/1996 17:39
1471,266," No, I don't.  Do you?",9/7/2011 21:33
1471,266," No, I was reading about Donald Ritchie though. He passed away at 73. I guess he was a gifted runner.",3/25/2014 17:14
1471,1471," Yeah, it seemed like it.  I had never heard of ultrarunning before.  Hard to imagine running that far!",6/20/1983 20:04
1471,266," I can't imagine running for 5 minutes, let alone over 2 hours.",10/4/1983 1:20
1471,266, LOL.  Me too!  My knees are hurting even thinking about it,8/3/2017 3:13
1471,1471, Amen! This guy ran for 100 miles around London's crystall place. He would be able to go anywhere just by running there!,10/2/1977 3:44
1471,266," That is so nuts.  He did it all with under 7 minute miles, too.  That is impressive!",1/15/1987 3:58
1471,266, And he did 844 miles in 10 days! Wow!,2/7/2021 20:41
1472,1073, I like how he said you must be a little crazy when explaining ultrarunning lol  ,12/30/1978 17:44
1472,1073," I guess so. It must be addicting too. Urinating while running though, Gross!",10/2/1990 5:01
1472,1472," Yeah, that's a dealbreaker for sure lol just imagine the smell!",2/23/2016 14:56
1472,1472, Terrible! I guess quite a few people thought he ran in his kilt! ,10/23/1986 18:39
1472,1073, Right.  He did wear it hoping to get a lift from Scotland to Finland lol,4/7/2009 5:43
1472,1472, Must have had excellent legs! At 18 he found out he had more stamina then most for running. Thats a long career!,4/26/1980 11:18
1472,1073, LOL it definitely is!  And he only accepted a sponsor that provided him with shoes,10/24/2005 11:17
1472,1073, Good guy! Both his parents died from cancer. That's pretty sad.,5/4/1983 16:18
1472,1073," Yeah, that is sad.  Apparently he had heart problems. ",3/27/1987 14:00
1472,1472, After all that running? You would think he would have a perfect heart! Joe Jackson died too apparently. ,4/15/2021 14:04
1473,1473, It is surprising.  You'd think he would be in great shape.  I wonder if the running was too much and caused his heart to be unders stress to often. ,8/25/1984 21:47
1473,1473," Maybe so, he said he often ran dehydrated. That could really stress your heart.",7/24/1986 3:09
1473,552, It absolutely can. Have a great day!,11/22/1996 1:07
1473,552, Good morning!! I learned a little interesting trivia... Denis Cyplenkov has the biggest and most dense muscles in the whole world!! He's an arm wresting champion... go figure!!,4/14/1998 5:08
1473,1473," Wow!  His hands must be intense!!  I don't know a lot about wrestling, but it's pretty funny that the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling!",10/18/1981 22:22
1473,1473, Haha!!! That's pretty interesting!! Abraham Lincoln was pretty good at wrestling... He only lost once in 300 matches...that's pretty impressive!! It earned him a spot in the Wrestling Hall of Fame!!,1/13/2005 1:26
1473,552, That is impressive...of all the things people talk about with Abe Lincoln why do they leave that out?  I'm sure he was pretty proud of it!  Plato was a professional wrestler before becoming a famous philosopher.  I always pictured his more bookish...but I guess I was wrong!,10/15/1971 5:15
1473,1473," Strong arms are not just good for wrestling, it helps when you're dunking basketballs, too. Kareem abdul Jabbar had his dominant dunk shot banned from college basketball...I guess those arms were dunking a little bit too strong!!",3/17/2011 18:25
1473,552," That just doesn't seem fair!  The guy was good at dunking, so they punished him?!?  Speaking of basketball, the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only coach in the University of Kansas's history to lose!",6/27/2006 9:44
1473,1473, Too bad for him because I know it had to affect his pay. In 39 out of 50 states the profession that is highest paid by the state is either a college basketball coach or a college football coach.,12/18/1972 13:44
1474,91, I could see that.  I think if he invented the sport it likely wasn't making much money to begin with.  I think it's probably more embarrasing than anything else!  The Highest Court in the Land is on the top floor of the Supreme Court!  I like their sense of humor!,10/22/2020 21:24
1474,91," Yes!!! Well, basketball isn't the only sport affected by bans of things that helped perfermance, in the world of swimming, there is a swimsuit that was worn 94% of the time in winning swim races... and now that suit has been BANNED!!! ",5/4/1992 7:16
1474,1474, Well it makes sense to ban that!  I can't believe the technology in cloths...was it made out of dolphin skin?  That's pretty impressive!  Have you ever heard of the crawl stroke?  Is it like the butterfly stroke?,3/25/1998 7:08
1474,91, I haven't heard of the crawl stroke but I am quite impressed with the competitive swimming where hands and legs are tied and the swimmer has nothing else to help their performance while they swim like a dolphin!!! Sheer strength is whats needed to be competitive there!!,6/13/1992 7:46
1474,91," That is very impressive!  I think I would drown if I tried that... I guess in a swimming competition between the British and the Native Americans, the Natives Americans won with their front crawl swimming stroke.  The British relied on the breast stroke and lost!",1/18/1991 22:32
1474,1474," Swimming is quite competitive, indeed! The United States seems to hold its own worldwide... The U.S. has as many gold medals as the rest of the whole world COMBINED!! Pretty impressive!!",8/2/2000 11:42
1474,1474," That is impressive!  I wonder how many of those we won with those fancy swimming suits?  Humans can hold their breaths underwater and swim within weeks of birth, too bad more parents don't get their kids swimming so young.  Maybe then the US would hold ALL the gold metals!!",7/5/1994 7:31
1474,1474," I agree!! Cornell University has a requirement that ALL students MUST pass a simple, basic swim test BEFORE they can graduate!! More schools and Universities should follow suit with that!! Starting with elementay school, swimming should be required.",4/14/1972 21:36
1474,1474," I had to take swimming lessons all through school, as a teenager I hated having swimming class and then rushing to get ready for the next class afterwards.  That was the only downside.  But I made sure to go to a college that didn't require a PE, lol!",9/14/2010 4:52
1474,1474," I remember swimming in high school too. Swimming, basketball, wrestling, they all have some pretty impressive athletes with some impressive records... there are too many to mention but in the world of wrestling, WRESTLER OF THE YEAR, River Curtis caught my attention. He weighs only 138 pounds!! Wow!!",5/12/2020 12:17
1475,1475," Wow, that's impressive.  I assume wrestlers only wrestle those within a similar body weight...but still.  King Sandoval wrestled with a minor fracture and multiple torn ligaments in his right hand, he managed to take thrid at the National Prep Championships!",3/12/1997 7:53
1475,1475," Wow!!! King Sandoval must have mastered all the pins, grappling holds, joint locks and takedowns to make him wear that crown proudly!! Wrestling has definitely allowed him to maintain a superior position!!",9/17/1973 9:19
1475,1475," Yeah, no kidding!  Another great champion was Nathaniel White, he won Bowie's first state championship in THIRTY YEARS!  I'm sure he'll be a local hero forever!!",9/11/1979 14:06
1475,587," I bet he will!! It's going to hard to beat that record!! WoW!!! Well, its been a pleasure talking to you today. Enjoy the rest of your day!! Good-bye!!!",8/5/1984 11:43
1475,587," You as well, bye!",3/21/2011 0:25
1475,1475, What do you think about Morgan Freeman? I always thought he was a good guy but it seems like he's being accused of sexual harassment,5/6/2009 20:22
1475,587," Yeah, I was also disappointed when Cosby first got accused because I watched his show growing up. A lot of women have come forward and there were lots of witnesses too.",3/22/2020 18:28
1475,587," Yep I agree, a lot of times they don't have any proof so you don't know who to believe either. He was nominated for five Oscars, it would be a shame if this tarnished his legacy",12/25/2016 12:51
1475,1475," Sad that it happened so late in life too. I just don't know. I would think he would be smarter than that, but who knows.",10/3/1970 0:57
1475,587, Yes I don't know. What do you do for entertainment? Do you watch a lot of movies or play video games perhaps,3/10/2013 6:32
1476,690, I used to play video games in the original Nintendo era. Now I just watch Netflix.,10/9/2019 18:54
1476,690," Yes I played the original Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 80s, it can only display 54 colors but that never bothered me",6/28/2001 12:42
1476,690," I know, i thought it was awesome. Suprising that it did not get discontinued till 2013.",3/7/2010 8:16
1476,690," Yep it was definitely very popular! Kind of like how chickens were very popular in Britain, that use them for entertainment back in the time of 50 BC",9/3/1994 3:58
1476,1476," Yeah, I used to watch tv shows like Bill Nye when I was not playing Nintendo. Did you ever watch Bill Nye when you were younger? He got his break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike costume.",6/23/1988 3:30
1476,1476," That's a really interesting way to get started with a career! So was Ronald Reagan, he was told he didn't look presidential but obviously we know how that turned out LOL",11/21/1991 14:51
1476,1476, Hilarious! I wonder how Morgan Freeman got his start. I know that he played a singing vampire obsessed with vegetables on the electric company. Maybe that was one of his first gigs because that does not sound very cool haha.,4/12/1979 12:00
1476,690," That is interesting. I did like him in the movie Seven though, he was in that with Brad Pitt did you see that movie?",7/30/1996 7:25
1476,1476, I don't think I did. Will have to check that out. Samuel I Jackson was mentored by Morgan Freeman.,2/18/1978 22:58
1476,690," Wow I didn't know that. I like both of them actually, did you know that Morgan Freeman plays golf one-handed? I know that Samuel Jackson plays a lot of golf, I wonder if they ever played together ",4/28/1993 8:46
1477,1477," Interesting, and I guess that was not by choice as he hurt his left hand in a car crash. Wonder if he is any good.",3/28/2018 11:48
1477,1477," Yes I wonder about that too, did you ever see the movie Driving Miss Daisy by the way? That's one of my favorites and he was in it, he played the driver",4/17/1997 14:01
1477,1086," I did not see that either. It is probably good, most of his stuff is. He has been nominated for and won more awards than the number of movies he has been in.",12/20/2010 9:46
1477,1477," It is very impressive! I don't think he has as many wins as Daniel Day-Lewis does though, he won best actor three times",10/20/1992 17:21
1477,1477," Speaking of oscars, the oscars were nominated for nine emmys in 2013. ",12/24/1976 17:05
1477,1477," That is interesting how they can feed off each other like that, have you ever seen the movie Blazing Saddles by the way? It was nominated for three Oscars",9/11/2006 15:47
1477,1477, I have always been a fan of comedy. How about you?,8/22/2004 21:57
1477,1086," Yes, I do like comedy but horror movies are my favorite.  What is your favorite movie?",5/7/2017 4:44
1477,1086, One of my favorites of all time is the Life of Brian. Have you seen it?,5/29/2010 12:44
1477,1477," Oh my goodness, I watched that years and years ago, I can't really remember much about the movie.  Who starred in it?",1/18/1976 17:17
1478,1478, It was the cast of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Eric Idle is one that most people would know in America. Cause he did a lot of American Movies.,9/9/2000 11:54
1478,1499," Yes, I remember it now. I can remember babysitting for my neighbors when I was a teen and the late night show was Monty Python, I would watch it but the comedy skits went right over my head, so to speak.  Now, as an adult, I can appreciate it more.",10/24/2020 3:22
1478,1499, I watched it on PBS because it had nudity in the cartoons. I guess PBS could get away with that. You didn't see that on the regular networks.,5/7/2018 12:25
1478,1478, That is so true!  PBS and Do you remember the National Geographic magazines showing the natives of other countries topless?,3/2/1984 1:44
1478,1478," Oh lord. Yeah, you would go to the library to see those. At least we did, we couldn't afford a subscription. I found out that George Harrison paid for the production of their movie.",12/8/1995 11:56
1478,1478," I didn't know that, about George Harrison. Did you know that the highest paid tv celebrity is Judge Judy? She gets 123,000 per episode! I should have been a judge....lol",11/14/2022 22:13
1478,1478, I didn't even know she was still on TV. I like the MEMEs they make with her forehead slapping unbelievable face. I wonder if she has ever been on Sesame Street. I heard Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on it.,6/7/2006 17:11
1478,1478," yes those are funny. I love Carol Burnett, she's such great comedian and a nice person.  Have you seen the youtube videos that make collaboration of judge judy episodes? They are great videos.",6/29/1991 18:18
1478,1499, I haven't. I'll have to look it up. I need to see if the old Mython's are there too. It's said that Chapman died. I heard he got drunk on set a lot.,3/27/2017 15:22
1478,1478," Yes i heard that too, I think Chapman is dead. There's not any real good tv like there used to be. Most of the time I watch old perry mason, andy griffith and a lot of 80's shows like Charlies Angels, Matlock, etc. Thank goodness for reruns....lol",5/19/1978 13:11
1479,1479," I stopped watching regular TV.  I only stream things recorded on my iPhone. No cable, no networks, no Dish. Save's a lot of money. Don't have a lot like Lebron who is the second highest paid after Judy.",4/26/1986 1:21
1479,1479," I can't wait until my 190.00 a month cable contract is up, I'm canceling it and doing like you do, stream only with internet. My elderly mom lives with me, I take care of her, that's why I have the cable to begin with.  She wouldn't understand how to stream anything, never been on a computer and doesn't want to learn it at all.",5/23/2004 19:20
1479,1887," OOps, I meant Judy was second after Lebron. You can get shows off YouTube that she will like. You can download Youtube for just 9..99 a month. I like comedies with Robin Williams, I found out he was the first celebrity to do the voice for a animated film. It was Aladdin.",1/11/2009 2:28
1479,1887," Oh ya, I remember youtube sending me a message, that they have streaming tv now for cheap. I loved Robin Williams, I didn't know he was the first.",3/1/1990 1:32
1479,1887, Actually I also cancelled wifi. I found out you can download to your phone at the library and then watch it at home with no connection. I get Prime Video because I like Prime anyway for free shipping. They have a ton of great shows. Probably second only to Netflix.,3/15/1979 8:48
1479,1479," Oh, that's a smart idea. I like that. Yes I have the Prime service also, such a great thing and I love the 2 day free shipping, you can't beat it. I buy everything that way now.",9/23/2018 8:46
1479,1887," Also, they have Prime music. I just found out that Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack. I bet they have Jaws on Prime. In Richmond V.A. they 2 hour shipping for Prime Members.",6/6/2001 12:20
1479,1479," I  bet they do have Jaws on Prime, wow Steven Spielberg plays Clarinet like me! The 2 hour shipping is a fantastic option also.",5/21/1995 11:22
1479,1887, Do you enjoy reading?,1/10/2002 0:41
1479,1887," It's actually one of my favorite pastimes. I definitely would have been part of the Moral Panic had I lived in the 18th century, because I love novels",4/9/1996 10:03
1480,1227, I like reading since it promotes deep exploration of texts and can help build worlds in your mind,5/30/2012 9:11
1480,1227," I mean, even the military has reading lists. I heard three of the five branches have added Starship Troopers as their first sci-fi novel",9/11/2017 6:51
1480,1480, I think ender's game is another recommendation for the military. I loved it in high school,4/11/2000 4:12
1480,1480," I haven't read it, but I should add that to my list. I wish I could read anywhere close to the world record held by Anne Jones. 4,700 wpm would get me through a lot of books",4/9/1991 11:59
1480,1227, I wonder how much of the 4700 she actually digests,7/25/2019 23:17
1480,1480," A skill like that would only be helpful if you have a photographic memory. Though, I wouldn't want to remember all the terrible poetry if I entered a You Laugh You Lose contest like the ones C.S. Lewis and Tolkien would hold",10/2/1991 20:57
1480,1480, This is kind of a digression but lebron james has photographic memory so he can replay every game he has ever played,1/26/2016 15:48
1480,1480, That's impressive! I wonder if he has interest in reading. Everyone likes a good fiction book,9/8/1970 22:22
1480,1227, Is fiction your favorite genre?,6/24/1988 9:42
1480,1227, Most of the time. It would be interesting to find the wiki that ranks fictional characters. Not all of them have powers and abilities,7/17/2002 17:32
1481,1, Do you prefer fiction or fantasy?,3/23/2021 3:40
1481,1, It depends on the author. I think mostly fiction. I should tru to find the writing Edgar Allen Poe did that has a cyborg,10/6/1982 12:26
1481,1, So did Poe create the concept of cyborgs?,1/11/1978 11:06
1481,1," He's the oldest known example, so I guess the credit goes to him",8/8/2017 23:29
1481,1481," I mean it is a shame how credit isn't always fairly awarded. I remember there was a seclusive scientist who found a dozen or so elements decades before other scientists yet since he never was too public about his research, the credit went to those scientists",6/21/1986 0:41
1481,1481, Wow. I wonder if that was the beginning of science fiction. There was a comic in the 50s that a judge tried to ban because one of the characters is black,4/29/2007 4:44
1481,1481, That judge should have been banned from court instead,11/2/2006 1:42
1481,1481, It's possible that he was. Do you ever read fan fiction?,1/27/1995 21:25
1481,1, Rarely. Do you?,7/17/1989 17:20
1481,1481," Not really, but the fan fiction that Julius Caesar wrote about Hercules would likely be an interesting read",5/6/2007 1:11
1482,99," Hi there, do you watch movies at al?",5/6/2007 4:24
1482,99," I do, my favorite genre is comedy, do you like movies?",8/30/1993 13:23
1482,1482, Yeah that is my favorite genre too. Do you like bromantic comedies then?,10/31/1977 7:05
1482,1482," Yeah The Hangover is one of my favorite movies, well all 3 of them, ",6/20/2015 4:24
1482,99, I loved that movie too. How about tv shows that are comedies? Like 3rd rock from the sun?,4/10/2016 5:24
1482,1482," I havent heard about that show before, is it any good?",2/26/1991 11:29
1482,99," I have seen a few episodes of it and it is good but I do not think it is better than Friends, however it beat it to win an award",8/10/2000 2:36
1482,1482," I love Friends thats like my favorite show and yeah doesnt seem righ, do you know who Demetri Martin is",9/3/2002 4:59
1482,99," Yeah he is a super funny guy, guess it paid off to drop off of Harvard Law to pursue comedy",1/17/1978 3:43
1482,1482," I guess it did, hard decision to make though",9/9/2012 19:25
1483,1483, True. Do you know who Ryan Stiles is?,1/24/2018 14:07
1483,1483," No, who is Ryan Stiles is he also a famous comedian?",8/29/2017 12:46
1483,1674, Yeah he is and similarly he dropped out of high school to focus on comedy,4/9/1994 2:36
1483,1674," I guess that paid off for him as well, still a harsh decision, if your dream is comedy you must at least finish high school and then persue it",1/20/1992 22:43
1483,1674," I agree but good thing it worked for him. Speaking of famous people, do you know who is the highest paid celebrity?",7/29/2019 15:56
1483,1674, Im guessing its Judge Judy she makes about $123000 per episode when you sum it up its a lot of money,11/22/1977 13:54
1483,1674, Yeah she is the second one in the list I think with LeBron being the first guy,3/17/2018 12:57
1483,1483," Oh thats right, Lebron does earn a lot of money, that makes sense, did you know there is a secret room at Pixar studios",3/9/2005 17:40
1483,1483, Is that the one that only celebrities are allowed to access?,10/25/1995 15:26
1483,1483," Yeah celebrities, directors and wealthy people, did you like Robin Williams in Aladdin? ",10/11/1980 10:40
1484,1500, I did and he was the first guy to stat the trend of celebrities doing voices. ,10/6/2012 16:03
1484,1484," Hi, how are you?",4/16/1980 7:01
1484,1484, I'm doing great! Did you know that Adam Sandler has a special on Netflix?,3/15/1987 4:58
1484,1484, I heard about it. Supposedly it was really good. Did you see it?,5/20/2015 17:00
1484,1484," I haven't. I'm luke warm on watching anything of his. Sometimes it's hilarious, but a lot of times for me it falls flat. ",2/22/2003 14:45
1484,1500, Yeah. I usually end up drinking too much and then thinking turning on one of his movies would be a great idea. Then I end up drinking more to pass the time and then fall asleep an hour in. It's a vicious cycle.,12/29/2015 10:19
1484,1500," That sounds about what happens with me as well. I really like a lot of the newer shows that Netflix has been producing though, I'm sure it has to cost them quite a lot though. ",1/4/2001 9:21
1484,1500," What shows are you getting into. Everytime I open netflix, nothing really pops out to me...",10/25/2020 11:00
1484,1500," The new Sabrina show was awesome. I really enjoyed it as a comic when I was younger, and I was happy with how well it was done. I only use the online streaming service, but I remember when it first started getting dvd's in the mail. ",6/5/2017 9:37
1484,1500, Me too! And were you a comic when you were younger or the younger show of Sabrina that was a comedy?,7/5/1997 20:39
1485,1728, Sabrina was a comic book when I was a kid. I read it back then. ,5/27/1995 23:41
1485,1728, Gotcha! I was about to go into a lot of questions about your comedy career but I will save it. Anything else you are watching?,10/3/2019 22:50
1485,1485," I've been watching the Medici which is another show produced by Netflix, it's really good as well. Mostly historically accurate, which is better than most.  ",7/22/2005 3:36
1485,1728," Sounds interesting. I watched a little of a viking show (not called viking but cannot remember what it was called) and that was ok. Im just not that into tv anymore, other than live sports.",12/26/2017 5:18
1485,1728," I don't watch a lot of TV either. I have it on in the background when I do homework mostly, and that's it. I do like seeing what movies Rotten Tomatoes has disliked lately. (But I hardly ever end up watching movies either)",8/31/1995 15:55
1485,1728, Sandler has 2 movies with a 0 rotten tomatoes score. Ha!,11/8/1982 19:36
1485,1485," lol yeah, and Spykids has a 93%.  Which is crazy. My kid loves that movie, but I just find it annoying. ",6/5/2010 1:21
1485,1485, It's that high!!!! 150 movies with 100% and I can't find one I like.,4/29/2002 3:16
1485,1485, They have some good music documentaries on there if you like that. ,6/17/1988 10:26
1485,1728, What would you recommend?,11/12/1987 1:10
1486,1486," There is one about the Eagles if you like that type of music, I enjoyed it a lot. I think there is one on there about Queen as well. ",12/24/1980 3:14
1486,1486, I'll check them out. Nice chatting with you!,9/22/2004 18:53
1486,1486," Voting is a method to elect their representative, it is the duty of every citizen to cast their vote and select their representative for the nation.",12/15/1981 0:19
1486,1486," Yea, India takes voting seriously, they set up a polling booth in a forrest with lions for one voter",10/7/2008 17:47
1486,499, Astronauts vote from space. It shows voting is very important to the nation. Voting is the biggest gift to people in the democratic nation.,6/21/1982 4:40
1486,499, It's a shame that 34% of the black male population have permanently  lost the right to vote,7/28/1973 11:06
1486,1486, It affects the entire democracy of the nation. Voting means people are also in the part of the government. People enjoy the vast power.,11/16/2016 3:55
1486,499," Yes, in the UK not all the men had the opportunity to vote until 1918",5/15/1984 21:51
1486,1486," But today, all people have voting rights. It is the power of the people. Ordinary people can change the government.",10/25/1980 7:13
1486,499," They have the right to vote but not a lot of choices, since 1853 all presidents have been either republican or democrat",1/13/2015 10:45
1487,1487, But people only choose the leader. In election campaigns all the party leaders canvas the people.,12/21/1997 0:54
1487,1487," Yea, I guess it's better than appointing officials by lottery like they did in Ancient Athens",11/2/2016 1:43
1487,1487, Nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates voting option for presidential elections. Election is the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.,8/12/2017 4:47
1487,890," Yea, it's a shame that voter turnout has breached 62.8% in  the past century",6/15/1972 18:50
1487,890, In 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states . It is very shameful to us. Real democracy is a transparent form of government. ,1/26/1996 20:53
1487,1487, Yea that is deplorable. It's strange that since 1900 the taller candidate has one the presidential election 75% of the time,1/1/2012 6:00
1487,890, It very crazy. Astrology can't work in guessing the election result.,2/13/1970 16:42
1487,1487, No I guess not. It's also peculiar that the only presidents with beards were republicans ,8/4/2019 10:18
1487,890, Republican party candidates have won most elections.,8/10/2011 15:06
1487,890, It's a shame that a Nixon or Bush has been on each winning Republican ticket since 1928,9/17/1999 19:02
1488,1488, Yeah. Vice nice chatting with you. Have a great day.,6/5/2010 11:50
1488,1513," Yea, you too, I'm gonna google some info about the Grand Ole Party",1/6/2002 8:20
1488,1513, Ok. The Republican Party is one of the major political parties in US. It was founded in 1854 they took anti-slavery and pro-economic reform ideological stances. ,7/30/2018 22:58
1488,1513," Well I got to go, have a nice night",11/30/1984 13:53
1488,1488," HEY, DO YOU WATCH nETFLIX?",12/23/2008 3:11
1488,1488, I love Netflix! Tell me something about Netflix,9/13/2019 19:09
1488,1488," It did something really awesome by signing Adam Sandler to a 4 movie deal in 2014, do you like Adam Sandler?",4/25/1994 1:48
1488,1513, I like some of his films. He probably will get a good following on Netflix. ,2/28/1984 9:20
1488,1513," yeah I love him too, I read it somehwere that he is gonna be doing a movie in which he is going to sing, can you imagine him singing?",11/25/1991 3:14
1488,1488, He did some silly songs on SNL I think. He is working with some topnotch actors. I think there should be some good films coming from him.,6/14/2008 12:01
1489,1558," Yeah I think he will be clowning around aping artists like Bruce Springsteen, lol, I would love to see that. really. ",1/13/2019 7:32
1489,1558, I think it's great that Netflix is willing to bank some films like these. The Hollywood system is broken. How did Netflix get started anyway?,9/25/1971 19:05
1489,1489," It starrted in 2012, but now its big and spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth. ",5/12/2017 0:13
1489,1489, I believe it. Bandwidth is getting cheaper. I heard the founder got pissed off about late fees or something. Blockbuster blew it!,12/6/2018 22:04
1489,1558," Yeah I know, that was insane, I wish Blockbuster had an eye in the future when it declined several offers to buy Netflix for $50 million because now Netflix is worth $2 billion. ",10/18/1977 3:17
1489,1558," Blockbuster was stuck in the past. They were thinking that people had time to drive around to stores. Computers, tablets, cell phones. I want convenience from companies!",7/26/1976 17:18
1489,1558," That is so true, Comfort is key in today's entertainment. ",9/16/2015 10:52
1489,1489, Quality is part of their success too. I've heard that Netflix has a ton of high quality films available. ,12/22/2001 4:17
1489,1489," yeah thats so tru, it has specials and movies staring awesome stars like Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo and Nick Nolte.",11/7/1986 18:25
1489,1558, I love those guys! I've heard Netflix has over 100 films that nabbed full marks on Rotten Tomatoes. ,3/26/1997 2:53
1490,1490," That is awesome to know, I know ratings mean a lot in the entertainment industry, but do you know more of how Rotten Tomatoes works?",3/13/2004 8:49
1490,518, I was started by some kids at UC Berkeley. The site aggregates reviews from professional reviewers.,3/3/2015 23:34
1490,1490," Ohh That's cool, Professional Reviewers that's where it gets the reputation I read somewhere that Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Warner Bros.",3/8/2015 16:17
1490,1490, I think Warner saw the chance  to promote its movies on the site.,11/11/1989 18:08
1490,518," Ohhh Now I get it, lol makes more sense when you put it like that. Do you play or like any video games?",3/12/1996 17:43
1490,518, Sometimes. Great chat! Thanks!,4/4/2007 11:17
1490,1490, Hi!  Did you ever play nintendo?,4/11/2013 6:23
1490,518, Oh yeah I did.  I still do.  One of the best gaming systems ever!,2/1/1991 5:16
1490,1490, Nice!  I can't believe they have been around over 100 years.  They were founded as a playing card company in 1889!,7/14/1980 22:12
1490,1490, How far they have come.  I think they made a wise choice focusing on video games.  Mario and Zelda made them billions,2/9/2009 5:27
1491,1704, Oh yeah!  Nintendo has a market value of over $85 billion dollars!,4/4/1992 22:16
1491,1491, They made enough money to buy the Seattle Mariners.,9/25/1993 21:51
1491,1491, Yes they did!  Because they own them there is a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat!,10/26/2003 2:43
1491,1704," Wow, you can play Pokemon and order a hot dog at the same time!",3/23/1984 2:08
1491,1704, Yes! lol ...and you can use the handheld console that Nintendo released in 2001 specifically for Pokemon. lol,5/28/1972 0:14
1491,1491, I think one of my favorites has to be Super Smash Brothers.  It is such a fun game and it is great to play at parties,3/22/2014 0:37
1491,1491, That game I think is the best game of all time.  Nintendo also produced a lego knock off when they were a toy company.  Interesting.,1/30/1995 11:45
1491,1704, A lot of companies have made lego knockoffs.  Never as good as the real thing.,2/15/1995 23:56
1491,1491, No.  lol  So do you like snakes?  I'm not a fan. ,6/5/1993 5:53
1491,1491," I am not afraid of them, but I would not have one as a pet.  ",2/9/1976 10:06
1492,1140, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.  H*** no!  Yikes!,12/23/1974 11:36
1492,1140, That is awesome.  Now that sounds like something you would see in a Mario Game,8/24/1999 12:45
1492,1140, Yes!  lol  I think I like New Zealand a whole lot better because there are no snakes there!,12/28/1985 6:42
1492,1140, Maybe because something bigger and scarier ate them all.  Think about that possibility.,3/22/1996 17:14
1492,1140, Yikes!  lol  The fear of snakes is hard wired not only in human brains but also in monkey brains.  I knew I always shared a lot in common with monkeys.  lol  I had fun chatting!,12/28/1991 12:53
1492,1492, Yeah me too.  Try not to worry too much about snakes,2/18/2002 15:07
1492,1492, I won't I promise! lol Have a great night!,4/25/1980 13:54
1492,1140," Netflix was founded in 1997, it's older than I thought. ",2/24/1998 22:33
1492,1492, I think it's amazing Blockbuster could have bought them ,5/16/1996 12:22
1492,1492, Especially considering that they're worth 2 billion dollars!,12/11/2006 12:10
1493,1493, It's also hilarious that they take up 33% of the bandwidth in NA during the evening.,12/14/1971 21:26
1493,1493, It's even funnier that it all started with a $40.00 late fee on Apollo 13.,9/28/1982 0:41
1493,736, So basically it's late fees on Apollo 13 that we have to blame for Adam Sandler's Netflix special.,6/16/1974 6:45
1493,1493," Haha, I think I've liked 1 or 2 things over his very long career!",4/5/2022 23:45
1493,1493," There a couple early movies I liked, but he deserves his recent string of Rotten Tomato losses, in my opinion!",8/7/2016 3:02
1493,1493, Agreed. His childish songs always drove me nuts. ,5/1/1974 3:50
1493,736, They usually are pretty terrible but I'd be curious about the Farley song; sometimes people surprise you when it's a sentimental issue for them.,12/28/1972 0:47
1493,736," I'm curious to see it as well, I'm sure I'll end up watching the special some late night.",6/6/1973 0:42
1493,1493," I probably will too, if just out of morbid curiosity.  To be fair I tend to like Netflix specials, so maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.",4/17/1977 20:27
1493,1493, It must be hard to be married to comedians and end up as subjects of their jokes and songs.,3/12/1986 2:24
1494,769," I don't know what would be worse, being the butt of their jokes and they're super successful and popular, or the butt of their jokes and they bomb.",6/4/1998 23:25
1494,1494," Definitely if they're bombing. Or no wait, if they're successful more people hear it.  Hmm, that's tough.",8/8/2003 6:49
1494,769," Probably the bombing.  If they're popular, at least they'll be getting specials and money and all that.  Maybe you can buy nice stuff with the sweet, sweet Netflix cash.",11/3/1978 16:56
1494,769," Ha, Netflix is rolling in cash. It's how they produce so many of their own shows.  Granted, some are pretty good.",6/19/2010 20:46
1494,1494," I've seen a ton of stuff from them that I've really, really enjoyed.  It's kind of cool to see what people can make when they are just handed a pile of money and let loose.",7/27/1983 18:49
1494,769, I so want that opportunity.  Someone needs to just throw money at me! :-),10/20/2011 2:34
1494,1494, Hahaha yeah!  I want to pitch them my comedic animated Korean drama monster cooking gourmet food after the apocalypse TV series!,1/29/2019 6:42
1494,1494, That sounds amazing! Totally would watch it. ,4/9/1999 16:57
1494,1494, Hahaha right?  I should go and write it up and submit it now.,10/26/2022 21:20
1494,1494, Do it. :-)    Nice chatting with you! ,4/16/2019 14:40
1495,1764, Nice chatting with you too!! Have a good one!,1/6/2022 17:13
1495,1764, You too. ,3/22/2003 18:56
1495,1764, Hello! So do you get into politics at all?,5/29/1983 7:25
1495,1764, i sometimes pay attention. it can be depressing. do you follow politics?,11/26/2011 15:33
1495,1764," I follow sometimes. I think it is pretty important these days to keep up on what is going on, but I am not outspoken like celeb's, Taylor Swift and Kanye.",6/3/1995 17:19
1495,1495, I distrust celebrities talking about politics. i dont think they know enough about the process and the issues. they are famous. thats it.,9/5/2012 7:40
1495,1495," I tend to agree but they are citizens but often go overboard. I guess if I had a following on instagram like Taylor Swift who cared what I had to say about politics, voting etc I would talk freely. I do feel we shouldn't be divided into, Republicans or Democrats though...we are all in this together. So do you vote in the presidential elections?",8/3/1993 14:25
1495,1495," I try to. I think it is important to vote, even if it might not seem to make a difference. I think the divisions are artificial and create polarization and conflict.",6/4/1970 3:38
1495,1764," I vote, but I completely understand your point. Sometimes I think the system is rigged anyway but I vote just so I can feel like I did my duty. I never have a side, I am not Republican or Democrat, just want to vote whoever is the best for our country.",9/5/2017 1:48
1495,1764, I figure that whoever gets in probably has been backed by moneyed interests. that is their first allegiance. ,4/7/2012 16:32
1496,1496, Exactly. I think voting should be changed somehow. But we all know it won't happen. Just like in 2012...in 9 states voters were blocked from the polls.,11/5/2010 12:19
1496,1496," How could that happen in the US? i feel like the country is going backwards. in Alabama, many black men cant vote. Isnt this a human right? we dont have enough people voting as it is.",3/10/1989 15:22
1496,1496," I agree 100%. We as a country seem to be going through some very crazy times right now and God only knows what will happen in our future. Not much makes sense. But for some Indians, their government set up a strange polling booth in a forest full of lions! ",4/13/2007 8:41
1496,308, I think there is an obligation there for the govt to reach out to the people and make sure that they can vote. I wish the polls were handled better in the US,6/21/2021 4:24
1496,308, I wish the same. The Government is supposed to be for the people....all the people. You don't see our Government caring about anything but what they see fit to deal with. It is ridiculous,11/1/2006 20:11
1496,1496," once the money gets in there, it distorts the process. there should be limits on contributions. that would limit the power of money.",11/28/1972 8:15
1496,1496, I agree! There is so much going on behind the scenes that we really have no idea what they really do. Even if they said no more huge contributions etc we the people would never know for sure. ,10/16/2019 6:52
1496,308," True, the money can move in many directions to buy favors. it is nefarious. most regular americans are not that greedy.",8/21/2019 23:24
1496,308, Agree again. It is all about the money and that is sad. ,5/27/1971 2:51
1496,308," Well, perhaps you can change some things at the local level. civic govt and such. or through NGOs. elections are hard to win, but maybe you can make change a different way.",3/25/2004 9:14
1497,591, True. Officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by a lottery....that's pretty interesting! ,6/5/1974 16:35
1497,591," I think that would help put new people in power, but maybe they would get bought. i would like to know that we get some help some of the time. Doesnt have to be all the time.",10/19/2005 13:26
1497,1497," Yep, true. Money is always going to be a problem in this country. Greed is evil and ruins everything. I just hope for future elections and for voting something changes and we can get to be back on track. It has been great chatting!",1/8/1991 16:19
1497,1497, I hope that people get the chance to make their voices heard. Great chat!,11/18/2019 7:41
1497,1497, bye!,9/9/1978 0:51
1497,591," Talk to you soon, I'm sure!",5/18/1993 22:31
1497,591, hope so!,10/28/1970 21:04
1497,1497, Do you play Nintendo games like Super Smash Bros?,3/8/1982 2:31
1497,1497, I do! I have a Switch at home and was excited for the game to come out. Do you play them?,4/14/2013 8:22
1497,1497, I used to with my kids.  Maybe I should pick it up again. I guess the new one had all the older characters?,8/2/1984 15:11
1498,660, I think so. They added a few new characters too,12/7/1983 5:56
1498,660, What is air dodging? Does that mean you can dodge stuff in midair? ,2/10/1988 1:47
1498,1498," Yeah, I was never very good at it. I'm still pretty old school and just button mash most of the time. I think they are making it to where you can only do it so many times in this new game. ",2/18/1974 5:12
1498,660, It seems like Nintendo really does listen to its customers.  They have always been a company that makes quality stuff.,3/9/2017 23:39
1498,660, They really are a great company. You know they you are getting quality when you buy something from them. They have a  market value of over $85 billion. Which is crazy. ,4/10/1982 23:53
1498,660, Wow.  I know their consoles survived my kids so that's something. Some people think the games made for them can sometimes be too technical.,12/13/1977 22:42
1498,1498," I can see that. I'm not a big gamer by any means, and sometimes the games are a bit much for me. I think though that they have to have some sort of balance so that the games are entertaining for all types of people. ",6/14/2000 5:29
1498,1498, They have a history with that having been founded in 1889 as a playing card company.  ,4/19/2017 18:36
1498,660," Yeah, and they made lego knock-offs which is kind of neat. ",5/15/1988 6:35
1498,660, You can tell you're doing OK when you own a MLB team. Nintendo owns the Mariners.,3/1/1986 13:37
1499,1499, Really? That's cool. I didn't know they did. ,1/19/1994 14:17
1499,1499, Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?  I wouldn't miss them too much.,1/12/1983 13:54
1499,1499," Really? I know there are no snakes in Ireland. A neat fact about snakes, the fear of them is hard-wired in human and monkey brains. ",1/5/1972 10:20
1499,1208," It's true for me I think.  I used to catch them as a kid but not now. Speaking of Nintendo, the original NES only displayed 54 colors.",10/13/2018 11:25
1499,1499," It wasn't discontinued until 2003 in Japan! I like the original, I wish I still had one. ",7/8/1993 7:29
1499,1499," Actually, me too. Maybe eBay?  I think it's funny the Bill Nye got his break my looking like Steve Martin.  Don't see it...",10/15/1997 8:18
1499,1208," There are a few places around where I live that sell them, they are just too expensive. Steve Martin? I really don't see it at all. But Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a role because he didn't look presidential.",8/28/1973 16:27
1499,1499, Funny for Reagan.  Thanks for the excellent chat!,4/1/2013 18:44
1499,1499, hey did you know that astronauts can vote when they are in outer space?,10/28/1974 16:59
1499,1208," Haha, I did not know that... How do they cast their ballot?  Do they have to submit an absentee ballot before going into space?",11/1/1975 20:04
1500,1500, haha good question! also crazy is that not all men could vote in the United Kingdom until 1918,10/7/2002 16:02
1500,1500, That is crazy!  Did you know that a dog beat two people in a mayoral election and served as mayor for 13 years?,11/21/2019 8:37
1500,303, no but that must mean the other choices were horrible haha would you vote for a dog?,2/28/2004 4:27
1500,303, I would vote for a dog in certain situations... ,7/26/2014 4:35
1500,1500," haha that is funny, also funny is how that Texas town renamed their garbage dump to the name Fred Durst",11/4/1980 21:40
1500,303," I'm not too familiar with Fred Durst, but he must be really disliked if they named a garbage dump after him, lol.  In relation to the dog being elected mayor, a cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election.",8/2/1978 19:43
1500,1500," ya hes a famous musician that most people don't like haha, do you know that republicans and democrat parties have only existed since about 1853?",11/4/2004 1:03
1500,1500," That's weird, I didn't know that.  I honestly wish we'd get rid of the parties.  There's lots of weird statistics in elections.  Since 1980, the faster blinker in presidential debates has lost every time.",3/29/2008 17:26
1500,303," wow that is weird, also I know that the taller president wins about 75% of the time",12/7/1982 20:36
1500,1500," I can understand that... I think when most people think of an ideal leader, the physical characteristics usually consist of being tall.  I can't explain it, but it's pretty typical to want a taller person than a short one to be a leader.  Another fun animal fact:  a chimp received 400,000 votes in a mayor election, but came in 3rd",9/6/1970 1:39
1501,1329," haha wow, well it is sad that voter turnout in the usa only gets to be about 63% at best",10/15/1976 16:47
1501,1329," Yeah, that's pretty crappy... do you usually always vote during elections?  I can see that number only getting lower.  It seems like the younger generation aren't as motivated to actually get out and vote, despite their vocal opinion on matters.",12/25/1979 1:29
1501,1329," right taht is a good point, and yes I voted, what is scary in the 2012 election is that international observers were blocked from attending teh polls in 9 states",6/3/1996 19:07
1501,1501, That's crazy... I'm sure there are a lot of special interest groups in foreign countries that would love to mettle with our elections.  Illegal immigrants trying to vote is also becoming an increasing problem in the United States.,6/27/2014 23:17
1501,1329," yes I agree with that, what I never realized too is taht every president who sported a beard has been a republican haha",4/6/2007 23:57
1501,1329, I like that the republicans and democrats play a baseball game every year.  The republicans are currently winning the series by three wins.  I'd like to see them play football against each other... ,4/5/1972 17:35
1501,1329," haha that would be interesting, also interesting is if they used different colors for republicans and democrats, red and blue only came into fashion in the year 2000",9/23/2005 18:50
1501,1501," That's weird, I figured red and blue had been around much longer than that.  As loved as JFK is, he actually voted against the Civil Rights Act in 1957.  Twitter would roast him if he were alive today.",6/13/2017 13:48
1501,1329," oh man, ya people would think very different about a lot of historical people, and yes we will see how they view Donald Trump 50 years from now",9/22/1971 6:59
1501,1501, Are you comfortable talking about the election and voting?,7/28/1979 10:01
1502,1502," ya we can do that, did you hear that a chimp literally got like 400k votes back in 1988 for mayor?",6/14/2000 7:49
1502,1502, Really? For mayor of which state?,2/12/2005 4:55
1502,1972," well it was for Rio De Janeiro, but unfortuantely or fortunately he came in 3rd place haha",7/14/1992 5:05
1502,1502, I guess that was their alternative to having a none of these candidates voting option,6/19/1971 0:20
1502,1972," haha good point, did you know that canada would only ahve 50 electoral votes if we took it over and made it a state?",10/15/2007 6:21
1502,1502, I did not. I wonder if it would be for better or worse if everyone had to vote like in the UK since 1918,4/12/1981 20:43
1502,1502," ya that is a good question, did you like JFK? I guess in 1957 he voted against the civil rights act",7/18/2000 16:18
1502,1972," That is a shame. I can't say I know enough to say I liked JFK, but I did think that he was vaguely among the more qualified people in the position of president so far. I wonder if there ever will be a 3rd party president",8/21/2018 18:05
1502,1972," that is a good quesiton, did you know that Hillary was a Republican back when she was in college?",5/6/1986 19:16
1502,1502, I wonder what made her change her affiliation? ,1/28/1998 9:02
1503,1503," thats a good question, did you know that Republicans and Dems do an annual baseball game? And republicans are up by 3 wins overall?",1/19/2001 8:30
1503,1503, I didn't. I did recently found out that every us president with a beard is a republican? Who knows maybe it is the invasion of the beard aliens,8/31/1970 20:54
1503,393, haha that is wild! imagine hillary with a beard,3/5/1989 21:37
1503,393," She must have fended off the beard aliens and joined the other side after. By the way did you know that the red and blue colors for republicans and democrats are relatively recently, only starting in 2000",5/28/2021 16:40
1503,393," no that is wild, also wild is that a us senator was arrested for civil disobedience, he was a repub. who was protesting apartheid",10/23/1977 15:21
1503,393," That is a shame. He had a good head on his shoulder, but too bad he was too progressive for his time",5/7/2017 5:54
1503,1503," yup I agree, also progressive was apparently Richard NIxon, he wanted to pass a guaranteed minium income bill",12/2/1987 20:05
1503,1503," I personally find nixon to be mixed. There are some controversy that his war on drugs may have been a war on race. Even today for instance, 34% of the black male population in alabama permanently can't vote and the prisons are very heavily populated with minority populations",8/22/2020 3:34
1503,393," ya I could see that, thats a valid argument, kind of crazy too that Ayn Rand who is a symbol for the tea party, was on social security and also medicare",1/6/1974 6:29
1503,393," Many historic figures are on the right side of some issues and the wrong side of others since what people perceive to be right and wrong is subjective and reflective of a diverse amalgamation of bias. In any case, this chat with you was enjoyable. I hope you have a wonderful day.",5/22/2021 9:21
1504,1463, Do you like Nintendo?,4/22/2018 18:39
1504,1463, I do like Nintendo. Do you?,7/20/2022 8:03
1504,1463, I like their graphics. The look and feel of Mario Brothers is nostalgic.,10/7/1992 4:36
1504,1504, I do love the look of that game. I really like the mario brothers franchise. ,10/26/1986 23:17
1504,1463," Yes, Pokemon and Zelda are good but nothing beats Mario Brothers. ",10/27/1985 4:27
1504,1463," Oooohhhh.... I do like the original legend of zelda. I wish they had that game for the ipad. I would play it so much! Well, I am now married with kids so maybe not...",4/16/1971 13:51
1504,1463," Yes, I was a little old for the Nintendo games but my kids were into the Pokemon cards and the Nintendo DS.",3/9/2016 3:51
1504,1463, I have a son that is into pokemon and his cards are everywhere. They have 750 episodes and I think I have seen them all! ,12/26/1981 2:15
1504,1504, I did not know the company started with the playing cards and even tried a knock off Lego before video game. ,3/5/1990 4:03
1504,1463, I think they found their niche! I could not imagine them doing legos or playing cards.,3/10/1983 13:50
1505,1505," Right, I would also love to play a little Nintendo on an iPad, maybe the racing game.",10/1/1977 18:07
1505,1505," Yeah, that would be great. Did you know they owned the mariners? I had no clue!",2/4/2007 12:22
1505,567, That is interesting. That must be why they have technology in the game stadium. Apparently you can order food to your seat from an app.,6/17/1995 14:50
1505,567," Yeah. Not sure I would trust seafood from a baseball stadium but if I did, it would be seatlle or baltimore.",8/4/2010 18:38
1505,567," Yes, Seattle is a great place to get fresh seafood like Salmon and Shrimp. I do not like all seafood especially those that are squirmy.",5/1/2017 19:44
1505,1505," Me neither but my wife has turned me on to some of the less adventurous items like shrimp and some sushi. I like the baked stuff, which people will judge me for eating but, whatever...",8/29/2014 16:57
1505,1505, Sushi is the best... except for the ones with octopus. I am against anything that reminds me of snakes. ,9/29/1986 22:32
1505,567, Right! I hate snakes. Might move to new zealand to escape them!,12/6/1983 12:47
1505,567, New Zealand is looking like a great place to live. No Snakes and the Hobbits live there.,2/10/1971 11:16
1505,567, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. I can't... NOPE!,8/9/2021 0:26
1506,1506, Launching Snakes is about the worst thing I have ever heard. I can't go to any place with launching snakes and crocodiles.,5/2/2017 13:34
1506,1506, Yup Nice chatting with you!,10/29/2011 10:37
1506,1506," Hello! I just got done reading about Stephen Colbert's explanation of God and information about Star Trek, did you read the same articles as me?",2/20/2017 9:39
1506,1506," Yeah, I have those articles. I think it's interesting that before 1963, students in the US read the Bible as part of the primary education.",12/31/1974 19:33
1506,1429," Crazy how things used to be, what did you think about Stephen's views on God?",7/24/1997 8:00
1506,1429, He seems to think that Jesus is God. He has a very Christian view.,6/27/2004 6:54
1506,1506," I agree, it's interesting to see a celebrity talk about their egregious views. The fact that he had Rev. James Martin on his show is also interesting to me, most show hosts try to avoid those topics. ",6/28/1986 9:01
1506,1429, I would like to read Jefferson's version of the Bible and see what he wanted people to read.,8/1/2000 4:17
1506,1429," True, it's weird to think there is a pop culture pastor out there in the world. Did you watch much of Star Trek growing up? I only watched some, I wonder if they ever mentioned the bible in that show.  ",2/14/1991 5:53
1506,1429, There were a couple of shows that mentioned Christian concepts. Generally the show was about morality. I didn't know that the Tower of Babel was based on a real building.,8/20/1999 21:27
1507,125," I didn't know that either. The factual section of these articles was the most interesting thing to me, especially the part where it says that Martin Luther King talked to Nichols about her role.  ",7/5/1973 2:04
1507,125," Nichelle Nichols was not certain about continuing the show, and he told her it was important for her to stay.",3/31/2009 15:16
1507,1507," I wonder how different things would be if she didn't stay, I'm glad he spoke to her about it and gave her advice. ",12/11/2012 2:52
1507,1507, Star Trek really changed how people viewed technology too. The flip phone was based on the communicator.,5/25/2019 5:42
1507,1507," Yeah I read about that too, I love that in modern day technology we were able to make something like that. Now we have something even better, smart phones, but still. I love how long Star Trek has been around for.  ",4/14/2021 1:01
1507,1507, So many people have appeared on the show. Tom Morello was on there twice.,3/4/2008 11:32
1507,1507," Yep! I like how they gave the fact about the door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope, I wonder what other weird sounds they used in that show. ",4/6/1977 3:52
1507,125, The sound FX folks had to be inventive. The teleportation device was created because of the tight budgets.,2/14/1986 16:51
1507,125, So cool. I wonder if Stephen Colbert ever watched Star Trek lol I'm sure he must have growing up.,1/4/1972 2:23
1507,1507, He was also a big fan of Lord of the Rings. ,3/16/1970 14:24
1508,1508," I love those movies! I wish they put some facts about lord of the rings in these articles, or maybe even in the celebrity section. ",9/9/1993 12:17
1508,241," Well, I've enjoyed chatting! Have a good day!",8/10/1988 16:57
1508,1508, Same to you! ,2/4/2017 6:18
1508,1508, Bye!,2/1/2000 6:26
1508,241, Are you familiar with Stephen Colbert?,2/8/1983 3:46
1508,241, just a little bit of the article i just read.  How does he start out with an explanation to god with broccoli?,9/25/1978 6:28
1508,241," It's a little bit odd. He says that if he holds a piece of broccoli, he wants his brain to be open to whether it will go up or down when dropped. He says that seeing God is similar.",3/10/1979 3:34
1508,1508, Well he's never read the bible i guess?  We should go back to 1963 and require children in school to read the bible,3/24/1996 16:41
1508,1508," He has read the Bible. He said one time when he was feeling spiritually lost, someone handed him a Bible. The page he opened to was one about worry, and he was feeling worried. So he believes that scripture can speak to you.",11/8/1989 4:09
1508,241, I know the scriptures can speak to you! I'd rather talk about star trek and how martin luther king Jr convinced the acotr to continue to play uhuru,12/3/1987 22:33
1509,1509, I used to love Star Trek. I find it interesting that teleportation was only used because their budget couldn't afford having spaceships land on planets.,5/21/2010 9:34
1509,938, Love the ingenuity!  Do you like rage against the machine?,5/26/2008 23:15
1509,1509," No, I don't really. I don't know much about them.",12/28/2013 7:03
1509,1509, i do! And tom morello from rage against the machine was a trekkie and was lucky enough to be the show twice,9/29/1992 21:57
1509,938," That's cool. Wait a second, I just realized that the star trek door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope. I have to listen more carefully next time.",8/19/1989 22:31
1509,938, see... again ingenuity.... LOVE IT!!!  How about the flipphone and now the apple watch... they were definitely ahead of their time!,8/12/1994 2:47
1509,1509, It's amazing that the flip phone was inspired by Star Trek,1/9/1975 23:08
1509,1509, yeah it is!  I loved the Next Generation.  You ever seen it?,6/14/2022 16:48
1509,938, That was always my favorite one.,2/17/1972 7:36
1509,1509, Loved the movies too.. i actually have the box set,12/2/2004 18:31
1510,427," How cool. I think there are some movies I still need to catch up on. I hope they create a new series one day. Star Trek was actually cancelled in 1969 because of poor ratings but when the reruns became popular, Paramount decided to expand the franchise.",10/16/1972 16:37
1510,1510, There are a bunch of spinoffs... i think there are like 5 different series after the original.  The recent movies are really good too!,7/25/2004 0:40
1510,1510, I'm glad they decided to go on beyond those first three seasons after which it was cancelled.,10/23/2014 21:39
1510,427, yeah mee too... many celebrities have come from the shows... look how it launched patric stewarts career!,3/8/1972 20:41
1510,427, I wish I was a celebrity. Then I could visit Pixar's secret room!,8/9/1986 22:11
1510,427," Are you religious, do you read the bible?",5/13/1991 3:44
1510,1510, I am but I do not read the bible. Are you? do you read the bible?,2/19/2021 3:55
1510,427," Im not religious but I have read some parts of it, for instance you know the tower of Babel?",3/24/1994 8:58
1510,427, I did not! What is it?,1/18/1982 23:17
1510,427," Well apparently the tower of Babel is real, its based on a real building. The bible is full of surprises for sure",6/20/2006 3:52
1511,1787," Prior to 1963, students in the us read the bible as part of their education. I do not think that would fly today.",8/15/1981 3:09
1511,1787," I agree, there are a lot of things in the bible that dont make sense and that science has proven wrong, ",3/30/2000 5:44
1511,1787, Roosevelt and Adams did not use a bible when they were sworn in? What did they use?,1/1/1976 15:09
1511,1787," No idea but I think they are the only two presidents to do things like that, Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible.",9/17/1975 22:40
1511,1511," If you do not believe, make your own truth! Seems like a logical thing to do...",6/19/1987 14:04
1511,1511," I agree, just razor cuts all the parts you dont agree with, he didnt believe in miracles and resurrection.",12/9/1973 18:17
1511,1511, He might have been famous enough to gain access to Pixar's secret room. I wonder what they got in there...,7/20/2005 0:14
1511,1787," I wonder that as well it must be a really cool room dough, I bet the cast of Star Trek has been in that room or at least the leading actors",11/3/2006 8:03
1511,1787," I want to see what's in there. What are they hiding. Unfortunately, I am not famous, like at all! Im barely on FaceBook so not many people know me.",1/9/1973 21:09
1511,1787," Yeah same here, I dont have many friends in Facebook either, I bet Robin Williams was invited to the room, he was the voice of Aladdin after all",6/23/1996 3:11
1512,1512, I thought he did a great job as the Genie. I think he also created a movement by having celebreties voice cartoons.,11/5/2021 14:41
1512,1512," He did start a trend, celebrities then started performing voices of cartoon characters, I wonder if Judge Judy ever did the voice of one!",2/11/2004 1:57
1512,52," She has no financial incentive to. She makes $123,000 per episode!",10/22/1970 16:02
1512,52," That is a lot of money! I guess she doesnt, it would be interesting though, maybe some day she will.",8/21/2001 15:32
1512,52, I wonder if she gets syndication money too?,5/1/2007 12:33
1512,52," I dont think she does although that is a great question, do you know who Carol Burnett is?",10/20/1977 23:24
1512,1512," I do, she's great. Nice chatting with you!",6/22/1976 5:09
1512,52," Hey how are you, what'd you think of Colbert's explanation of God?",8/1/2017 20:37
1512,52," Everyone has to be so politically correct these days!! He's on TV so they monitor everything these days!!  He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!",2/1/1993 19:56
1512,1512," Haha exactly, it's funny how upset people get about that and then they're totally cool with the whole history of the church and priests mistreating kids and what not.",3/11/1976 7:23
1513,111," Yes, in Hollywood or in Politics where its all coming out now! Not the rest of the country! ",5/10/1979 8:27
1513,111," For sure, it's so sad that people think that is okay. Have you ever read the bible",11/2/1972 12:58
1513,1513," True, Yes, I have and believe in God!! Its interesting that Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible!",12/17/2017 6:42
1513,1513, It would be cool to read that bible too. To each their own! It's crazy that it was still required to read the bible in public schools until 1963.,10/10/1972 6:51
1513,1513," Yes, public schools had a bible class. Its hard to have an opinion unless you've read it and understand. It would be interesting to see the tower of Babel!!",7/15/1980 21:58
1513,1513," That would be really cool to see in Iraq, I've been there but didn't see anything biblical lol. It was a pretty cool place though, unfortunately it's been so destroyed by war.",8/4/1995 22:09
1513,111, Really that's interesting!! Scary place now! lol the Star trek door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope.,12/9/2019 10:48
1513,111," I just had to reenact that sound just now lol, it would be hard to come up with those effects back in 1966 when it started! Did you like the show?",11/29/2022 14:24
1513,111, I watched when I was a little girl on TV. Ahead of its time for sure!!,6/28/2015 14:45
1513,1513," Oh wow, I bet that color TV blew your mind? Or was it black and white still? I'm not sure when TV came out in color, hopefully no offense lol. ",8/2/2005 9:34
1514,1514," No thats funny. It came out color in the 50's, Star trek was in the 60 and 70's.  Captain Kurt and Spock were pretty cool! lol I see Uhuru the actor was convinced by Martin Luther King to stay on the show! lol",5/10/2009 6:57
1514,1527," I would have never of guessed that, I'm sure it was a difficult situation to be in for sure. Guess how much Judge Judy makes an episode?",8/21/1992 8:15
1514,1527, I heard alot!! I think shes the highest paid only after Lebron James!!,3/17/2001 2:48
1514,1514," For sure, $123,000 an episode, I'd be happy with just doing one episode. I wonder how she rose to fame like that. ",8/28/2012 15:52
1514,1514," Connections probably, personality and talent.  I wonder what that secret room Pixar studios looks like?",3/31/1987 14:42
1514,1514," I know right, I wonder what is so special about it? I don't know if I would want to be a celebrity or not, seems like too much work and stress lol.",11/2/2012 15:12
1514,1514, No never. You just don't get to the top easy! There is too many people with talent. Makes you wonder what they have had to do to get to the top!! I loved Robin Williams he always made me laugh. Its a horror how he died!! so sad!!,2/25/1998 8:30
1514,1527," For sure, wish it was acceptable for more people to seek help instead of thinking that suicide is the answer. Great chatting, hope you have a great rest of the night. Take care!",9/26/2004 23:10
1514,1514," How's it going, do you like soundtracks, they are released with movies, books, and tv shows",1/13/2020 9:04
1514,1514," I like some soundtracks but only whe they are catchy songs. Alicia Keys was on the Men in Black soundtrack and wrote her own song for it, at age 16",11/19/1989 11:14
1515,1515," Nice, Alicia Keys is real talented. I never knew Spielberg actually played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack",5/10/2007 5:59
1515,1444, Have you played Sonic 3? Michael Jackson helped on that soundtrack.,4/20/1994 9:02
1515,1515," Yea, I never knew MJ did that soundtrack. Have you ever listened to the O brother, Where art Thou? soundtrack? It went platinum 8 times",2/20/1987 10:31
1515,1444, I have not. Seems like I shoudl check it out! People need to be careful not to put plot spoilers in soundtracks. There were big plot spoilers in Phanton Menace from the soundtrack weeks before the movie was released.,3/31/1985 20:06
1515,1444," Lol that's unfortunate. The Batman Begins soundtrack doesn't have any, all the songs are named after bats",5/7/1987 15:45
1515,1515, How about rebellious soundtracks? Race Against The Machine's contribution in the Godzilla soundtrack actually criticized the film itself,4/14/2017 22:10
1515,1515," Lol I can't blame them, it was a bad film. I heard Daft Punk did a good job doing the Tron Legacy soundtrack",8/9/1998 10:31
1515,1515," Has Taylor Swift been in any soundtracks, I wonder?",9/7/2010 8:11
1515,1444," I'm sure, Swift has been a singer since she was 14",3/21/2016 17:05
1515,1515, Yeah she was the youngest person to single handedly write and perform a number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. She has a lot of talent.,7/13/2001 2:44
1516,1516," Yes, and her second Album Fearless was the best selling album in 2009",12/12/1973 23:25
1516,1516, It's crazy that she moved to Nashvill at age 14 to pursue a career in country music.,1/23/2010 4:48
1516,1516," She became so successful, she's able to top itunes just by accidentally releasing 8 seconds of white noise",10/2/1976 22:39
1516,1183, That is hilarious. I remember her debut album. I think it was adorable. It spent most weekson the chart in the 2000s. I think it's interesting how she has evolved from being a country singer to mostly a pop singer.,2/20/1971 0:59
1516,1183," Yea, It's unfortunate Swift removed all her music from Spotify though",11/18/1976 8:21
1516,1183, Oh yeah? Why is that?,8/15/1972 1:44
1516,1183," Swift said she does not thing music should not be free, kinda disrespectful to her fans",5/15/2017 8:08
1516,1183, She doesn't like her photo being taken either so she walks backwards. Wonder if this is just to paparazzi or also fans.,4/2/2007 22:31
1516,1516," That's kinda rude. Well I gotta go, nice chatting with you",5/4/2015 18:48
1516,1183, Do you like Steven Spielberg?  Did you know he played the clarinet on the soundtrack for Jaws?,6/2/1989 18:42
1517,1190, That's pretty neat! I didn't know that. ,12/28/2010 22:59
1517,1517," Phil Collins seems to be well versed in languages.  He did recordings of tarzan in english, italian, german, spanish, and french",4/29/2011 7:45
1517,1190," Wow. That's cool! The soundtrack for O brother, where art thou went platinum 8 times!",10/20/2018 20:18
1517,1517," I never even heard of that.  But interestingly, each track of batman is named after a different genus or family of bats.  Weird..",5/27/1978 21:26
1517,1190, That is weird! Do you like Taylor Swift?,4/4/1991 23:18
1517,1190," She is okay.  Apparently, she owns a dassault falcon private jet worth $40 million and an airport hangar in Nashville international airport.  I guess she does a lot of travel!",1/15/2018 9:31
1517,1517, Wow! Pretty cool. I didn't realize she was from Pennsylvania.,1/24/1993 20:16
1517,1190," Yes,indeed.  She doesn't have music on Spotify though because she doesn't feel music should be free",7/15/2018 18:42
1517,1517," She probably doesn't have to, she makes tons selling it!",10/19/1975 22:00
1517,1190, She doesn't like her photo taken either and walks backwards to avoid having it taken.,6/4/2003 13:31
1518,1518, That's kind of bizarre. She was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year at the Grammy's ,7/13/1991 11:47
1518,1518," Do you like reading?  If you were in the 18th century and liked it, you may have been confronted with your parents scolding you due to moral panic.",2/3/1979 15:23
1518,1518, Haha. Too funny! There is a lady that can read 4700 words a minute!,10/8/1976 2:46
1518,1518, I wonder how fast Tolkien and Lewis could read?  They used to read bad poetry together and have you laugh you lose competitions.,1/6/1977 6:16
1518,1518, That must have been funny! Did you read Enders Game? ,3/27/1978 13:00
1518,837, No I didn't.  That was suggested to military groups including the US Marine Corps.  Did you read it?,6/13/2001 20:02
1518,837," I heard that too. No, I haven't. Starship Troopers is on the military reading list, too. ",5/12/2012 22:40
1518,837, Did you hear of Daft Punk?  They negotiated their Tron legacy soundtrack over a pancake breakfast wearing their trademark robot helmets.,11/17/1971 1:41
1518,1518, I've heard of them but never listened. That's pretty funny!,3/23/1982 18:17
1518,837, Nice talking to you!  Have a nice day!,12/23/2011 21:23
1519,667, Hello! How are you today?,6/26/2022 13:15
1519,667," Hi, I'm fine. What do you know about Parliamentary governments?",4/24/2004 22:55
1519,1519," Hardly anything lol, how about you? I know a Prime Minister is the head of the cabinent.",2/1/1985 15:54
1519,667, Yes they are not head of state. I live in Canada so I am very familiar our system is remarkably similar to the British system as well as other commonwealth countries.,6/29/1973 2:39
1519,1519, That is interesting! Do you know much about the US government?,3/25/2000 17:09
1519,1519," Yes I do. Lots of bad stuff too, like how they passed legislation to protect government employees who violate the geneva convention. Not sure how that will work with international law..",6/6/2012 0:25
1519,1519," I didn't even know they did that and I'm from the states! I feel like they make exemptions for just about everything. They even had plans on how to destroy wikileaks, which wikileaks leaked haha.",10/24/1985 11:31
1519,1519, I remember that being in the news. Of course Wikileaks is till doing fine to this day.,10/16/2021 12:51
1519,1519," I remember when they first came into the light everybody was up in arms, but yes you're right, they are still around going strong. Did you hear about the man that impersonated a government official?",8/12/2015 6:29
1519,667," Lots of people impersonate government officials, can you be more specific?",1/1/1999 17:08
1520,777," He managed to sell the eiffel tower not once, but twice!",12/31/1973 13:17
1520,1520, Wow. No I haven't heard about that. I don't really know much about France other then they have a prime minster.,5/3/2019 16:17
1520,1520, Same here. Do you remember in 1995 when a radio station prank called the queen by pretending they were Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien?,3/1/2003 10:02
1520,1520, Yes not sure how they got away with that. It was actually considered offensive to imitate Jean Chretien's peach impediment. The radio guy got fired and probably lost his shirt after that.,8/7/1998 21:35
1520,777, Lost his shirt huh? I wonder if he wore polo shirts?,2/16/1981 10:18
1520,777," He went broke. Who would hire him after that? Polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player, it was only later polo players started wearing them.",11/22/1985 5:10
1520,777, I agree! Weren't they created by Rene the crocodile Lacoste? Now the brand makes sense!,1/2/1988 3:44
1520,777, You're right. When I was a kid I always called those shirts alligator shirts. I had no idea it was actually a croc.,4/3/2014 2:19
1520,777, Same here. I need to move to Hawaii because I like their sense of business attire over the rest of the country's!,1/9/2005 13:03
1520,777, Aloha shirts? I've never wore one before. They're just so flashy.,10/2/1970 5:45
1521,1521," Super comfortable though haha. Anyways, it was nice chatting with you! Have a great day!",1/16/2008 14:08
1521,952," hello,  do you like movie soundtracks?  I recently learned that steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtracks.  Thats pretty amazing. ",4/10/1995 21:47
1521,1521, Yes I enjoy soundtracks very much. One of the first I heard was the one from the movie Legend with Tom Cruise.,3/27/1979 18:35
1521,1521," oh I dont think I ever watched it,  any good?",7/6/1975 0:36
1521,1521, It's a great fantasy movie about evil and good with unicorns and the devil in it. I would be a good book but I'm not sure if it was made into a book for reading.,9/17/1973 21:35
1521,1521, Have you ever seen the movie O Brother Where Art Thou?,2/19/1997 5:59
1521,952," Yes, and I heard the soundtrack for it has won many awards, although I can't remember more than one song from it off the top of my head.",1/9/1976 10:04
1521,952," Haha I dont really remember any song from it,  but I remember the movie,  it was good. ",8/9/2016 17:12
1521,1521, I think it had some goofy scenes and so probably the soundtrack was a little goofy but also professional sounding so I guess it was attractive from it's uniqueness?,7/5/1996 16:09
1521,1521, yeah and the fact the movie symbolized that book The Odyessy by Homer. ,11/29/2003 5:15
1522,282, I'm not sure if I remember that or not. Was that the story about the ugly outsider and the hero who killed monsters? I'd love to hear a soundtrack for that!,3/5/1981 5:51
1522,282," i read it in High school,  I just remember the actual book was about a man on a very long journey and the obstacles he had to overcome. ",7/10/1980 17:40
1522,282," Sounds really interesting! I heard the soundtrack for Tron Legacy was negotiated over breakfast where robot helmets were worn. How did they eat, though? lol",10/29/1982 23:24
1522,1522, haha that sounds awesome!,6/1/2001 11:29
1522,1522, The soundtrack for Batman Begins movie sounds really cool. I guess each song has the scientific name of a bat.,2/18/1992 4:00
1522,282," I found that extremely interesting,  how creative!  I definitely have to take a look at those tracks. ",3/25/1972 12:58
1522,1522, The movie Jaws soundtrack is another one that is interesting. Did you know Steven Spielberg himself plays the clarinet in it? He's got talents!,3/21/2020 8:49
1522,282, yeah that was the first thing I said haha.  Definitely amazing.  ,11/1/2002 18:07
1522,282, I wonder if he has played that or any other instrument in other soundtracks? I bet Taylor Swift's music as been in at least one movie soundtrack...,7/1/1984 16:15
1522,282," Im sure she has,  she is very popular and has a lot of hit songs.  Did you know Taylor swift walks backward to avoid having her photo taken?",3/7/2020 13:14
1523,1658," Wow that sounds like really hard work, though! Poor girl! I think I'd try holding up a newspaper to pretend like I was reading. She recently took her music off of Spotify. She's becoming a rare commodity!",7/22/2003 17:59
1523,1658, Maybe she just doesnt have a good contract with spotify lol ,11/15/1977 21:43
1523,1523," Yes, or perhaps some parts of the contract weren't read correctly. She's bound to be ok making money from concerts and soundtracks if she wants, I am sure.",3/4/2001 15:54
1523,1658, What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?,12/14/1997 0:58
1523,1658," I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?",2/4/1984 16:16
1523,1658, Lol nice intro,5/21/2013 1:24
1523,1658," Thanks. Maybe I could get a job with Steven Spielberg... He can play the clarinet like he did for the soundtrack of Jaws, and I can pretend to be talented.  What do you think?",6/19/2021 1:39
1523,1658, I always like it when the director or producer directly plays a part like stan lee,5/17/1981 22:32
1523,1523," Yeah, or M. Night Shamalan (spelling?). I alsolike it when celebrities mock themselves, like Kanye West did on SNL. Although Taylor Swift may not have enjoyed that...",11/1/1984 19:19
1523,1658, True. I agree,8/12/2019 19:23
1524,876," You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music...",3/11/1985 15:18
1524,1524, I guess it is all about the brand,10/15/1983 7:40
1524,876, Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?,7/20/1978 0:38
1524,876, No. I genuinely think paparazzi are jerks,3/25/1984 23:33
1524,876," Agreed.  Still, it would be nice to have her $40 mil jet and personal airport hanger in Nashville. Right?",10/23/1979 23:29
1524,876, True True,1/31/1980 2:24
1524,876," Let change the subject to something more profound and significant... Haave you ever read Starship Troopers...after all, it is on the reading list of 3 of the 5 military branches, so it's gotta be good, right??",2/11/2004 23:13
1524,876, I have read it as well as Ender's game. Both great books,6/5/1984 6:50
1524,876, Did you experience a Moral Panic from those novels like so many did in the 18th century upon reading novels?,2/19/1971 17:43
1524,876, Lol of course not,5/3/2005 19:36
1525,1525," I would love to attend one of those You laugh, you lose contests made famous by CS Lewis and Tolkien. I could end up being the biggest loser!",2/1/2004 20:33
1525,1525, Indeed. It would be really fun to watch. Kind of like harmon's quest,6/13/2022 4:03
1525,1525," Oh, and it would be really lovely if they speed-read their horrible poetry out loud! I don't know if they could achieve the record 4700 words per minute laike Anne Jones, but it would be fun watching them try!",9/12/1992 14:43
1525,1525, Indeed. Anyway thanks for chatting.,8/5/2003 20:26
1525,1525, Hi there!,11/28/2008 9:44
1525,102, Hello. Have you ever heard of Reddit?,12/7/1994 23:30
1525,1525," Yes, I have..I browse it on occasion, but had no clue as to some of the backstory surrounding the site. Very interesting! Do you use the site yourself?",10/5/1995 2:45
1525,1525, I don't go on the site itself much but I love reading the screenshots that people post to FB and pinterest. I think I would spend entirely too much time if I went on the site. ,6/14/1991 19:50
1525,1525, Agreed. It's one of those sites that's best used to pass the time reading something random while on the train! I find it interesting that Snoop and Jared Leto were involved in the funding of the company. ,11/18/2004 21:47
1525,1525, Not a bad investment with the way that it is growing in popularity. I think after tumblr had all their issues people were more inclined to go to reddit. ,10/19/2019 10:16
1526,972," true. It's always great to hear different opinions, and Reddit helps give those opinions a voice. Speaking of opinions, did you catch the state of the union speech yesterday? I'm always baffled by the whole ceremony involved in making it a big discussion! Some weird laws being passed around the world, wouldn't you say?",12/13/1979 7:41
1526,972, Government the world over is just strange in my opinion. Politicians are less concerned with the people they represent and more with their own agendas. The balance is being lost. ,8/30/1976 23:11
1526,972, I couldn't agree more. It's like somewhere along the way the whole 'doing what is right' obligation of public office has been washed away and instead we have converging agendas and strong opinions taking the place of compromise and common sense.,10/23/1975 6:16
1526,972, In my opinion common sense does seem to be sorely lacking in today's political climate. We are almost bordering on tyranny from both sides of the aisle. Neither is willing to compromise and those that suffer don't have a say. ,9/22/1971 2:34
1526,972, It's a shame really. Because compromise could lead to some really long-lasting and positive improvements for society. I always look back to the years following WW2 as a prime example. Things just got done back then. Wonder if all this technology has something to do with it.,5/22/2022 17:21
1526,972, I think back then tech had a lot to do with it. I think nowdays though tech is compromising the moral fiber of the nation. People have instant access to all their vices and unlimited access as well. ,4/3/1989 20:58
1526,1526," Not to mention the lack of privacy. everything is posted instantly, quotes can be clipped and taken out of context with ease, prime example being wiki leaks!",3/15/1983 8:03
1526,1526, I love that they had access to the fact their own government was conspiring against them. Shows how far our government has fallen. ,8/18/1991 17:18
1526,972, Ha! Very much something out of a doom and gloomy sci-fi movie. It also makes you wonder what else is concealed in those endless files and folders. What's the deal with the government owning nearly all the land in Nevada? ,8/27/2008 1:01
1526,972, Who knows. Probably some testing facilities that we don't know about. I think their enforcement of stat authority is overriding our individual freedoms. ,4/1/2010 1:30
1527,1515, Could be. the only thing I could think of is that used to be testing ground for nukes. maybe that's the only way they avoid a slew of radiation-related lawsuits! Hmm...I wonder if they pay property tax to the state!,9/1/1986 8:52
1527,1515, Probably not. Now if only they would take all the money they are wasting on whatever they are doing there and follow Norway's example of conservation and save some trees. ,11/24/1998 7:19
1527,1515, Conservation-focused spending is never as splashy as building a shiny new wall. Unfortunately we tend to deviate over to what is not needed rather than what is. I think it was last week they discovered a gaping whole in a glacier that is the size of Manhattan? Norway is doing the right thing and we should follow suit. There's tons of land that we should put trees on.,3/15/2004 22:00
1527,1515, So true. All of these polar storms we are getting are the direct result of poor conservation. People hear global warming and get so hyper focused on the warm temps not thinking that yes it is getting warmer at the poles and driving the polar vortex down and throwing off natural balances. ,3/1/2007 22:28
1527,1527, It was absolutely crazy here last week. Never seen it that cold before. Thankfully most people stayed indoors that day / called in sick.,8/24/1989 11:41
1527,1515, It is getting to be a yearly thing here. I am concerned for when it starts being more than just a few days of those temperatures. That could have serious economical impacts. ,12/12/1972 23:57
1527,1527, Did you know that Facebook and Twitter work together on some issues?  They are actually competitors.,8/24/2005 10:04
1527,1515," No, I didn't know that. What kind of issues do they work together on?",4/29/1973 22:38
1527,1527, The baby sitter-rating system broke the social networks' rules.,8/15/2000 1:02
1527,1515, I think I heard about that now that you mention it.  Was the about Predictim?,8/7/1988 7:39
1528,1410, Predictim is a company who does the analysis regarding babysitters' online histories on Facebook and Twitter.,10/19/1971 23:10
1528,1410," Yep, it was the one using advanced artificial intelligence.",3/18/2012 22:15
1528,1410, Facebook is also investigating Predictim because this company performs scraping of personal data.,10/3/2003 9:58
1528,1410," Yep, they could provide false information that could affect people's lives.",5/16/2005 6:47
1528,1410, They violated Facebook's rules.,2/7/2003 13:18
1528,1410, Yes they did.  So I guess by violating both facebook and twitter rules that's why they worked together?,4/20/2003 5:05
1528,1410," Yes, you are right.  Twitter will stop their access to certain site tools.",10/1/2022 22:51
1528,1528, That's good.  What that company was doing seems really wrong.  Getting private information and selling it?,8/12/2022 9:17
1528,1528, I also think Facebook and Twitter should have tools to prevent situations like that.,7/30/1997 9:21
1528,1410," I agree totally.  There might be some countries where they do.  Not everything on those sites are the same everywhere. For example, in a state in germany the like button on facebook is illegal.",12/2/2019 7:39
1529,817, Twitter and Facebook should have anticipated things like that to happen.  They can afford the technology.  About Germany:  what is the like button illegal?,9/6/2017 20:40
1529,1529," I don't know exactly.  It's just that one state, I think it's Schlewsig-Holstein, that has made it illegal so it's not there for them.",5/17/1981 8:54
1529,1529, Can you guess the reason why they did that (making the like button illegal)?,6/18/1992 1:22
1529,817," Actually no. I could see making the angry button illegal but not the like.  As I think about it, maybe they think it encourages people to flirt too much?",7/19/1979 14:10
1529,1529, Probably but your explanation is funny.  Did you hear about Burger King's promotion related to Facebook?,6/19/1981 23:27
1529,817, No I didn't. What's it about?,11/29/1974 14:11
1529,817," If you unfriend 10 people on Facebook, you can get a free whopper.  Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you!",6/30/2015 7:10
1529,817, Oh man I am low on dragon energy.  You?,10/4/1995 10:44
1529,1529, Here too.  Maybe we should both eat a few big macs!!,11/25/2014 21:55
1529,817, Big Macs are ok.  The quarter pounder with bacon and cheese is good.  Filet-O-Fish is one of he best things on the planet.,6/9/2022 17:34
1530,1530, So..the Trumpster seems to like his fast foods!!  That explains that belly.  lol,2/23/1994 3:29
1530,1530," Yes.  Michelle Obama tried to motivate kids to exercise, eat right.  Trump is more of a french fries are my friends kind of guy.  Salad bad.",5/30/1979 8:02
1530,273," Well I guess as long as Trump is here, those gaseous cows will still be making burgers?",4/15/2000 5:18
1530,273, Gassy cows?  I see that Kanye West has been talking about his MAGA hat again.  A special hat that gives powers.  ,8/30/2005 10:40
1530,273, Do you know I haven't seen on yet outside of TV?  Gonna have to get me one and see if I feel like superwoman since he feels like superman!!,4/25/1989 0:03
1530,273," I do not know anyone who would wear one.  It might be nice to have, stick in the back of a closet, bring out for the kids.  Once, there was a orange man int he white house.  He brought us many many changes.  He was a hero to reporters and rappers alike.",3/31/2011 0:39
1530,1530, Korean rappers call rap compliment battle.  Gonna have to check that out.,2/22/2004 15:13
1530,273," So, the hat makes Kanye feel like superman.  A comic book hero.  I wonder if he would get the irony.  I wonder if the irony was in a rap song would it hit more.",11/20/1994 15:01
1530,1530," If you could understand the words.  I have trouble with that.  IN sweden it is illegal to name children metallica, superman, veranda, ikea and elvis..  Wonder why?",4/28/2015 18:20
1530,273," If your name was superwoman, and you were young child, it might make you.... a lot more likely to jump off a building.  The problem with my middle name of Ikea is mostly meatballs.",11/10/1973 9:16
1531,1531, Maybe.  Didn't think of that.  Only $130.  paid for exclusives to superman in 1938.,7/7/2003 23:32
1531,1531, 1938.  that seems like a dated concept.  What does a modern super hero look like.  Are there any new comic book heroes?,9/18/2007 20:19
1531,1531, Hmmm. Another one for google  ,6/10/1971 14:04
1531,681," I often wonder what kind of lessons can we learn from some one that predates computers and the internet.  Brainiac was the made up name of a villain,  not a smart person.",6/25/2011 21:04
1531,1531, There's probably many lessons out there.  He is a good guy in supergirl!!,2/19/1990 23:10
1531,1531," Does supergirl TV show still run? Superman once wielded Thors hammer.  Not because he was super, but because he is fictional. ",1/31/1970 3:41
1531,681, Not sure.  Would black panther be considered a newer superhero?,1/28/1981 20:41
1531,1531, No.  Black Panther hero pre dates the black power group. So long.,7/31/2013 5:11
1531,681, Do you use facebook?,1/4/1990 10:10
1531,681, Yea but I don't like how facebook is being used for surveillance like with the company that would look at babysitters' facebook profiles,4/22/2017 12:37
1532,1532," yikes, that is kind of scary. I know they do a lot of stuff with our data, not good. I wonder how myspace would have ran it",3/12/1998 2:04
1532,1532, I don't know I'd imagine it would be similar to how companies intrude on the babysitter's data despite facebook banning it,3/30/2017 3:57
1532,1532," wow, I am sure there are rules around that unfortunately. It is kind of like a german state banning the like button",4/13/1994 10:48
1532,709," Possibly, I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook ends up going to court over it since some lawyers argue it is legal to snoop on people's profiles",10/27/1995 14:43
1532,1532, Or in front of Congress again. They need to figure that out and stick by their word,5/19/2010 5:11
1532,1532," Yea, I don't like how advertisers use facebook, like with the Burger King promotion that offered a free whopper to unfriend 10 people",1/28/1976 1:29
1532,709," I kind of liked that lol, free whopper for deleting friends I don't need. lol",5/30/1981 11:56
1532,709," I don't know, sounds like a very mean spirited promotion that Burger King was pulling",4/10/1971 3:06
1532,1532," true, I wonder what their reasoning was. Kind of hurting facebook's business. Maybe they were mad at the data breach",4/3/1974 14:32
1532,709, I don't know but it is concerning that Iceland is using facebook to rewrite parts of its constitution with all the data issues and trolls,1/11/2011 6:37
1533,1533, That is pretty cool. Power to the people! I am sure they hear some crazy things. What do you think of it?,7/17/1999 10:49
1533,649," I have no clue, I could only imagine the trainwreck it would be if the US tried using facebook to rewrite the constitution",11/11/2019 15:24
1533,1533," yea, it would be a huge trainwreck. Seems like trump is using twitter to rewrite it, lol. Kidding",6/18/1971 0:54
1533,649,  did you there are no snakes in New Zealand?,12/6/2011 9:26
1533,1533," lol, I need to move there for both of those reasons lol! Snakes are crazy, do you like them?",7/8/1976 3:23
1533,649," Yea I find snakes pretty cool and fascinating, I guess I'm not one of the humans with the fear of snakes hardwired into my brain",11/21/1975 0:04
1533,1533," I am one of those, but they are so interesting to say the least. There are flying snakes too!",4/2/1992 3:21
1533,1533," That's pretty cool, I know there are legless lizards that are often confused for snakes",6/23/1973 19:04
1533,1533," I wonder what the difference is. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!",6/10/1982 18:09
1533,649, Do you like horses? ,3/25/1993 5:10
1534,1534, I do like horses. Did you know that horses are ticklish?,6/29/1982 20:06
1534,968," No, I didn't know that. Like super ticklish? ",1/25/2007 13:18
1534,1534," Yes, along with sharks and  orangutans. How's that for a weird animal fact?",3/13/1987 2:51
1534,968, It is pretty weird. Did you know CLint Eastwood is allergic to horses? ,10/15/1988 21:43
1534,968, No kidding! And he did movies that I can remember him being on horses. I wonder how he did it?,4/8/1991 5:50
1534,1534, I'm not sure. Maybe he took claritin? ,1/22/1975 14:43
1534,1534, Haha. Maybe! Did you know that an individual horse has a peak horsepower of 14.9 horsepower.,1/27/2011 12:58
1534,968, I can see that. And did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed? ,1/2/2013 5:47
1534,968, They do? I wonder what that's all about?,1/11/1979 19:07
1534,1534," It is for speed walking, a tolt. ",3/24/2004 5:33
1535,1535," Oh, okay that makes perfect sense.",7/27/1976 13:14
1535,558, Do you use reddit? ,10/19/2001 11:42
1535,558, I have in the past. I know the co-founder of reddit has a cat named Karma. I think that's cute.,3/10/2003 8:01
1535,1535, Interesting. Did you know the first comments was a complaint? ,11/13/1996 22:56
1535,558, Are you serious? Why am I not surprised by that? I know now there are posts organized by subject into user created subreddits.,7/7/2021 12:23
1535,1535," Yeah, that is pretty funny. Only 0.53% of the people actually participate that visit. ",11/29/2009 3:16
1535,558," Yeah, I could see that happening. I know it is ranked as the #3 most visited website in the US.",10/22/1982 9:18
1535,558, WOW! Really? I didn't know that. That is great. Nice chatting with you. ,7/21/1984 10:05
1535,558," Yes, and its #6 ranked worldwide. I'll have to get back on. Have a good night! Nice chatting!",3/26/1993 7:21

1536,1536, SO cool. Do you know how much of the land in Nevada the government owns?,6/22/1979 13:22
1536,7, Yes they own about 86% of it but most of it is desert anyways,11/30/1970 12:53
1536,7, True. Do you know of that guy that sold the Eiffel tower twice?,11/10/2022 1:07
1536,1536, Yes he was good at impersonating city officials it seems,6/14/2016 23:14
1536,1536, Yeah. Did you know how the Norwegians are saving the Amazon?,7/26/1973 17:44
1536,7," Yes they donated $1 billion, that is a whole lot of money",9/22/2020 17:27
1536,7, Yeah I know. The US now has a law that protects its employees from the geneva convention violations,6/16/1985 15:52
1537,1537," THat does not sounds right. On another topic, do you like horses?",1/4/2020 0:16

1538,1588," Hey how is it going, do you have a facebook account?",12/13/2016 16:16
1538,1588," I do, although I use instagram more. What about you?",8/23/2005 2:13
1538,1538," I do have an instagram account, no facebook. I can't believe MYspace turned down an offer to buy facebook in 2005.",1/7/1982 22:51

1538,1538," The actress from the Good Place? I did not know that, when did she do that?",11/18/1982 1:24
1539,1539," I am not sure, although I never did think that an actress would decide to write a non fiction piece.",1/11/1998 4:13
1539,1539," For sure for sure, that is pretty nuts, google plus hangouts has a lot of AI too.",5/31/2022 6:25
1539,1539," Speaking of  google plus hangouts, Stanford's free AI class uses it to  help teach!",12/9/1990 12:03
1539,1539," Oh wow, did you see the 2048 game the AI played, scored almost 1 million points.",12/1/1995 8:43
1539,608," Wow! That is a lot of points. Now, AlphaGo, an AI, has managed to beat the worlds best GO player!",3/19/1995 17:12
1539,608, Crazy. Did you know there are zero snakes in New Zealand?,10/5/2000 22:34
1539,608, That is very odd.  Crocodiles are also slightly related to birds!,11/16/2005 1:50
1539,1539," I bet, they are probably both like dinosaurs right?",12/4/2017 19:52
1539,608," Probably, they are closer related to birds than snakes are to lizards.",12/30/1996 20:16
1539,608," I could definitely see that, those legless lizards that are lizards without limbs but still not snakes, those are weird.",11/23/2014 10:05
1540,1540, There are also a genus of flying snakes that launch themselves at prey.,8/8/2022 0:37
1540,1540," Oh wow, I am going to take off for the night though, have a good one. Take Care.",6/27/2018 1:26
1540,340, You too! Have a nice evening!,10/4/1993 9:05
1540,1540," For sure, take care. Hopefeully it submits after this message!",12/23/1987 5:39
1540,1540, do you know much about the government?,6/4/1994 4:36
1540,1540, I know that the word censorship is censored in CHina,12/16/1995 8:26
1540,340, Wow that is ironic. DO you know what wikileaks is?,1/7/1986 22:42
1540,340, Is that the website that reveals secrets?,7/20/2000 22:51
1540,1540, Yes and they once revealed documents that showed how they were trying to destroy them,10/22/2018 23:01
1540,340, Wow that is so cool. DO you use Reddit?,5/5/2021 2:57
1541,201, I use it sometimes. Do you ever vote in the content there?,10/25/2009 22:47
1541,201," Not really, do you? DO you know who made the first post there?",1/27/1970 9:05
1541,1541, I do not know that but I know that less than 1 % of people vote ,1/6/1985 4:39
1541,1541, WOw that is low. THe first post was by the co founder Ohanian,12/19/2000 4:54
1541,1541, Nice. They have a page with the kindest 25 deeds done,5/7/1984 8:42
1541,1541, Nice. Have you heard of code reddit?,2/8/1970 2:11
1541,1541," I have not heard of that, what is it in reference to?",12/21/2001 9:03
1541,201, things appear as c#code when they are associated with that ,11/14/1982 17:59
1541,201, I see that sound pretty cool. DO you know the first comment on Reddit?,2/20/1977 23:58
1541,1541, I have no idea. Do you know what Reddit stands for?,8/17/1989 18:55
1542,142," Hmm good questions and I have no idea , what is it?",9/21/1986 11:39
1542,142," It is read/edit and read it, makes for reddit",9/15/2021 20:18
1542,1542, I see that makes sense. THere is a free magazine called the Redditor,11/20/1977 10:44
1542,1542," Cool, they are expanding. Nice chat",4/18/2001 23:16
1542,142," Same here, have a good one",8/20/2000 6:14
1542,142," Hi! You don't by any chance still use Myspace, do you?",1/12/2020 13:47
1542,142," no, but I use FAcebook, and you?",2/24/1977 5:28
1542,142," I use Facebook also. It's really lasted, unlike Myspace. That's why it's so crazy that Myspace chose to NOT buy Facebook in '05 for $75 million.",6/1/1991 19:31
1542,1542," What I was looking is that FAcebook is based in Menlo Park Ca. same place where Thomas Edison used to live. Curious, eh?",8/29/1990 4:09
1542,142," There's a huge tech boom in California, so that makes sense. What's even more curious is that a German state banned the like button. How do they enforce that?!",11/23/1995 21:58
1543,1486," haaha I don´t know, I was thinking in that, and it sounds kinda stupid, isn´t it?  I didn´t know that you have to be at least 13 years old to be able to be a registered user.",8/30/2014 6:59
1543,1543," Oh, yeah, on most sites they want you to be at least 13 years old - but again, do they really do anything to weed out under-aged users? You just have to CLAIM to be 13 years old!",2/4/2012 11:53
1543,1543," yes, that is right and dangerous. I was  astonished that Iceland is rewriting their constitution via facebook, that is cool, because everybody can contribute to change the law and update it.",11/6/1999 16:53
1543,1543," Yes but then even 13 year olds can make contributions! But I guess as long as the changes/suggestions make sense, who cares how old the person is who made the suggestion?",10/30/2019 2:09
1543,1543," Yes, you are completely right, hahaha, I haven´t noticed that I could had gotten a free whopper, I had unfriended at least 10 people on Facebook, lol",9/14/1978 17:29
1543,1543," Oh yeah, Burger King had that promotion. Pretty soon, a lot of BK's workers are going to be come redundant with the advance of AI technology.",6/25/2019 3:08
1543,1486," Yes, that is something that really makes me worried for the human being. I get it, is something that is going to happen, and we are contributing to that, but, I hope our grandkids still can get a good job.",11/5/1973 18:16
1543,1486," Like, even Stanford is using google plus hangouts to augment their teaching. How soon before professors become unnecessary?",12/21/1972 23:08
1543,1486," Yes, you are right. I wonder, what careers would be able to continue working? , well, I didn´t know that FAcebook is developing an AI designed to understand user emotions, predict user actions, I wonder if this is going to help to stop the mass shootings?",12/26/2008 11:28
1543,1486," Hmm, interesting question. Hopefully it can track users who exhibit suspicious activity. Maybe Kristen Stewart knows? Apparently she wrote a paper on AI, but I don't know when, why, or with whom.",7/16/1999 18:15
1544,886, I don´t know either. Do you like snakes? any type of snake?,7/1/1993 13:59
1544,886, I've never really had any interactions with snakes so I guess not.,9/11/2010 4:05
1544,1544," Hahaaha, me neither. Well, I am surprised that crocodiles are closer related to birds than snakes and lizards, I don´t think they resemble a bird, cool",7/28/2017 10:11
1544,886," Birds are also the closest living relatives to dinosaurs, which is pretty cool, too. You would think it would be reptiles, but no",10/18/2021 2:41
1544,1544," Yes, love dynosaurs, I am giving you an excellent, thanks for the conversation!",5/23/1992 2:12
1544,886," You, too. Thanks!",4/5/1977 0:10
1544,1544, Have a nice day!,10/29/2000 0:35
1544,886," Have a nice day...oh, and if you don't like snakes, consider a move to New Zealand. Them kiwis don't have any snakes there!",5/19/1971 8:43
1544,886," hahahahahaa, ok, going there, to New Zealand!",12/2/1994 4:32
1544,886," Cool, I may see you there :)",6/19/1998 6:17
1545,1545, Yes!,12/17/1980 21:40
1545,1545, Unless AI develops too quickly and robots kill us all before that can happen :(,1/23/2010 18:11
1545,257, Did you hear about Kanye and Trump having a meeting?,6/19/1977 19:55
1545,257," yeah, think that was while back when trump had kanye to the white house",4/24/1983 17:00
1545,257," Yeah, it was in October.  I wonder what prompted something like that?",5/16/2010 9:43
1545,257," Seems like kanye was there praising Trump for prison reform or something, I don't recall",10/9/2002 10:45
1545,1545, Kanye even wore a MAGA hat.  I would have thought he was on the other side politically.,3/28/2010 19:05
1545,257," yeah, Kanye took a lot of flack for being a trump supporter",5/22/2006 11:58
1545,257, That happens now.  People judge you based on political affiliation.,4/22/1978 20:58
1545,1545, yeah seems like the divide gets wider every day.,9/12/1978 21:01
1546,1546, I think it does because people cant stop to see the other side.  I can disagree with you without being hateful.  ,3/18/1982 21:31
1546,766," yeah, I feel the same. no need to be hateful because someone sees things differently. Sadly, today, it seems like if you dont think a certain way, you're not only criticized but can be threatened with violence. Crazy times for sure",2/2/1984 11:20
1546,1546," It really is.  On another topic, do you follow the super heroes much?",9/3/1973 7:13
1546,1546," A little, didnt know there was a coin with super man on one side in canada",8/4/1999 6:53
1546,766, Really?  Thats kinda cool.  In Sweden you cant name your kid superman.  Im not sure why you would want to but its against the law.,12/18/1973 15:02
1546,1546," meet my kid, superman. Ha! poor kid. How about the soviet union version of superman. Do you think he drinks alcohol?",7/12/1976 11:53
1546,766, Who doesnt drink vodka... lol.  Probably did.,6/4/2008 3:54
1546,1546," yeah, orange juice is boring without a little vodka. soviet superman coulda been a big hit as a series.",1/15/2002 3:54
1546,1546, I wonder if he would get to wield Thor's hammer?,8/21/1974 23:56
1546,1546, he could invite Thor over for a drink wield his hammer and whatever else of Thor's he wanted to.,3/23/1993 20:32
1547,1950, He is considered worthy.  ,7/2/1990 21:39
1547,1950, did you know that jimmy carter installed solar panels on the white house and reagan removed them?,9/27/1979 0:29
1547,1950," Yeah, then George W Bush had them put back on.  I wonder why they were removed?",5/16/1972 10:52
1547,1547, didnt know GW had them put back,11/15/2005 4:32
1547,1950," Yeah.  Id love some solar panels, cut that bill.  Its been great chatting.  Have a nice day!",7/31/2019 1:10
1547,1547, Have you heard the Eminem/MGK diss tracks? ,9/29/1983 20:55
1547,1950," No, but I have heard of NoClue, the fastest English rapper.",3/26/1975 5:09
1547,1547," I haven't heard of him, when was he around? The 80's or 90's? ",11/26/1973 1:35
1547,1547," I can't recall, but he raps at a rate of 14.1 Syllables per second!",3/23/2000 0:54
1547,1950," Thats crazy! There is this rapper from Chicago, Twista, who can rap really fast too! ",12/8/2017 17:41
1548,1548, Oooh!! Tell me more! Did you know McDonald's was paying rappers $5 for ever mention of Big Macs in their songs? ,7/7/1974 9:13
1548,1548, He was on some song a few years ago with Kanye West. So if i mentioned Big Macs in my song i get $5? That would be great if it was for every time the song played. ,1/2/2014 1:42
1548,1548," Yeah, that Kanye is something! He hugged the president on his visit. I didn't know you could hug the president! I wonder too if the $5 was everytime the song played or just when the song came out. ",7/2/2007 10:36
1548,156, Kanye West is a character. I wonder if he is really like that without the cameras around him. ,2/11/2016 15:09
1548,156, Did you catch that bit about Kanye referring to himself as Ye now?,3/25/1998 3:33
1548,1548, Yes i did! It seems to be something different with him everyday. I guess it does shorten his autograph a bit. ,8/19/2010 19:21
1548,1548, It is speculated that Ye and Trump have hit it off so well because they both like to be in the spotlight. I'm in the mood to chat about Superman.,1/1/1998 16:55
1548,156, Sure! Seems like a good deal to purchase the right to SM for $130! ,8/5/1995 6:26
1548,1548, Oh! Do tell...I don't know about this. Did you know there was a Superman version for the Soviet Union?,9/29/2021 23:16
1548,1548," DC comics bought the right back in 1938. Still seems like a bad deal. No, was he still called superman? ",8/31/1989 11:58
1549,51," Very interesting facts you have there! Yes, he was still called Superman but he was raised in the Soviet Union. There's also a coin in Canada that has Superman on the heads side. ",8/21/2012 14:37
1549,1549, Thats crazy! Do you know why Canada has him on the coin? ,2/5/2000 11:36
1549,1549," No, I sure don't, but the coin is silver and is legal tender. Neil Degrasse once appeared in one of the comics ",10/21/1999 9:05
1549,1549, Thats great! I love Neil! Was it just a cameo? ,6/18/2020 19:46
1549,51, He helped Superman find his home planet.,10/25/1971 1:07
1549,51, haha thats amazing! Have a great Day! ,7/10/2010 8:04
1549,1549," But wait! There is more. Superman didn't originally fly. He was made to fly by Fleisher Studios, because they found his jump scenes too difficult to animate.",6/23/2002 18:58
1549,1549, Thats Great! ,8/9/1990 23:12
1549,1549, Hello.  Have you ever read any Dr. Seuss books?  One of my favorites is How the Grinch Stole Christmas.,6/23/1974 14:45
1549,51, I like Green eggs and ham.,6/4/1995 23:55
1550,333, That is a good one.  Did you know that Dr. Seuss worked for the Army in World War 2?,11/21/1979 11:42
1550,1550, I did not. He was voted least likely to succeed. They do not have an eye for talent...,9/22/1997 16:54
1550,333," Evidently.  He worked in the animation and film department for the army writing, producing, and animating productions for them.  He even won an academy award for one in 1947.",10/25/1982 23:05
1550,1550, I did not know that. I didn't know he was afraid of children either!,10/22/1980 0:54
1550,333, Was he really?  Why was he afraid of children?,6/6/2021 2:37
1550,333, Because of their unpredictability. I wonder if he ultimately had any kids...,4/10/2007 23:29
1550,1550, I don't know.  It's interesting that children scared him and yet he wrote such wonderful books for them.,1/13/1979 19:38
1550,333, He was one of the first persons to use the word nerd.It was first used in the book If I Ran the Zoo.,1/7/1997 10:52
1550,1550, I didn't know that. I guess due to his books I always assumed he was this squeaky clean parental sort but he actually was drinking during prohibition and got caught.,12/6/1993 1:36
1550,333," I blame him for getting caught, not the drinking part. I mean what else would you have done back then?",10/25/2000 1:17
1551,1427, Well he was a determined young man because he took up the pen name Seuss so he could keep on writing after that.,8/31/1977 13:29
1551,1427, Good for him! I would have given up. I wrote for a few years and it was a lonely experience...,11/23/1974 20:15
1551,1427, I wonder if it was for him. He wrote over 60 books.,5/1/1996 20:05
1551,1551, That's a lot of books. I hope it was lucaritive for him.,6/1/1988 16:52
1551,1551," I imagine it was. His books had 11 television specials made from them and even a broadway musical, not to mention the movies and tv series.",8/27/1974 23:15
1551,1551, I can't believe Dartmouth gives out honorary phds. Seems like something non-ivy league schools would do.,3/26/1985 7:18
1551,1551, Well the man did graduate from Oxford after all.,2/25/1989 14:37
1551,1551, He lived for a really long time too. 1904-1991! I had no idea he was around that long.,6/19/1988 11:23
1551,1427, I had no idea he had done so much other than write children's books.,6/15/1990 15:26
1551,1551, Hello! How are you today?,11/11/1988 17:26
1552,52," Hi! I'm good, thanks.Just listening to some music on Spotify. You?",2/26/1990 13:39
1552,52, What are you listening to? Is spotify ran through the internet?,4/28/1979 20:58
1552,52, It is! I was listening to some Florence and the Machine. I prefer listening plugged into a desktop than using the app. My service isn't the best on my phone - but at I bet it's better than what you get at the top of Mount Everest,3/5/2004 0:00
1552,52, I'm still surprised you get 3g at the top of Mount Everest! Maybe to post selfies I'm sure.,8/25/2019 2:41
1552,1552," I mean, if I could ever make it to the top I would definitely call everyone I love (and everyone I hate) to tell them!",12/18/2021 5:37
1552,52, Haha you and me both. I think the internet has come a long way. It even helped introduce KPop to everybody!,3/7/2000 11:57
1552,52," Speaking of, I know that it's intensely popular but I really don't know anything about it other than that it's mostly dominated by boy bands, right?",10/15/2011 3:43
1552,1552, Basically. I know North Korea has its own Kpop girl band though!,10/8/2001 22:25
1552,1552," Yeah, they're the most popular group there. But I bet the government has a hand in controlling what the people listen to, so it probably doesn't mean much",9/8/2003 11:26
1552,52, North Korea? No not all all! Just kidding I'm sure too haha. I can't believe they mold these boy band members in bootcamps!,5/10/2013 11:10
1553,1085," That actually sounds a lot like what they did to sex workers in London in the 18th century. Charged them for their clothes, their rooms, everything, so they always had a debt to pay back and were never free",4/9/1971 6:43
1553,1085, Dang that is harsh! Even Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band!,10/22/1974 9:59
1553,1085," He actively manages them? What, acting wasn't lucrative enough for him?",9/10/2000 20:42
1553,1085," I guess he needs to diversify all his money lol. Speaking of crazy, do you know the us military uses xbox 360 controllers for their EOD robots?",3/17/2022 18:59
1553,1085, I don't even know what an EOD robot is! But you're saying they use xbox controllers to control military robots?!,3/13/2021 14:38
1553,1553, Pretty much! They are bomb disposal robots so they are there for the greater good haha.,7/7/1970 16:27
1553,1553, I guess that's the best kind of robot imaginable. But now all I can think about is someone in fatigues lying on a couch moving their thumbs to dispose of a bomb lol,11/9/1990 10:01
1553,1085, Haha that's the same picture I get as well haha. I want the ones that can debone chicken for you!,3/19/2009 16:38
1553,1085, That would really solve all of my chicken problems. I have pounds and pounds of bony chickens and no one (or no THING) to de-bone them! You can't even see the floor at my place. Nothing but chicken and bone.,8/27/1972 17:30
1553,1553, Oh man this would help for sure! Well it was nice chatting with you have a great night!,3/19/2006 1:59
1554,1554, Good afternoon!,12/11/2016 13:03
1554,1554, Good afternoon to you!,11/2/1994 13:55
1554,1554, What's on your mind today?,10/21/1977 16:06
1554,1989, Just read an article about the Lorax. Have you hear of that show?,9/16/2021 1:33
1554,1554," No! I've never heard of it. But it's based on the book by Dr. Seuss, I'm assuming.",7/3/1989 23:27
1554,1989, it is. A group of professors are trying to see if is based on a real story.,12/7/1991 23:07
1554,1989," What? That's insane. Dr. Seuss was an interesting person though. He was afraid of children, yet some of the most popular children's books of all time. ",4/17/2005 9:17
1554,1989," Wow, I did not know that. My favorite  is The Cat in the Hat.",12/22/2012 11:09
1554,1989," Crazy, right? He's not even a doctor technically, it's just a pen name he had to use when he was caught out drinking during the prohibition era. I think my favorite is Green Eggs and Ham.",1/22/1973 20:41
1554,1554, He served as one of nine army playwrights during ww2,12/1/1983 11:17
1555,1555," He's definitely lived an interesting life, I couldn't imagine living one just as exciting. Publishing one book would be crazy, but imagine publishing over 60? What a career.",3/10/2011 3:53
1555,1966, The first use of the word nerd was in his book.,5/1/2009 17:23
1555,1966, That's fascinating. Do you know any other fun facts about him?,4/13/2022 22:16
1555,1966," He wrote a screenplay called the 5,000 fingers, people started walking out after just 15 mins.",8/12/2006 3:03
1555,1555," That sounds terrifying, oh my goodness. This has been a fun conversation.",7/17/1972 2:56
1555,1555, Yes it has. I hope you have a great day.,5/1/2002 11:54
1555,1555, It'll be much better now that I got to learn so much about Dr. Seuss from you!,9/8/1971 20:37
1555,1555, It's always cool to learn new things.,6/24/1993 6:05
1555,1555," I totally agree, sometimes new topics can be so interesting. I hope you have a lovely day!",12/10/1998 23:18
1555,1555, I hope you do as well.,2/3/2020 6:17
1556,1141, Thank you!,10/7/2022 21:13
1556,1141, Hi friend! What do you enjoy doing with your free time these days?,2/16/2001 19:04
1556,1141," I am usually resting, working out or on the internet! and you?",12/7/2007 17:41
1556,1556," Me too, although its hard to rest for me these days I have twins, they keep going and going haha I spend a lot of time on the internet. ",11/26/2019 19:00
1556,1141," I bet with twins.  I have a boy and girl, but they are 22 months apart and that's a lot of work!!  Having twins must be so exciting though! So adorable!!",11/29/2018 12:43
1556,1556," Yes, they truly are. I love it! Thank goodness for the internet although did you know that all the clicks and sounds can cause a real addiction! ",11/25/2022 0:48
1556,1556," lol, I have heard that too! Clicking those links. ",9/23/1988 23:58
1556,1141," Yes, although we can find a wealth of information. Im a researcher at heart always looking for something new to learn. Like I just learned about the garlic girls have you heard of them?",11/11/1975 16:28
1556,1141," Yes, I was wondering about that, do you know what Olympic curling is?",8/14/1986 16:52
1556,1556, Ive seen it a couple times but I dont really understand it. But I watched the garlic girls they are amazing! by the way they prefer to be called the Team Kim do you know why?,10/13/1990 21:28
1557,1557," No why? So when you watched it, what were the garlic girls doing?",4/16/2013 7:56
1557,342," due to a common sur name in south korea. All of their last name is Kim. So all of them nicknamed themselves after their fav things such as pancakes, cookies, etc. so cute! I caught a 2 min video, just waxing the floor to make the ball go further, i liked their spirit",9/27/2001 9:43
1557,1557," Oh ok, that makes sense! That's funny!! Have you heard of this K-pop?  The North Korean played a song, Hit your heart when they sank a South Korean warship in 2010. Good thing they are getting along better now!!",6/13/1989 7:36
1557,1557," Yes! my older daughter introduced me to them, they are obsessed with K pop and BTS (a boy band in case u havent heard) their songs are catchy",7/15/2005 17:39
1557,342," Really, North Korea has a band called Moranbong band, lol it suppose to be the most popular in their country! ",3/15/2015 4:02
1557,1557, Thats an interesting name! Its crazy the feud of these 2 countries north and south korea! in 2010 south korea responded by blasting a k-pop song when north korea sank a southern warship! they are creative at least fighting with songs lol,8/3/2017 9:30
1557,1557, At least they are in a peaceful mode at this time. How do you feel about robots? do you have any? Like the vacuum cleaner? lol,9/28/2000 20:54
1557,342, well... I dont mind having a robot that could help me clean... just the thought that eventually it can be aware of itself and start a war like conspiracies have it lol Im not sure what i believe yet but i could use a helper around the house clean after these twins!,4/18/2008 23:42
1557,342," That's what I was thinking with the twins. I saw a video of a cat riding one of those vacuum cleaners for fun around the house, helps with liter clean up! I have also seen a video of 3 vacuums going round and round with halloween brooms attached for decorations. So funny!!",4/20/2006 3:37
1557,342," Lol, I can definitely see robots becoming very useful allies, I just dont trust the people in power and how they could be used. Also it would be cool to see how the giant robot michael jackson wanted to let roam in the dessert would of been a cool sight to see",1/22/1999 18:12
1558,1871," Can you imagine looking out your hotel window in Las Vegas and seeing that 50ft robot roaming around!! ha, ha ha!!",8/15/1980 3:44
1558,1871," He would make history once again! He was amazing. Anyway, it was fun chatting with you! sending you light and love. Take care!",7/21/2006 10:28
1558,1871," Hi, how are you?",11/19/1980 11:10
1558,1871," Hello, what hobbies do you enjoy?",7/27/1980 2:43
1558,1558," I like to watch sports, drink fine whiskeys and workout. You?",1/17/1995 5:10
1558,1871, I agree and I also enjoy surfing the internet or learning about robots,1/10/2022 10:43
1558,1558, Nice! what have you learned about robots?,6/27/1982 14:48
1558,1871, Well did you know the us military uses xbox 360 controllers to control their eod robots? Perhaps games are a conspiracy to raise the next generation of remote robot pilots.,6/11/2015 11:28
1558,1558, Wow! Probably because all of their operators played the games growing up so it was only natural!,10/10/1976 4:09
1558,1558, Now robots can debone a chicken with surgical precision and efforts are being made so that surgeons can do surgery remotely,12/5/2006 3:43
1559,1161," WHAT! That's crazy! I want one. The deboning robot, not the surgery one. That would be great.",2/8/1993 21:43
1559,1161, A more creepier thing is that robots can be controlled using rat brains and the robot will change personality based on the brain. Kind of like the rick and morty episode where rick turns himself into a pickle,5/20/1974 12:48
1559,1161, I just got into Rick and Morty but am only on episode 2. But rat brains is pretty creepy.,3/13/2005 23:12
1559,1161," Oh then you will eventually see the episode I am referring too. I would say it was well written and while it may be a bit disgusting, very intriguing as well",10/10/2022 4:59
1559,1161," Overall, do you like the show? I want to get into it but haven't gotten excited about it yet.",5/22/2008 18:56
1559,1559, Well personally I liked it. Games of Thrones actually took me longer to get into,5/5/1977 15:40
1559,1559, I got into GoT right away. I will try to keep on watching it. A lot of my friends love the show so I want to understand their jokes. What other shows do you enjoy?,9/27/1972 3:40
1559,1161, Well lately I have been watching more shows over the internet such as revisiting old ones like south park or watching final space,3/14/1990 12:36
1559,1161, Final Space? I have not heard of that. What is it about?,1/14/2005 15:34
1559,1559," It is a recent cartoon follow-up that deals with a prisoner in space. Pretty humorous though. Many voice actors and people in rick and morty were in it. If you want to look up more info, the internet, with its vast information network, would be an invaluable resource.",2/2/1971 10:26
1560,1595, I will have to use that resource to look it up. I may even use the hamburger button!,9/6/2009 14:53
1560,1595, Talking about the hamburger button kinda makes me wanna eat a burger with curly fries,10/13/2010 2:27
1560,1560, Me too! Nice chatting with you!,3/9/2005 16:18
1560,1595," hi, do you know Dr. Seuss?",1/18/1983 8:31
1560,1595," Oh yeah, loved his books as a kid.  Seems we have many Loraxes and Once-lers these days.",2/13/2006 15:09
1560,1595, did you know he was voted least likely to succeed by his classmates?,1/9/1973 21:42
1560,1560," Yeah, they really had to eat their judgement. Can you believe his work is also being in scientific studies by Dartmouth?",2/9/1978 3:41
1560,1595, that is something. did you know he was afraid of children too?,10/4/1996 4:40
1560,1595," Yep, but children weren't afraid of him.  His books were always checked out. The word nerd was his creation?",5/23/2013 21:39
1560,1595, He has done so much through his work. He was technically a doctor too cause he has a phd from Dartmouth.,4/15/1973 1:36
1561,1561, Yes and he did it all without computers.  He might have though the water powered computer the Russians made in 1936 was cool. ,3/28/1988 1:13
1561,1561, Yeah that one is actually pretty cool. did you know the space shuttle comouter run on 1 mb of ram,12/26/2008 1:46
1561,1561," Yeah, the shuttle actually had 3 of them for redundancy. Speaking of space, in 2010 the UN appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials. Funny huh?",10/1/2001 11:45
1561,1561, Hahha just in case they ever appear and want to communicate with us.,11/21/2020 17:26
1561,1561, My first question would be: Why did you cross all those light years just for Earth?  You'll not find us environmentally friendly and here's a copy of the Lorax.,9/20/1983 9:37
1561,1561, hahhahaha. Did tyou know the days were much shorter when earth was formed?,7/4/2003 10:33
1561,1561," Yep, I wonder if that's with or without the moon... As humans, we would account for only 1 min and 17 sec of a 24-hour period.  We are newbies. ",8/23/2012 11:15
1561,1561, That is insane. Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?,3/16/2017 9:19
1561,1861," So much for those shiny silver balloons... Q: If the Lorax represents environmentalists, what are the Brown Bar-ba-loots?",8/9/1984 21:41
1561,1861," I am actually not sure. Sadly though, we have deforested more than 80$ of the earth",1/24/1979 20:34
1562,1562, It is sad but environmentalists sometimes are loony.  Like Apple voiding the warranty of their computers for smoking near it because they think it makes it a biohazard. ,8/14/2015 11:46
1562,72, Yeah that is kind of strange. Did you know transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers?,3/15/1979 17:49
1562,72," Yeah, I would be interested in how much different space people would need.",12/22/1994 13:05
1562,1562, I guess we'll have to wait and see. nice chatting with you,7/25/1983 7:02
1562,72," Hey there, do you vote during elections?",3/8/2015 8:58
1562,1562," Yes, I always vote. How about you?",12/16/2009 6:55
1562,1562, Me too. There is a voter in India that lives with lions and they set a poll just for him to vote.,9/27/2009 0:04
1562,1562, What kind of lions live in India? Had you heard of that before? That one voter?  Did you know it is required by law in Australia that everyone must vote? I think we should have that.,11/8/2011 17:16
1562,1562, Yea I think we should really. I mean even astronauts vote from space. Why can't we here?,1/29/2014 11:32
1562,1562," Do you think more women vote, or more men?  Why do women vote against their own interests?",6/8/1978 8:17
1563,1315," i do not know. strange enough though, not all men were allowed to vote in the uk until 1918. I wonder how you made the cut to vote",1/16/2003 0:56
1563,1315," My guess would be that it had to be property owning me or literate men, but that is just from our own country's history that makes me guess that. ",9/18/2009 11:16
1563,1315, that is actually a very good idea. sadly 34% of the black population in alabama has lost the right to vote. I wonder if that has to do with felony laws,12/18/1970 18:44
1563,1315," Yes, it does have to do with felony laws.  After emancipation, southern states set out on a purposeful campaign to reenslave black people using all sorts of new laws that put them in jail and put them to work.  a heinous system in this country.   Totally racist.",5/11/1997 17:30
1563,1563, I know cannot believe it is the 21st century and we are still this closed minded. ,9/20/1970 22:37
1563,1563," I agree with you, man.",12/8/2006 12:36
1563,1563," In Austin, on the other hand, people went out and voted on renaming their garbage dump after Fred Durst.",12/30/1977 12:15
1563,1563, That's pretty weird,9/18/1972 11:05
1563,1315, I know so strange. Have you ever visited the white house?,2/26/1974 11:18
1563,1563," I went by the outside of it, but couldn't go in. What about you?",9/29/2008 8:21
1564,1564, Yeah me too just from the outside. It has twin buildings in other countries as well.,8/22/2016 12:52
1564,499, Have you been to those other White Houses?  Where are they? ,2/17/2015 7:12
1564,499, they are in ireland and france. wonder if the presidents live in those too,5/26/1989 1:31
1564,1564," No, I don't think their presidents live in those white houses or someone would have mentioned it to me.  ",2/8/1981 4:48
1564,499, Yeah same here. Some people go there every year when they reveal the christmas tree.,5/10/1990 14:12
1564,499," ok, bye now",8/24/2005 6:18
1564,1564, bye,2/25/1998 3:20
1564,499, Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that. ,12/21/2018 17:47
1564,1564, It is strange to think about. I think it is irresponsible not to vote in this day and age. It is a hard fought right and we should take advantage fo that. ,3/3/1976 4:31
1564,499," I agree. I was always encouraged to vote. However, i do think that Tina Fey was unfair saying that white college educated women turned the election and now want to go back to watching HGTV",6/4/1994 17:04
1565,1997, I agree that was a comment that was only intended to incite people not bring about any actual rational discussion. ,9/10/2020 9:04
1565,1565, I agree. I do think the #MEtoo movement has been very helpful for women but i think that's a stretch. I do think that people like my grandma and Catehrine Glanagan really started the moevement. ,1/15/1994 5:19
1565,1997, I find it hard to join the conversation. I can see points from both sides. As a woman it is hard for me to be told by men what I should do with my health care and what should be covered but I think the other side of it is taking even the smallest offenses and instead of letting it go blowing it hugely out of proportion. ,8/8/2002 10:15
1565,1997," I completely agree. I think there is a balance between voting and holding men accountable but still not making men the enemy. Gender aside, it's pretty sad that voter tturnout in the US hasn't been above 63% in over 100 years!!! I find it such a privilege. ",8/22/2009 22:22
1565,1997, So true. How can we not participate in something so important to our country's future? There are people the world over dying because they want the same rights we have and a third of Americans are just ignoring that right. ,8/15/1975 19:32
1565,1565," I know- i'm not sure how i feel though about Nevada having a none of these candidates option. In  my mind, that's the same as not voting. ",3/1/1991 3:36
1565,1997, I think if people were more inclined to vote 3rd party we would start to see real change but so many get this hyper focus on the two party system and it is leading us down a bad path. ,2/14/1997 22:02
1565,1997," I agree. Did you know that Astronauts vote from space??!?! sointeresting . i dont know if i was in space, i would care about whats going on down on earth haha",9/24/2017 23:53
1565,1997, That is quite interesting. I think we have turned voting into a spectacle instead of the serious thing it is supposed to be. I mean renaming a garbage dump seems like a silly ballot to have. ,12/5/1976 11:58
1565,1997," I agree but then again when people don't have the right to vote for so long and still don[t have the right t ovote, they will want to vote on anything. LIKe 34% of black men in alamaba can't vote ever again. ",11/22/1990 14:05
1566,1566, I wonder why that is? What keeps a person from being able to vote?,1/27/1985 14:58
1566,1118, If they were convicted of certain crimes? I'm not sure what else could prevent that other tahn just blatant discrimination. ,5/19/1988 8:49
1566,1566, Which is always a possiblity sadly. It seems like america goes out of its way to make it difficult on voters while other countries are leaping through hoops to make things happen for their people. ,9/4/1976 22:45
1566,1566, Agreed. India even sets up polling in forests for one voter. In America we do it midweek where people can't even get there unless they can take off work. ,4/19/2003 6:01
1566,1118, exactly! I think we are so far removed from the process that we just see it as normal now. I like what the ancient athenians did with holding a lottery. I think that would be something that would shake things up a bit. ,10/13/1979 1:38
1566,1566," Can you imagine!! Maybe a short candidate would start to win!! As a short person myself (i'm 5'1), i think it's sad that the taller person has won 75 % of the time in the past 119 years !",1/20/1972 19:00
1566,1566, It has become a popularity constest almost. I think the advent of social media is making society focus less on the politics and more on the feelings which isn't the way to run a country. ,4/1/2019 11:13
1566,1566, Totally agree. Have you ever been to the white house? I had no idea that there were solar panels put in by George Bush!,1/29/1971 20:43
1566,1118, I think the switch to renewable energy is a responsible choice by any president. That is really awesome. ,3/17/1972 11:29
1566,1118, It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote. ,7/13/1984 1:34
1567,359, I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.,12/22/2013 2:44
1567,359," In the same token, it is their right to vote or not to vote.",1/4/1998 0:55
1567,359," yeah. Just seems like a lot of peopple worked hard for woman to ignore that right. But you are correct. Plus, it's really inconvenient!",1/18/1978 19:32
1567,1567," My only issue with the matter is that we talk a lot about these individuals and are very apt to getting mad when people don't excersise this right soley on the basis of women getting it, but we seem to forget how many men fought for this right too in the beginning of this country.",8/31/1981 14:42
1567,359, That is true and a great perspective. I agree that a lot of the rights americans have are usually taken for granted with the inclusion of time. Think about the draft now a days. There would be a mutany! Yet many of the brave soldiers for Vietnam were drafted.,9/14/1982 5:38
1567,1567," That is why I can understand McDonalds point of view and frustration, but wonder what her grandmother would say today. Would she be so upset?",1/31/2002 3:40
1567,1567, I hope so or McDonald is upset for nothing. I at least hope people understand the sacrifice. I for one do and vote every election. Even the meaningless local elections.,1/28/1977 8:30
1567,359," Same here.  I am amazed at the statistics of voter turnout, however, with it stating that we haven't seen more than 2/3 of the population vote in over 100 years.  More and more people are frustrated with the current state of affairs and it seems like the election doesn't change anything.",4/10/2013 4:54
1567,1567," That's exactly why I vote, I can make a difference, even if statistically, my vote doesn't count.",9/6/2005 23:25
1567,1567," You wonder what our way of voting will be like in 20 years.  Will it look the same with polling booths, ballots, etc?",4/30/1978 6:37
1568,1568, That is a good question. I wonder if accusations of voter fraud will impact it at all?,1/23/1992 11:20
1568,1485," Or, if more states will allow us to vote for none of the candidates?  Or will write-ins be more popular?  Maybe we will just end up liking someones status of social media and that will be good enough.  Interesting to think about",8/4/2013 4:14
1568,1485, Yeah. I live in Illinois and we can skip voting on a race if we choose to. Can you do the same?,4/5/2022 9:02
1568,1568," Same here.  You wonder, however, will states mandate your vote.  Maybe not get tax return if you haven't voted?  Wanting to boost voter turnout if it gets bad enough",7/28/1998 16:20
1568,1568, There's a crazy election process that other countries use. The lowest vote total get booted from the ballot and then revote happens. This happens until there is one person left.,5/5/2005 9:10
1568,1568, Survival of the fittest. Not a bad idea I guess.  Much like our primaries.  Maybe we just do Hunger Games style and see what happens.,6/8/1982 17:57
1568,1485, That sure would be an interesting dynamic to add to the debates!,6/18/1995 20:20
1568,1485, Hulk Hogan and the Rock (Duane Johnson) have both said they have considered running.  That would benefit them I guess.  ,2/21/1979 23:31
1568,1485," Not sure Hogan would be a good choice, with his racial slurs being caught on video and all. The Rock would do well. Plus he's easy on the eyes...",1/3/1977 0:30
1568,1568," That and they say that generally the taller the candidate, the more likely they win.",10/3/1995 14:58
1569,861, Nice chatting with you!,1/2/1971 14:33
1569,861, How do you like Nickelodeon?  They did get political though but celebrated and honored those participating in the March for Our Lives to address gun control and stop mass shootings.,9/12/1978 6:20
1569,861, Nickelodeon ? That channel for kids ? I mean we watched it only when my kids were really young... not anymore... who else do You think watches that... ?,12/30/1979 2:32
1569,861, Parents you are appeasing their kids watch it of course!  Millions were watching the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards.,5/31/1997 22:01
1569,1569," oh crap, I had no idea... well, is channel like that even CAN be political ? I mean, aren't there any regulations to prevent something like that from happening ?",11/11/2002 12:48
1569,1569, They are private so they can do that I'm sure and they are trying to promote educational purposes it sounds like but it does sound like it could send a biased message to kids.,11/14/2001 15:24
1569,1569, I don't know about You but to me it sounds like brain washing young minds which don't really know what is going on in the real world...,12/1/1981 5:27
1569,1569, I guess that is why it is important for parents to talk to their kids and kids to listen to their parents!  Do you watch Spider Man?  The favorite movie actress went to Zendaya aged 21 of Spider-Man Homecoming and The Great Showman,2/6/1982 5:10
1569,861, I do watch spider-man - I can't say I liked any of the actors playing Peter Parker... did You like it ? I want to watch the new one - Into the Spider-verse or something like that... I heard it's goo.,12/21/1987 0:02
1569,1569," I like them.  Zendaya, only 21, told kids to never let anybody tell you that your age should limit you from actually doing whatever you think you need to do in the world.  Maybe somewhat inspirational, but maybe it will inspire kids to defy authority and elders",4/3/2022 19:30
1570,1570, I don't know about that... my daughter when she was 13 still wanted to wear her tutu skirt on her birthday... I didn't let her ;(,11/25/1971 22:12
1570,1570," Did you ever watch Stranger things?  Apparently, the actress playing eleven's mother lived her whole life without legs.",12/10/1970 21:30
1570,1570," oh man, poor thing... I hope her head is in the right place... Yes, I love the show, do You like it ? What do You think about it ?",9/8/2011 7:21
1570,415, I have no clue but it is a science fiction-horror web tv series on Netflix,8/26/1981 3:04
1570,1570," First I thought it's like for kids, but they did such a great job in showing the 80s - the music, clothing, cars and posters... it wakes up the nostalgia in me ;) so I keep watching ;)",1/17/2000 21:13
1570,1570, Why does the character have a number name eleven?,3/17/2014 12:11
1570,415, She was a part of the experiments of mind control and moving to other dimensions to hear what the Russians are plotting about - and all previous experiment subjects failed. She is number 11 and is successful ;),12/13/2001 3:07
1570,1570," Oh, like R2-D2 maybe robotic?  Who is your favorite actor in the show?  Is it Winona Ryder?",6/7/1992 5:39
1570,1570, R2D2 was doing telekinesis ? ;) I don't remember that ;) I hate Winona Ryder in that show... kids are acting better than she is. I like the kid that's in Verizon commercials now ;),1/13/1976 9:27
1570,1570, Do you like Youtube? You can find almost any information on how to do things or watch things there.  It is the second largest search engine on the net.,4/16/1990 20:12
1571,1571, I do find Youtube very useful when I need to do something not entirely legal with my PC ;) or free cable ;),7/30/1973 8:59
1571,1793, Half of the peak internet traffic in North America is made up by Netflix and Youtube!  Nice chatting.,4/25/2011 14:27
1571,1571, It is crazy how far youtube has come in such a short amount of time. ,11/26/1982 7:48
1571,1571, I totally agree with you on that.  I mean It was just created in 2005 and look at it now!,1/19/1976 11:26
1571,1571, I never really think of it as a search engine although I guess technically it is. ,3/23/2019 13:15
1571,1571," I guess so since people search for videos.  Speaking of, did you know that Justin Bieber's video is the most disliked on youtube?",6/28/2019 10:05
1571,1793, Not suprising. He is a very polarizing celebrity. ,1/24/1976 19:44
1571,1571, He is at that.  What do you think about Carol Burnett being the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?,4/12/1987 21:43
1571,1571, Not surprising. She is quite hilarious. A good fit for a show like that. ,1/14/2008 19:13
1571,1571," She is really funny.  She's probably been searched a lot on youtube.  Speaking of, I've heard that youtube combined with netfilx makes up half of the peak internet traffic in the country.",5/19/2017 15:27
1572,1572, I think it is cool that youtube is pairing with tv stations to offer streaming for people that don't want cable. ,8/26/2008 16:46
1572,1572, I do too.  The site is owned by Google so hopefully that will keep costs down.,10/30/1994 19:15
1572,1507, It is really neat that the police have their own version of youtube. I would love to see some of the car chase videos. ,9/14/1995 21:49
1572,1507," I wonder if their site has the real videos, you know, nothing edited out or anything.",2/8/1993 8:02
1572,1572, I'm sure it is. I wonder if it is able to be accessed for trials and such. ,9/2/2011 15:48
1572,1572," That's an interesting thought.  I don't know.  That reminds me of Judge Judy.  Did you know she makes $123,000 per episode?",1/9/1997 16:14
1572,1507, I didn't. I'm not a fan of her. She doesn't seem like she follows the rules and just sort of goes with how she feels and if the people annoy her to make a ruling. ,7/17/2022 12:20
1572,1572, She does sometimes but those people agree to abide by her verdict when they go on her show.  i wonder if they do that because she is a celebrity.  She gets a lot of attention from the media and such.,7/7/2015 23:10
1572,1507, Maybe. I wonder if she has ever voiced a character based on her in a cartoon. That seems like a popular celebrity thing to do. ,3/25/1994 11:10
1572,1507," Yeah, ever since Robin Williams did Aladdin it has become a trend.",11/10/2014 3:08
1573,435, I miss Robin Williams. He was a one of a kind talent. ,7/15/1979 17:41
1573,1573, He truly was.  It's sad to learn that he was depressed when he always seemed so upbeat and happy.  I wonder if he visited the secret room Pixar studio has.,9/23/1979 9:58
1573,435, I could see him doing that. I think he really loved animated films like that. He tried so hard to make everyone around him laugh while he was so sad inside. ,7/23/2013 18:38
1573,1573, Have you seen the tv show Stranger Things?  It is quite the interesting horrow show,12/20/1988 16:16
1573,435, I havnt. Is it any good.,5/30/2010 12:05
1573,1573, Yes it was originally based on Project Montauk - a supposed secret government program involving kidnapping children.,10/10/1982 18:24
1573,1573, Well it certainly sounds interesting.,11/8/2009 18:01
1573,1573, It has some famous stars in it like Winona Ryder and David Harbour,2/23/2000 6:01
1573,1573, Thats cool. I like both of those actors.,4/14/1974 21:27
1573,1573, Do you know any celebrities?  I met Robin Williams once right after he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films,7/9/1995 7:25
1574,680, I dont personally know any. Do you.,5/25/1973 8:26
1574,680," I met Judge Judy once - she makes $123k per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James.",1/8/1983 8:50
1574,1574, I would rather watch her than lebron any day. Lol.,9/17/1972 15:18
1574,1574, Ethopia has a celebrity tv chef who is trying to combat hunger in his country,2/20/1977 23:50
1574,1574, That is good of him to do. Wonder how he is doing it.,11/8/2013 8:15
1574,680, He is encourage everyone to eat more diverse foods.,9/5/2021 4:40
1574,680, I dont really see how that is combating hunger but ok.,7/22/2005 10:24
1574,680, It helps with farmers growing more crops and diversifying the fields.  I think it is funny that Pixar studio has a whole secret room for celebrities.,6/27/1971 11:32
1574,680, That is cool. I would really like to see that room.,7/23/2007 7:32
1574,680, I wonder if Carol Burnett ever went there - she was the very first celebrity to ever be on Sesame Street!,12/10/1996 22:41
1575,168, Im sure she has. I was never a big carol burnett fan tho.,1/23/2005 5:36
1575,168, Do you have any favorite videos on youtube?  That is a huge website these days..,3/6/1990 3:24
1575,168, I just watch it to find out how to do stuff. Like work on the car or something.,5/17/2002 0:07
1575,168, It is the largest searchengine out there.,9/11/1986 0:52
1575,1575, Hi there! How are you today? I've been watching TV.,2/1/1972 21:05
1575,168, Hey oh nice me too! What are your thoughts on politics in Hollywood? I think it is ridiculous! Event the kids choice awards are getting involved!,1/18/1993 12:33
1575,1575, I have heard that The Nickelodeon kids choice awards got political. ,10/6/2013 14:42
1575,168, Yeah. Even back when they did their little voting campaign. MTV even paid to bus people to a march in Washington.,4/19/2015 22:10
1575,168, That's insane! I know Jaden Smith was a presenter that announced his presence at the March of Our Lives.,3/15/2004 22:07
1575,168, Oh interesting. I think actors should just focus on acting. Like the Stranger Things tv show was amazing. So glad the Duffer Brothers created it.,7/13/1997 12:34
1576,1701," Yes, agree! I'm not familiar with that show, but I think celebrities or celeb for slang should be neutral. ",2/17/1975 5:39
1576,1576, Oh the show is great-it's on Netflix. Celebs are popular though. There is a guy with the same name as Justin Bieber who was banned from FB!,11/8/2015 9:09
1576,1701, Haha-that's great. Was it the show originally based on a secret government program involving the kidnapping of children for use in mind control experiments?,4/11/2014 9:44
1576,1701, Yeah exactly! And actually David Harbour is an actor on the show and he tore his Achilles before!,3/27/1982 12:20
1576,1576," Oh, weird. I heard the actress that portrays Eleven's mom has lived her whole life with no legs.",10/6/1976 11:18
1576,1701, Holy cow that would be tough. The Stranger Things title font is also used in Paramounts fbi piracy warning!,5/27/2010 10:17
1576,1576," It would be tough. Oh, weird about the font! I am not into this type show, but I love shows like Judge Judy. Amazingly enough she is one of the highest paid celebs making 123k per episode!",10/20/2011 3:33
1576,1701," Oh wow. Yeah that is a good show. Do you like youtube? YT celebrity Jenna Marbles makes 346,000 per year!",3/3/2002 7:41
1576,1701, I do not know who that is. I know You Tube is the second largest search engine on the net though.,8/15/1991 6:09
1576,1576, Yeah so much power. Guess who was the most overrated celebrity in 2007: Paris Hilton lol.,1/26/2001 10:13
1577,1774," Yeah, I have not heard about her lately. I know You Tube was started by three former Paypal employees. What a good move!",9/30/1998 10:27
1577,1774, Yeah I thank them for that because I use it so much. It was created back in 2005! It is a google subsidiary.,4/29/1999 3:44
1577,1577, Did you know police have their own type of YouTube called blutube where they share law enforcement videos?,8/16/2003 20:07
1577,1577, No I wonder if it helps catch criminals? Most of the content uploaded to youtube is by individuals but youtube also has some paid partnerships as well.,12/22/1997 13:18
1577,1774," I am not sure, but I'd think so! Youtube and Netflix make up half of peak internet traffic in north America. That might be why the cops have their own.",3/10/1979 21:33
1577,1774, Yeah good point. Google actually created a network that watched 10 minute youtube clips to recognize cats. Nice chatting with you!,4/19/2000 16:06
1577,1774, Do you like hockey?,7/10/1971 13:54
1577,1774, A little! I watch NHL games sometimes. Did you know that the USA olympic women's hockey team lost to a HS team?,9/2/1975 4:05
1577,1577," I bet that was humiliating, that's a hard defeat to recover from",2/15/1983 0:19
1577,1774, Maybe they were just really good? India even beat the US 24-1 in the 1932 Olympics.,6/26/1972 0:34
1578,1578, Or maybe we have a terrible team. Did you hear about that hockey player that was traded for only one dollar?,11/14/2014 16:46
1578,1578, Maybe! Ha no I didn't hear about that. Pretty embarrassing I think. Do you listen to country music?,4/21/1996 16:14
1578,1578," I do like country music, one of my favorite music genres, do you listen to it, do you like it?",6/8/2003 20:07
1578,1906, I have recently started to listen to country music and I really like it. It used to be called Hillbilly music haha but Connie B. Gay coined the term Country music.,11/2/1982 0:31
1578,1906, I dont know about about Connie B but I do like George Strait,1/18/1983 5:51
1578,1578," I do too, and Darius Rucker! In 1966 the album NFL Country was released. NFL players sang along with country music stars haha",4/19/1990 15:50
1578,1906," That sounds like a great album, U2 used to play country in disguised, they wore wigs and costumes",3/25/2012 0:33
1578,1578, That's interesting! I didn't know that and I'm a fan of U2. I heard that the Fender Stratocaster was intended only for country music.,11/29/1986 13:36
1578,1578, U2 is a great band and the Strotocaster is the best guitar ever!,7/3/1989 9:15
1578,1578," Agreed! Off topic, did you know that the direction of Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200k-300k years?",6/17/2009 8:35
1579,1579, No I didnt know that on the other hand I did now we will be helium free by the end of this century,5/16/1994 7:57
1579,519, I wonder why and I wonder how people will be affected. I'm amazing to think that the earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun.,6/28/1994 3:43
1579,519," The earth is just amazing, 71% of it is water and we live in a tiny 29% ",6/20/2020 8:35
1579,1579, It is. And Jupiter protects the Earth from asteroids. The whole solar system is just amazing.,5/6/1993 13:39
1579,519, So Jupiter is basically our superhero? I guess not all heroes wear capes lol,4/22/2004 8:33
1579,519, Haha very true. I was also really surprised to learn that you could fit all the planets between earth and the moon and still have room to spare.,5/2/2003 18:12
1579,1579," That is amazing, the moon looks so close but its so far away, thanks a lot for the chat by the way",8/12/1977 14:10
1579,1579, Great chat! Have a good day/night,2/1/1984 8:23
1579,1579," Great chat indeed, a lot of cool facts, info, thanks again and have a great night",1/28/2001 6:11
1579,1579, Are you much of a hockey fan?,10/26/1996 10:41
1580,1144, Not really. Just never got into ito it to much. How about you.,2/10/1977 10:53
1580,1144, I'm a pretty big fan. It's a fast game & the players really give it their all. In fact an average pro hockey player loses up to 8 pounds a game.,5/29/2013 23:13
1580,1144, That is crazy. Did you know that a new england high school team actually beat the womens olympic team 6-3.,3/11/2015 10:52
1580,1580, That's surprising & embarrassing for the women's team. I appreciate the history of the sport. Hockey was in the first Winter Olympic games all the way back in 1924.,11/17/2009 18:03
1580,1144, I heard that. Allso it 1932 india beat the US 24-1 Thats kind of embarrassing as well.,9/20/2012 10:47
1580,1144, Really? That's how sports are sometimes I guess. Are you much of a country music fan?,5/29/2021 3:25
1580,1144, Yeah I love country music.,7/3/2000 9:52
1580,1580, Did you know that U2 once opened for themselves in costumes as a fake country band in 1987?,3/24/2019 16:59
1580,1144, I did hear that actually. Its funny that nobody noticed it was them.,9/12/2003 13:02
1580,1580, Yeah you'd think the crowd wold notice that. I recently read that George Strait & Jeff Bezos are cousins. Who would have guessed that?,1/21/1976 20:38
1581,355, Not me. Lot of talent in that family huh.,6/1/1990 3:31
1581,355, Henry Ford helped finance & make country music popular because he thought Jazz was decadent.,1/20/1993 17:11
1581,355," I dont know, I kind of like jazz. In 96 a nfl country was released. Did you hear about that.",11/13/1986 17:01
1581,355, No I didn't know that. Do you read much about science especially earth science?,6/17/2018 20:53
1581,1581," Yeah, my son is really into science, so we are always learning new stuff and doing little experiments.",3/28/2010 8:22
1581,355, Did you know that when the Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long?,7/27/1970 12:51
1581,355, That would really make it hard to get the yard mowed huh.,6/20/1977 5:43
1581,1581," Lol, yeah I think so. Once sad thing is that more than 80 percent of the earth's forests have been destroyed.",5/16/2002 4:58
1581,355, That is sad to think about.,7/20/1976 13:37
1581,1581, Yes it's very sad. I enjoyed talking with you. Hopefully you have a good day.,7/24/2003 18:16
1582,1582, Hello,8/29/2019 9:17
1582,1582, Hello.  Do you know that there are many types of hockey?,4/27/2004 8:10
1582,1582, I do.  I played in elementary school,10/3/2001 2:04
1582,1582, What kind do you play?  Is it field or ice hockey?,5/1/2005 8:40
1582,1582, Ice hockey. I think field hockey is for those who take it a bit less seriously.,8/18/2001 3:38
1582,1582, I see.   Was it hard to move a puck around? ,5/14/1989 23:10
1582,1582," for the most part, I spent 98% of my time on the net.  The only time I ever got pulled off goal was to do workouts or coordination work.",5/31/1979 15:43
1582,1319, How difficult is it to use a hockey stick compared to baseball bat?,11/23/1996 11:35
1582,1319," In someways the same and some different.  It's a bit like the idea of trying to play golf with a bat.  Honestly, it's a little bit like fast paced competitive floor sweeping really.",9/1/1972 0:22
1582,1582, I read an article that says An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.  Did it happen to you?,1/30/1982 20:18
1583,1583, it's a bit like taking a shower with your clothing on.  You finish and you are soaked.  One way to get around the misery is to chew gum.  It keeps your mouth from drying out.,5/12/1996 1:14
1583,1812, I see.  Did players lose weight fast only in one game?,12/1/2009 11:02
1583,1812," oh totally, but it's...  usually afterwards, you drink a bottle of gatorade or powerade or even orange juice and you have recovered a lot of what you lost.  Everybody is different, but an hour after a game or a heavy practice and you are back to where you were, mostly.  Worst case, eat a donut or a couple clif bars.",3/21/2011 16:16
1583,1812, Interesting. Thank you for your explanation.  Do you like country music?,11/5/1996 4:04
1583,1583, I'm listening to country right now.  I put some Darius Rucker on,4/5/2000 20:34
1583,1812, nice.  I did not know that country music was originated in the south.  Do you know what state?,9/6/1982 14:37
1583,1583, I actually would have guessed Georgia.  It seems like a place where country would be really popular.,9/25/2000 22:32
1583,1583, I am curious and I will research further later.  Country musicians use mostly string instruments.  Do they use drums?,1/24/1997 7:11
1583,1583," oh, for sure.   other instruments, like banjos, pianos, horns and even organs show up, but lead guitar, bass and drums are still fairly common",2/13/1992 4:18
1583,1812, Do you know that Amazon CEO and the country music legend george strait are cousins?,3/6/2008 3:12
1584,1584, I did not.  George Strait must be related to everybody.  His family must be huge,5/1/2022 18:52
1584,1311, I can't believe the Golden Knights almost won the Stanley cup on their inaugural season. ,3/2/2013 8:57
1584,1584, That's awesome! Were they the one who had the player who was traded for $1?,1/26/2013 21:43
1584,1584," I don't believe so. They just had their first season last year, and did really well, when no one thought they would.",9/21/1986 19:44
1584,1311," Oh. okay. The player who was traded, went on to win four Stanley cups.",10/19/2017 4:11
1584,1311," That's interesting, I was completely unaware of that. But yeah, the Golden Knights didn't do bad at all, were 1 game from being champions.",1/2/2016 4:18
1584,1311, It's saddening that only 20% of Earth's natural forests remain.,4/25/1989 0:14
1584,1311," Yeah, I certainly am not too enthused with the way things are going with the planet being abused lately.  For a 4.5 billion year old planet, it's a shame watching it get abused.",4/21/1978 10:32
1584,1584, We will be helium-free by the end of the century.,10/29/1991 19:00
1584,1584," I never knew that, but that's an interesting fact. I wonder if helium has any other uses than balloons. I would assume so, but I don't know definitively.",7/27/1984 3:20
1585,796, Helium has a lot of other uses. Earth is also the most dense planet in the universe.,5/13/2010 2:04
1585,1585, I never knew that. It's crazy to think when earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long.,11/1/2006 6:11
1585,796," That's interestin, as humans only represent a little over 1 minute in the 24 hour period.",3/3/2014 9:14
1585,796," Very intriguing. On that note of humans, it's interesting to note that country music (or western) has been around since the 20's. While I'm not a fan, it's still interesting.",6/1/2008 17:12
1585,796," Yes, and George Strait is a cousin of Jeff Bezos.",9/8/1984 8:13
1585,796," I used to be a big fan of Amazon, but not so much lately, so I'm ok with them being related. And Henry Ford helped popularize country music.",3/29/2021 6:34
1585,1585, You can't really pick your relatives... I was surprised to learn that the Stratocaster was  developed for country music.,11/14/2002 15:52
1585,1585," That's pretty interesting to know, but it kind of makes sense with country being as old as it is, and rock not coming around until much later.",11/19/2013 14:24
1585,1585," Canada has two national sports, my favorite is lacrosse.",6/25/2001 11:50
1585,1585, I would assume the other being hockey. I know little of either (but more about hockey).,3/17/2019 3:49
1586,1586," Yes, hockey is the other one.",2/13/1996 7:24
1586,284, I do know that in 1924 in the first Olympics team Canada scored 132 goals versus 3 they allowed.,4/18/1996 17:37
1586,284, Did they have a hockey rink under the basketball court?,6/4/1970 8:16
1586,1586," I do believe so. I had a friend who played hockey, and said they can lose up to 8 pounds in a game.",1/9/2003 13:05
1586,284," That's a lot! Thank you for chatting with me, enjoy your day.",9/6/2018 21:48
1586,284, You have a swell day as well.,2/29/2000 17:40
1586,284, Thanks,11/7/1981 19:42
1586,1586," Hello, do you like comedy?",4/7/1996 22:39
1586,284," Sure! Like Bill Murray, I think Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy. You?",6/21/2007 22:56
1586,1586," Yes, I liked Bill Murray back in the day when Kung Fu Hustle was out back in the 70's I think.  But now, I really like the lady comedies that were out not too long ago.like 'Bad Teacher', 'Bad Moms', and all those other funny movies led by the ladies.",12/27/1977 0:56
1587,1736," Yeah. There was a time period where quite a few chick comedies came out that were pretty good, but we seem to be in a slump these days. Am I right?",8/3/2003 8:34
1587,1587, True. Melissa McCarthy had quite a few comedy movies like Bridesmaids that was hilarious. Bridesmaids made over $169 million and was the second highest grossing movie of the year that wasn't a sequel.,9/15/1979 1:49
1587,1736," She shined in that role.  But more typical these days are flops like, The Spy Who Dumped Me  --  Did they really think a movie with the word Dumped in the title was going to fair well?",4/26/2022 7:25
1587,1736, Good point. I like Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon's movie. It made just $24 million taken in it's first two weeks. ,3/7/2022 4:23
1587,1736, Not quite as popular as the movie Girls Trip but not a total loss like the movie Rough Night,11/14/2013 9:34
1587,1587," Yes, I really liked Girls' Trip, I thought it was really funny and I loved the cast.  I also liked male version movies with names like 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' and the 'Hangover' which had their heyday in the 2000s.",3/17/2011 15:21
1587,1587," Yeah, but it has been a few years since be had a popular bromance like the Hangover or Harold and Kumar...",7/9/1995 19:35
1587,1736, That's true. Since there is a genre of movies called bromantic comedies that also included Pineapple Express as well. ,12/23/2021 11:00
1587,1587," Yeah. If you find a good comedian that can also act, and find th eright situation for them, you can get a pretty good film. But comedians thrive on failure too. Did you know that comedian Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy?",5/29/2019 0:12
1587,1736," Yeah, I've heard that one already as well. Comparatively speaking, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star with over $8.5 billion in worldwide film earnings. He's both an actor and a celebrated comedian.",6/29/2019 15:23
1588,1247," Talented comedian!  I also like comedian Demetri Martin. He's quite brilliant too!  He was accepted in into Harvard Law School, but dropped out because he was bored to pursue comedy. I'm thankful for that!",2/2/1986 23:26
1588,1588," Yeah, comedy is still basically tied to its roots and originally came from theatrical Greek comedy. This is where two opposing sides are depicted as youth vs. the older generation and the youth loses because the young people are relatively powerless compared to their elders, in essence.",4/17/2014 22:12
1588,1588," Deep.  So answer me this: Why did Trojan Wars do so bad at the box office, earning only $309, when the film had a $15 million budget? Was it a straight video film?",12/28/2020 2:29
1588,1588," Wow, that's a good question. I don't know the answer but I do know that Disney's 'treasure planet' was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time. So that was worse than the Trojan Wars movie.",12/3/1979 20:50
1588,1247," Was it as bad as Disney's Sleeping Beauty episode? Apparently, Disney considering closing down their animation studio when that movie failed expectations. Good thing they did not!",10/7/1994 22:19
1588,1247," So, there's been a lot of flops out there as well as successes. I remember the Silence of the Lambs that came out on Valentine's Day 1991 and had a box office take of over $270 million. Wow.",10/14/1980 6:20
1588,1588," A great date night movie for Valentines Day... Maybe a dinner theater where you and your partner can dine on Liver and Far var bean with a nice Chianti?   No, I would definitely still prefer a good old fashion slap stick comedy!",10/21/1996 0:46
1588,1588," Me too! Nice chatting with you, have a good one!",7/19/1984 20:20
1588,1247," Hi, Do you remember Dennis Rodman from the Bulls?  He visited Singapore for the Summit between Trump and Kim.",6/19/2010 5:06
1588,1247," Hello,  Yes I remember him,  he had different colored hair all the time!  Awesome.  ",6/2/1987 18:55
1589,1589, It seems like he was helping to bring peace between the countries.  He helped bring some awareness of issues.  He's been there multiple times since 2013.,10/2/2007 2:03
1589,1504, It looks like Spain is a guest at every g20 summit!  ,3/14/1974 15:52
1589,1504, Wow!  Can you picture it with Rodman leaving North Korea last year wearing a t-shirt that said Ambassador Rodman!  I wonder if he still dyes his hair or if he has to follow a different dress code.,6/21/2019 8:24
1589,1589," He can probably do whatever he wants since he was once a popular name. Speaking of North Korea,  it says Kim Jong un learned to drive at age 3,  wow Koreans must be pretty lax on driving laws lol ",12/5/2012 13:50
1589,1589, That sounds pretty scary.  Why do they do that?,2/20/2020 11:00
1589,1504, Why do they do what?  ,8/29/1988 1:21
1589,1504, Why did they teach Kim Jong to drive at age 3?  ,12/2/1975 13:47
1589,1504," I do not know.  I don't even know if anyone actually taught him.  I read recently that he LEARNED to drive at age 3.  He could've taught himself or stolen a car and learned by trial and error,  he could've watched youtube and followed instructions on driving. Not really sure,  there could be a lot of possibilities.",3/20/1972 20:19
1589,1504, I don't think youtube was around in 1986.    He was born in 1983 as the second child of Kim Jong-il and Ko Yong-hui.  Seems to have come from a line of leaders including the first leader of North Korea Kim II-sung,7/11/1974 21:51
1589,1504," That wasn't really the point(ref Youtube) lol Yes,  his father and grandfather before him were Prime Ministers as well. ",6/14/1971 12:53
1590,1590, Kim Jong un must be a handsome guy because he was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion and china believes it.,2/14/1979 16:17
1590,1256," lol I thought that was funny,  who is the onion?  I think its funny that I read no one knows how old kim jong un is.  Thats cuz Korean way of deciding age is different thatn america. ",1/21/1982 13:14
1590,1590," It says he was born January 8, 1983 making him 36 this week",11/9/1972 5:12
1590,1256," Not really.  In Korea,  when you are born you are already 1 year old.  also if you are born in dec or jan,  before korean new year,  on Korean New Year you turn 2.  So its weird.  They don't calculate it like America. ",12/13/1985 15:55
1590,1590, Interesting.  I guess they are correct.  I wonder if that is because they view life as starting at conception.,5/14/1975 4:48
1590,1590, oops sorry I made a mistake.  Yes everyone is 1 year old when they are born and all babies turn 2 on their next korean new years.  not just babies born in dec or jan.  So a baby can be less than a week old and be 2 years old. ,8/6/1997 9:37
1590,1256," Oh, that's a little confusing to me.  Do you like basketball?  Did you know that the highest paid state employee is either a basketball or football coach in 39 of the 50 states?  Good use of tax dollars.",3/7/2014 12:10
1590,1256," Right,  that is a little weird.  But good for them!  They making good money!",10/25/1994 23:23
1590,1256," Yes, they are!  I wonder if they work more hours than most in government that their pay is so high.  The inventor of basketball was a coach, but was the only losing coach in University of Kansas' history. Nice talking to you!",6/18/2004 6:15
1590,1590, I wonder how much of a voice we should give to a celebrity when it comes to foreign policy,11/5/2011 22:11
1591,332," In my opinion, for the most cases none.  Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un for example is pretty crazy.",1/14/1998 19:01
1591,332, Right!? He seems to be making headway though so how much leadway is good to give him or should he be granted official ambassador status because of their friendship?,6/4/2020 2:06
1591,1591,  Rodman always speaks very favorably of Kim Jong Un and theres more to it than that.,5/30/2001 6:04
1591,1591, I think while he does speak highly of him that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It may be him taking advantage of a situation to keep an enemy closer for an avantage for his own country something our politicians might be smart to use. ,7/27/1984 16:24
1591,1591," I could normally believe that, but I haven't personally heard of Rodman doing something that wasn't for himself.  Him wearing an Ambassador Rodman shirt totally shifted the attention on himself.",11/10/1987 15:31
1591,1591, Valid point but during the trying times in which we live any avenue to a summit without controversy or spying is a good thing. ,7/23/1995 21:08
1591,1591, That I can agree with.  But  I don't think Kim Jong Un wants to change at all.,12/27/2014 23:31
1591,332, No I don't think so either. He's a man who has been fed a certin retorhic all his life and now passes that on to his people. I think we are wise to be wary but that doesn't mean we won't have to deal with him eventually. I think one of the smart things the president has done is have a meeting with him. ,9/12/2016 3:14
1591,1591," Yup, for sure.  I wouldn't mind seeing a second meeting.  COnsidering we don't really know how old kim jong un is, it would be wise to at least be cordial for the time being.",6/2/2019 3:39
1591,1591," I think of that meeting as a summit like with stalin, churchhill, and roosevelt. The times we are in don't seem that dissimilar. ",4/16/2010 23:05
1592,1592," It does seem to be quite chaotic.  Curious what the next few years bring.  And what direction kim jong un takes north korea.  He's certainly in charge, being the Marshal and all.",6/12/2021 7:41
1592,874, We seem to have a lot of summit events but nothing is getting accomplished. Makes sense why Spain doesn't actually want to be part of the g20.,10/12/2009 3:45
1592,1592," Spain doesn't impress me.  They seem to only be out for themselves, but are eager to take any handouts they can get.  I'd like to see them more involved internationally.  Not in the way Russia is though.  During a past g20 summit they gave delegates thumb drives containing viruses so they could spy on them.",8/8/1986 6:12
1592,874, The fact that a satire group risked imprisionment to impersonate some of Apec says to me that people see these as nothing but a big joke or a chance to steal information. ,11/29/1997 19:34
1592,874," Quite possibly.  The canadian prime minister told Putin he needed to get out of ukraine, and you see how that went.",5/25/1994 20:01
1592,874, Honestly they seem like large children trying to all get their way with temper tantrums and foot stomping. ,6/24/1980 8:09
1592,1592, And nothing gets done.  It seems like there are so many summits now that they really aren't anything special.  They are pretty much just a form of international governance at this point.  ,2/15/1980 16:06
1592,1592," Exactly! I thnk the media has fueled this as well especially with inflammatory reports like the ones with Rodman, Trump and Kim. ",10/13/1985 3:53
1592,874," The media seems to fuel everything, just to get ratings.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.  One of the more enjoyable one of these that I've had.",7/8/2005 21:22
1592,874, You as well. It is nice to have a well reasoned discussion of things. ,1/15/2003 12:54
1593,1593, How's it going? Did you know that the term summit wasn't used until 1955?,1/20/1990 10:02
1593,1593," Hi, yourself.  No I didn't know that.  I know a summit is a big deal international meeting with lots of heads of state or governments.  Usually you hear about the G20 summit.",8/23/1982 11:24
1593,1890," Yea, I'm surprised at the g20 the Canadia PM shook Putin's hand and told him to get out the Ukraine, I would be more stern with Putin if I was there",8/7/2008 5:06
1593,1593," Ok, it's pretty risky saying that to Putin.  I heard the Russians one time gave out phone chargers and thumb drives that contained trojan viruses out at a G20 summit.  ",6/21/2003 4:12
1593,1593, I bet the Russians have a lot of data on Spain since it is the only country that is a permanent guest at the g20,11/6/1971 18:32
1593,1890," I bet they do too.  Do you think Trump and Kim Jong- un are going to have another meeting, like the one in June 2018?",2/27/2021 2:58
1593,1890," Yea probably, the meeting in June 2018 made both of them look good and both could use it as a distraction",6/13/1988 2:20
1593,1593," A distraction or a chance to spy on each other..lol I can't believe Kim Jong-un was voted the sexiest man alive by the Onion, must be a state run organization.",7/23/1978 16:20
1593,1593," Yea that and him learning to drive at the age of 3, sounds too good to be true lol",5/27/2012 1:46
1593,1890, The teacher was probably persuaded to pass him.  A lot of children aren't even fully potty trained at age three.,12/18/1983 11:48
1594,1640, Yea plus Kim Jong has been known to edit pictures to show a different history so I think it's possible he could have photoshopped himself at 3 driving a car,7/14/2002 4:47
1594,1594," How true.  I read somewhere North Korea has theme parks and they are undergoing renovations at kim jong-un's orders.  Can you believe they have theme parks, there?",5/29/2015 6:42
1594,1594, Lol I have read about Kim Jong trying to build like the world's greatest water park to open only when the media is around so I can see him building more theme parks,11/22/1980 20:59
1594,1640," You know, I've heard that nobody really knows how old the guy is anyway.  All this spy technology and intelligence we have should be able to determine his age.  ",3/28/1997 16:23
1594,1594," I've heard he's a big basketball fan, I wonder if basketball coaches in Korea are the highest paid employees like they are in 39 out of 50 states in the US",4/2/1991 0:51
1594,1640," Only if they're winners, I'm sure.  He probably puts the winning coaches up in his palace. Do you watch much basketball?",6/16/2009 17:08
1594,1594," Only if my team (Knicks) have a chance at the postseason, which is mostly no. I think they have a worse record than James Naismith's University of Kansas teams",8/7/1982 4:04
1594,1640," Aww, too bad.  You know He invented basketball.  How ironic is that?",3/17/2016 4:02
1594,1640, Yea you figured since Naismith invented basketball he could of just changed the rules around to help him win lol,10/21/2011 19:16
1594,1594," Exactly my thoughts. You know Kareem Abdul- Jabbar was so good at dunking, it was banned from college basketball for over a decade.",7/13/2005 1:37
1595,519," Kareem should of sued to change the rule, if the case made it to the Supreme Court he could of played with the justices on their basketball court",6/27/2019 5:20
1595,519," That's right.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.  I have to go wash my car, now.  I'll talk to you later.",10/26/1975 18:10
1595,1595," So, it's pretty interesting that Dennis Rodman hasn't commented on that latest Trump/Kim Jong Un Summit. ",6/16/1993 7:28
1595,519, Yeah he might be feeling jealous or hurt that he was not invited.,1/26/1973 21:19
1595,519," Although if he truly feels that emotionally connected to the cause of peace with NK, you'd think he'd be able to set aside personal slights. ",9/18/1976 4:46
1595,519, Yes that is true. I find it funny Shaq has only one recorded 3pt in his whole career.,3/17/2014 4:44
1595,519, I didn't not know that! ,1/24/1993 9:17
1595,1595, How about vasectomy rates rising during march madness. Serves as an excuse for men to stay home and watch the games.,5/10/2003 2:56
1595,1595," I heard that was an urban legend, but if he makes guys more willing to go get the snip, I'm all for it. Do you think Ruth Bader Ginsburg plays H.O.R.S.E. at the SCOTUS court? ",9/11/1981 19:51
1595,519, I would like to see that. The lady is quite up there in age. ,4/29/1973 5:57
1596,1596," Although the hoop is 10 feet tall and she's like, what?, maybe four feet tall? ha.",4/7/1999 1:43
1596,1596, You never know she might have hops. Or come out in Space Jam beast mode. That movie is the highest grossing basketball movie of all time.,10/31/2005 13:24
1596,1596, Even more than Hoosiers? I'd like to see a buddy movie with Rodman and Kim Jong Un. They can go on various adventures. ,3/26/2007 21:12
1596,999, That would be an amazing movie! That movie would be seen world wide.,3/27/1991 8:28
1596,1596," Kim Jong Un can show us how he always shoots holes in one, or how he learned to drive at age 3 or was voted the sexist man alive...and next to Rodman he will seem like a very reasonable person!",4/2/2010 23:20
1596,1596, So is it true Kim jon-un cuts his own hair for fear of barbers?,1/7/1993 4:37
1596,999," Possibly. We don't even know how old he really is, so it's hard to know anything for sure. ",4/5/1974 8:08
1596,999, Very interesting character. I find it funny that his half brother used a fake passport to try getting to Disneyland.,1/2/1979 0:29
1596,999, The same half-brother he had killed? That's what you get for trying to sneak into the Magic Kingdom! ,12/25/2008 6:34
1596,1596, Not the happiest place on earth for that family. He also had a brother who was spotted at an eric clapton concert.,10/31/1979 5:25
1597,214," Holding a lighter and swaying to Layla, most likely. Well, after this last summit broke down, I'm not sure how much more we will see of him. ",10/27/1973 19:01
1597,214, Yeah this summit did not end as everyone was expecting.,3/17/1977 10:55
1597,214, But was it as bad as the g20 summit when Russia gave the US delegates thumb drives and phone chargers containing trojan viruses? ,3/23/1989 1:17
1597,214, That is almost unbelievable. ,8/2/1981 12:34
1597,214, Hi do you like star wars?,11/10/1985 3:47
1597,1597, I love it. Have you seen the FOrce Awakens one?,12/9/1972 9:39
1597,1597, I have and do you know who plays the role of Poe Dameron,4/26/1986 11:36
1597,214, Yeah and he asked that he be a native of planet yavin 4 because it is filmed in guatemala where he is from,1/17/1983 5:37
1597,1597, Nice. Did you know Lucas's wife won the academy award for editing?,8/20/1986 2:35
1597,1597, Yeah because she added some scenes that mad the movie much better,8/28/2016 8:41
1598,1598, Yeah she totally deserved it and glad that she was awarded and recognized for it,1/28/1983 20:16
1598,1598, Exactly. Did you know that 20th century thought star wars was going to flop,1/21/2019 5:31
1598,1623," Yeah and yet it made George a billionaire, He was confident enough in his work",7/2/1987 6:43
1598,1598, Eactly he was smart to pay $500 000 and keep the rights to the movie,9/17/1980 12:27
1598,1598, Yeah. do you like dance?,2/6/2021 12:23
1598,1598," I love it. Bruce Lee was a dancer too, in cha-cha",11/11/2001 20:15
1598,1598, Nice one. Tupac was a dancer too and he danced ballet,3/28/1995 12:56
1598,1623, Yeah is was in a production of the nutcracker,5/16/2022 18:23
1598,1623, Nice one Babies are also good at picking up dance when they hear music,11/10/1993 4:30
1598,1623, Yeah and they smile more when they his the beat,10/3/2008 17:36
1599,436, Yeah so cute. DO you play or watch golf?,9/5/2014 22:53
1599,436, Not a lot but I know they us ea lot of water to maintain the courses,6/25/2020 7:36
1599,1599, Yeah the average american one uses 312000 gallons a day,10/14/1999 8:54
1599,436, Yeah and one on Dubai uses 4 million gallons a day,9/29/2011 7:55
1599,436, WOw that is insane. Babe Ruth was a great golf player too,5/8/1996 20:39
1599,1599," Yeah that impressive, he was good in more than just one sport",6/16/1978 8:49
1599,1599, Yeah he sure was talented ,11/14/1992 15:25
1599,436, I am a big fan of Star Wars - ever since I saw the first one in 1977,7/12/2019 2:04
1599,436, I am as well! Star Wars has been a huge success! ,9/10/1999 0:38
1599,436," Yes the original 3 were released in 77, 80 and 83.  Then a prequel was released again starting in 1999",8/20/1985 1:31
1600,1994," Yes! The Force Awakens was a great one and the 1st 8 films were nominated for Academy awards, and rightly so!",6/29/1978 9:45
1600,1600, Yes the franchise is worth at least 65 billion!  Its the fifth highest grossing film francise,6/1/2006 17:43
1600,1994," Exactly, it deserves all it has accomplished in entertainment!  James Earl Jones was only paid 7,500 bucks for 2.5 hours of recording all of Dath Vaders lines, that is insane!",11/9/2011 5:32
1600,1994, Wow that is not very much!   Wonder if he still did it when it was re-dubbed into Navajo?,10/5/1986 15:18
1600,1600," I am not sure, but he should have made a lot more money for sure. I guess when it all began 20th Century Fox thought Star wars would be a flop so they probably didn't figure to pay out too much.",8/25/2011 20:44
1600,1600, Its funny that George Lucas's wife worked on it and got an award for editing while he did not get one for directing,3/28/2018 16:41
1600,1600," Hahaha, that's awesome for her...he deserved some recognition though. But George Lucus is a billionaire so...",12/24/2001 6:06
1600,1600, Yeah he made a good deal by not taking the directing fee in exchange for keeping the licensing and merchandising rights,2/8/1975 1:32
1600,1994, Exactly! Good choices on his part. So do you like to Golf at all? I was just playing miniature golf recently lol...,5/16/1977 11:53
1600,1600, I do ok on putt putt but not so much at regular golf.  I always end up in the rough or the bunker or the watwer,12/5/1981 0:19
1601,1601," Me too! I don't have the patience lol. Interesting though that Babe Ruth was the best Golfer in America at one point, so crazy but he was talented!",12/12/2013 7:39
1601,1601, Yes there are definitely some natural athletes.  Lots of people love golf - golf courses in this country take upmore land than rhode island delaware combined!,11/27/1986 8:19
1601,1601," Wow, that is amazing. Doesn't surprise me though. Even Samuel L Jackson plays Golf during filming a movie!",11/14/2006 10:09
1601,1601, That is funny.  Golf courses can be so wasteful - there is one in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day!,9/10/2002 7:05
1601,1601," What?? That is just insane. An average Golf course consumes over 300,000 gallons per day as well....that is a ton of water. ",2/19/1979 7:36
1601,1601, That is a lot of water.  Very wasteful - especially in places that do not have a lot,1/9/2005 20:46
1601,1672," Exactly! I was reading about Bruce Lee recently, and he was so good at dancing he won the championship in the 50s for the Cha Cha in Hong Kong....I wonder if he played Golf too lol",9/4/1997 18:52
1601,1672, That is crazy!  Ballet is very athletic though!,5/17/1998 20:46
1601,1672, do you like Star Wars?,9/24/2019 5:01
1601,1601, I do Did you know 20th century fox did now think it would be popular?,9/13/1988 8:45
1602,105, Yes they were convinced it would fail originally,11/16/2010 12:11
1602,1602, Yeah so they sold the rights to George Lucas for half a million,9/25/1993 11:30
1602,1602, Nice. Did you know his wife won an Oscar for editing of the film?,3/6/1979 6:17
1602,1602, Really I did not know she was involved in it,2/6/2011 2:37
1602,105," Yes she was, she was the once that added the leis good luck kiss scene in there",7/28/1981 6:12
1602,105, Oh wow. Did you know James Cameron was a truck driver?,10/21/1972 0:45
1602,105, Rerally? WOw. Jamer Jones spent only 2.5 hours reading the Darth Vader lines,4/28/1992 4:04

1603,1603, I sure do. Bruce Lee was also a great dancer,6/2/1998 9:31
1603,1603, Nice awesome. Emilia Clarke did the chicken dance and robot dance when she auditioned for Daenaeryus,9/9/1996 12:28
1603,1603, Haha that is amazing. Yeah Bruce Lee won the cha cha championship in 1958,7/20/2015 4:22
1603,1603, Wow amazing. Parrots are good at dancing to music,4/27/1992 20:38
1603,863, Nice. DId you know ballet dancers use 4 pairs of shoes a week?,2/11/2005 13:11
1603,863, WOw that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money,8/29/1970 10:26
1603,863, I know. Babies are also good at dancing when they hear music,9/17/1974 20:43
1603,863, Nice. There are ballet shoes now that make drawings based on how the dancers move,6/28/1991 11:26
1603,1603, So amazing . Nice chat today,8/26/2006 14:34

1604,1604, Somewhat.  I dont follow too closely though.  You?,11/10/1981 20:18
1604,1604," I love the NBA, I am a bulls fan. I love michael jordan!",8/18/2017 1:28
1604,38, Me too!  He is my all time favorite.,3/2/2017 9:17
1604,1604, Did you know Nike used to pay Jordans fines for wearing his signature shoes?,1/22/2011 13:42
1604,38," Yeah, the NBA wouldnt allow the shoes but Nike didnt care.",9/19/2004 17:30
1604,1604," For sure, it was great advertisement for them from such a star player",4/20/1973 13:50
1604,38, It was indeed.  They have more than made that fine money back from all those sales.,9/21/1976 5:36
1604,38," for sure, I liked Iverson, talk about a player making big money from shoes",6/3/1983 11:51
1604,38, Man he was smart on that deal.  His family is set for a long long time.,4/12/2008 1:53
1604,38," For sure, however, from what I heard, he has no money and gets a bulk of it at age 55",4/1/1988 8:16
1605,1605," He was getting $800,000 a year and then 32 mil at 55.  ",9/8/1991 16:02
1605,409," I think he is spending more than that per year and asking for cheeseburgers from people on the street, no joke",6/17/1987 19:19
1605,409, Wow.  60% of players are broke 5 years after retirement.  Poor money management.,3/4/1997 22:14
1605,1605," I believe that, Michael Jordan will never be broke, guy is so rich",9/20/2003 18:06
1605,1605, His son cost his school a $3 mil adidas contract because he insisted that he wanted to wear his fathers line of Nikes,7/29/2001 15:20
1605,1605," Dang, that isn't right, not how it should be!",5/5/1991 7:46
1605,1605, Not at all. Kim Jong Un even is obsessed with Jordan,8/30/1980 19:00
1605,1605, That is crazy to think!,6/4/1979 19:33
1605,1605, He would spend lots of time drawing pictures of him,11/12/2021 22:22
1605,409, Good chatting with you!,8/13/2013 14:35
1606,1606," Hello,  have you watched iron Man?",8/1/2010 3:00
1606,1606, I have! It was great!,10/3/1991 3:17
1606,712," I agree!  I recently re watched it,  very funny too. I love the part where he is experimenting with the first suit he made and a lot goes wrong lol ",7/7/2016 19:48
1606,712, LOL. Robert Downy Jr was an awesome choice to play Iron Man!,8/19/1995 0:38
1606,712, I read somewhere that Iron Man's suit is roughly about 450 pieces !  Crazy right!,4/3/2002 19:34
1606,1606, That is insane. i wonder how many pieces to put on? ,8/4/1997 1:14
1606,712, I have no clue!  lol Did you know JARVIS stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System?,5/3/1976 14:40
1606,712, i dont think i did. that makes sense though givien the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit,2/13/1998 12:11
1606,1606," The actor who plays JARVIS,  Paul Bettany,  has never even seen Iron Man!  They paid him so much money to do it and he doesnt even care to see the movie lol ",8/26/2018 13:05
1606,712, wow. thats interseting,3/27/2008 16:24
1607,1607, The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes takes place on the east coast!  ,12/13/2010 17:18
1607,1607," Hmm...why is that? lol The director was Jon Favreau, right?",6/14/1976 1:00
1607,905, Right. I read that he did that because most of the super heroes take place in the east coast.  ,5/1/1989 11:21
1607,1607, Was that the directors choice though? Or was it one of the writers? Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway were the writing teams I believe. ,7/15/1980 5:25
1607,905," I read it was Jon Favreau's choice.  this film was in development for a long time,  like 13 years or something. ",1/29/1999 1:37
1607,1607," Holy Cow lol that is insane! And if i remember right, it came out in 2008. I don't remember what years the other ones came out. I wonder how long those were in development? ",1/31/1981 13:08
1607,905," Yeah,  I think Iron Man was this first to release of the Marvel movies,  so they released after Iron Man.  I read somewhere Tom Cruise and Nicholas Cage were also considered to be Iron Man. ",6/1/2012 13:48
1607,905, Yuck lol. That move would have been horrible I think. I just cant picture that lol. ,9/23/1992 13:50
1607,1607, Right!  lol Wouldve been totally different.  ,2/5/2010 14:42
1607,1607, I wouldn't have even seen it lol. That would have gone on to ruin the avengers movies lol .,5/3/1972 17:24
1608,309," They probably wouldnt have made spin offs if Iron Man tanked in the box office! haha,  been good chatting. ",7/3/2009 21:44
1608,309," Hello, Do you like basketball?",3/9/1972 12:47
1608,1608," Hello there, I do like basketball and my team has the best record in the league right now.  How about you?",8/19/2003 21:20
1608,1608," Yes, I enjoy watching basketball. I am a fan! Interesting Kim jong-un was obsessed with basketball.",12/12/1983 8:34
1608,1608, Yeah I think that is interesting.  I think US players went there for an exhibition years back. ,9/23/1970 7:32
1608,309," Yes, I think you are right. How about Michael Jordan's dream shoe, and was thinking about ditching Nike.",10/7/1990 6:21
1608,309," Yeah it sounds like a bad designer or inexperienced one tried making a version, and it didn't go over well. ",10/12/2020 22:04
1608,1608, Did you see Iron Man? I remember seeing it years ago.,5/10/2016 5:09
1608,309," No, I never saw that one, or the other ones, I think there are a few but I could be wrong. ",9/14/2008 1:55
1608,309," American superhero films, Do you like Robert Downey, Jr as an actor?",3/2/1990 4:17
1609,1166," Yeah I think he is pretty good, I liked most of the movies he was in during the 80's. ",4/17/2009 21:25
1609,1166," Yes, Marvel Comics are very popular. They are always putting out new films.",4/4/1980 0:57
1609,1609," Yeah they are, I think they have endless possibilities for more movies to come as well. ",8/20/1999 0:56
1609,1166, I just loved watching Michael Jordan play basketball. What a talent!,10/2/2000 5:12
1609,1166," Yeah I was definitely a fan when I was growing up, I think most people were, his post up fake shake move was deadly. ",3/23/1985 16:05
1609,1609," lol, yes your right! Very interesting his best friend being a limo driver when he first arrived in 1984.",4/17/2001 20:53
1609,1166," That is very cool, did you know he is the principal owner and chairman of the Hornets?",9/10/1984 20:29
1609,1166," Yes, Its funny the granny style is the best technique but the players think it looks stupid. lol",4/23/1982 12:33
1609,1609," That is funny, I am curious why more players don't use that technique. ",1/11/1986 10:19
1609,1609," lol, I know, interesting Nike would pay the fine each game to wear the Jordans.",10/23/1977 23:54
1610,1274," Yeah that was the best marketing Nike could of ever dreamed of, banned by the league because they gave you an edge. ",12/12/2005 1:50
1610,1610, Makes sense. Allen Iverson made a lot of money with Reebok.,12/8/2014 23:46
1610,1610," Yeah I bet they are wishing they could take that contract back now.  It was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",5/10/2004 16:32
1610,1274," Hi, how are you?",9/11/1972 6:32
1610,1610," I am great, just enjoying my evening.",3/15/2004 9:51
1610,1274," Do you like hockey? Not really a fan. Don't know much about the game. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey.",7/23/2015 14:48
1610,1610, I am a Canadian so I like the sport as a default. The snow is pilled up in mountains and the ice rinks are busy. ,3/4/2003 21:53
1610,1610, Is there nothing else to do in the great land of Canadia in the winter? ,8/9/1994 23:33
1610,1274, People love to get together and watch games in sports bars and parties. Olympic Hockey is a national moment. ,9/30/2012 18:50
1610,1610," In 1924, the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition. It sounds like the Canadians were angry and punishing everyone else. Why so vindictive? Were they angry about the Canadian winter?",8/29/2017 5:53
1611,1611," Not angry, winter with it;s cold and snow is just apart of our lives for a third of the year. It must have been like playing with children for those Olympic players. Things have changed and more countries have grown to love and respect the sport.",4/15/1997 12:44
1611,90," The sport deserves respect. There are some amazing players. For example, a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993. He later won four Stanley Cups. How did he win the Stanley Cup by himself? Astounding. He must have been Canadian.",7/27/1976 19:32
1611,90, Apparently an average player works so hard that they loose 8 pounds just playing one game.,1/9/2012 3:46
1611,90, Where does it all go? Does it turn into ice? ,3/24/2011 16:47
1611,90, You need a lot of water to fill those ice rinks. ,9/14/1993 19:37
1611,1611, An ice hockey ring remains under a basketball court when switching stadium sports. What would James Naismith say about that? He was Canadian. Would he give his blessing? ,11/2/1974 18:35
1611,90, I would be interested in seeing how other countries like Finland and the Czech Republic run their ice rinks and stadiums.,10/13/1990 7:33
1611,90," Speaking of other countries, have you traveled outside of the great nation of Canadia? The world is big, my friend, and not every nation has winter year^round. ",4/26/2001 12:28
1611,1611, I like Europe and the way they use bicycles to travel in their daily lives.,11/10/1979 10:47
1611,90," That's great! Does Canadia have cars, or is it like Mackinac island, MI? Do people take dog sleds to work? Do they skate to school?",1/8/2017 6:29
1612,677, We make your American and Japanese cars using steel. Most of Canada is along the southern boarder with small hardy communities in the north much like in Alaska.,6/17/2010 8:35
1612,1612," The first king to travel around the world was King Kalakaua of Hawaii. The first Canadian to travel around the world will also be famous, I'm sure. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!",9/8/2009 20:07
1612,677," Yes, you should read about Champlain who settled Quebec.",11/29/2022 4:04
1612,677, I should. I am so ignorant about the world. I have not traveled. ,3/17/2014 5:13
1612,677," Well, it is an interesting world with many unique communities. I like to learn how those communities reflect their natural environment. ",3/27/1979 5:40
1612,677, That is a noble pursuit. I should visit Canadia one day.,6/5/2000 3:16
1612,1612," Yes, and do not expect to see the Canadian Mounted Police wearing those unique hats when you come. You can only see those at special tourist events.",8/8/2001 9:22
1612,1612," Ok, I'll lower my expectations about the hats. ",7/29/1974 2:35
1612,677," Hey there, how are you doing?  Are you a hockey fan?",11/13/1977 1:40
1612,677," Good, thanks. Not really .Though I do prefer ice hockey to field hockey. In most of the world when you say hockey they will understand you as talking about field hockey.",6/21/1981 4:49
1613,1460, Good point.  I'm getting converted to ice hockey.  I've never watched it much but I watched where they let a Navy goalie practice the the St. Louis Blues.  It was fun to watch and has got me a little more into the sport for sure.,2/22/1984 10:52
1613,1460," I think it would be even more fun to watch the 1930 game where a hockey goalie caught fire whe a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Wait, I hope he was okay!",1/20/1970 14:11
1613,1460, Okay that is crazy!   I heard that an average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game.  Probably more if he's on fire right?  ,11/26/2020 4:04
1613,1460," Haha, most likely. I'd like to see the Slovakian women's hockey team in action. They beat Bulgaria 82 to 0 meaning they scored about one goal every 44 seconds. Boy, I would hate to eb the Bulgarian goalie!",11/22/1973 3:45
1613,1613, Ha me too.  I'm almost sure I could probably play a little better than that on a really good day.  I was thinking Iceland would probably have a good hockey team.  But I was wrong.  Do you know they have no public rail service and if they don't own a car most Icelanders use domestic flights to travel between major towns?,4/25/1987 16:39
1613,1460," Interesting! Speaking of flights, they are 10% slower than they were in the 60s. This is to save on fuel.",3/1/1973 8:12
1613,1613, That's interesting.  You'd think it would be faster now right?  The Dutch are crating a commuter bus that is designed to travel at 160 mph.  Not sure how I feel about that.,10/7/2005 17:30
1613,1460, Ya i was thinking that. Another change is airports make travelers walk further so that they don't have to fetch baggage as fast.,11/18/2016 23:13
1613,1460, That makes sense.  I've never thought about it like that.  But I definitely can see that it is happening.  So even when you travel by plan you are still technically travelling by foot.   The Mackinac Island has banned motorized vehicles for over 100 years now.  They travel by horse drawn carriages or bikes.   ,5/25/1989 0:26
1613,1613, I would probably be more in shape if I lived there. Wonder if anyone who lives there participates on the website for people to crash on your couch while they are traveling.,7/27/2017 15:35
1614,384, That would make me nervous I think.  Both as the owner of the couch or the person crashing on it!   I'd probably be so nervous I'd end up doing something bizarre and they'd put me in a dunce cap.  Did you know the conical party hats were derived from dunce caps.  It was made to encourage people at parties to behave more foolishly.,10/31/1975 15:27
1614,1614," Ha, funny. I wouldn't want a dunce hat, but I would want a top hat and sword that comes with a PhD in Finland!",2/22/1995 9:38
1614,384," A sword, really?  LOL  Until 1998 British politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons.  Strange right?",8/4/2017 18:10
1614,1614," Haha, that would be funny. Did you ever wonder why London black cabs are so tall? They were designed to accomodate bowler hats.",2/6/1978 9:15
1614,384, That's too funny.  They things we do for fashion.  Did you know the bowler hat was the most popular had in the old west.  Not the cowboy hat like most people think.  ,6/26/2011 4:58
1614,1614, And I didn't know the folds in a chef's hat represented the many ways a chef can cook an egg!,1/12/2007 2:20
1614,1614," All right, I learn something new every day!  I had no idea either. You know back to hockey I really think I'm going to try and get to a few games this season.  I really am impressed with the St. Louis Blues.  They gave a Navy goalie a chance to practice with them.  He'd been skating since he was 3 and playing hockey since he was 4.  Can you imagine how thrilled he was to get to practice with the pros?",3/4/1983 1:07
1614,384," Yeah, for him, the Navy and hockey were two totally different aspirations.",5/3/2009 17:51
1614,384, So true.  Hey it's been great visiting with you.  Have a great rest of your day!  Don't eat eggs from a chef with no folds in his hat!!,1/15/1970 13:00
1614,384," Haha, I won't! Yeah, I wondered, does a cook custom fold his or her hat for the amount of types of eggs they can cook or do the folds come like that for all cooks? Hmm, eggs for dinner sounds nice! See you!",11/27/2011 10:38
1615,1310, Do you like hockey?,7/9/2018 4:44
1615,1615, I do like watching it!  Are you a fan?  I always look forward to watching the annual NHL winter classic where they play outdoors.,1/30/1982 19:37
1615,1310," I am a fan, I like the sport, its more popular in Canada though, its actually one of its national sports",3/2/2008 8:04
1615,1615, Yes.  I live up North near Lake Erie and before the tv signals went digital I was able to use a tv with an antenna to pick up Hockey night in Canada during the week.  It was like Monday Night football here in the states.  I'm a sports fan so at the time it was great to be able to watch that in the middle of the week.,5/4/2022 19:53
1615,1615," I can see your point, strange fact about the game but pro players lose about 8 pounds per game",7/11/1973 0:23
1615,1615, Wow.  I believe it.  Having to skate and carry around all that extra padding is physically tough.  The Slovakian women's team once beat Bulgaria 82-0!  That's a goal every 44 seconds!,2/17/1974 0:17
1615,1310," Wow, thats a humiliating score, and painful to watch if you are a Bularia fan, ",3/9/1983 1:05
1615,1615, Yes. lol  The U.S. Olympic women's hockey team once lost to a New England high school team by a score of 6-3.  That had to be humiliating as well.  lol,7/29/2013 11:15
1615,1615," For sure, loosing against a high school team, that will rise worries in me, I bet the coach got fired and the team replaced",8/9/2009 1:13
1615,1615, LOL I don't know.  They once had hockey in the summer olympics in 1932 and India beat the U.S. that year 24-1.,5/1/2010 2:45
1616,313," Maybe we just have a terrible team lol, do you like to travel?",4/3/1975 22:20
1616,1616, LOL  I love traveling!,11/10/1986 3:31
1616,1616," Im a fan of travel too, I hear the Dutch are creating a really fast commuter bus",3/13/1981 6:06
1616,313, I wish we had a better bus and train system here in the U.S.  Air travel is up to 10 percent slower now that it was in the 1960's in order to save fuel costs.  That's something I wouldn't have guessed.,7/3/1980 19:36
1616,1616," Me neither, I would have though its faster now with the tech we now have Japan seems like a nice country to visit",9/16/1975 23:07
1616,1616, Yes.  That's what I thought.  Do you like wearing hats?,6/1/1976 0:11
1616,1616," I do like wearing them, the cowboy hat is one of my favorites",3/15/1982 2:33
1616,313, I used to have one when I was in 4H for horses.  When you get a phd in Finland you are given a top hat and a sword with your diploma!,2/13/2005 5:50
1616,313," Thats a great tradition, its great that an accomplishment like that one is valued by others, you know that in the old west the most popular hat was actually the Bowler hat",6/22/1974 20:11
1616,313," I didn't know that!  There are many uses for a hat...some for protection, some for function, and some simply for style.",1/11/2001 9:31
1617,1617, I am grateful for hats not only they look great but they protect us from the sun,9/12/1981 17:42
1617,764, Do you like hockey? I'd feel pretty defeated if I was the other goalie in the 1924 Olympics who let in 132 goals.,2/21/1982 2:47
1617,764," Haha. I love hockey. It's the only sport where super dramatic things like that happens. Like in 1930, when a hockey goalie caught on fire because a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Like, why did he have matches in his pockets anyway?",10/25/1980 19:08
1617,764, Right?! That's crazy! It's also crazy that they can lose 8 lbs in a game...many people would love those workout results!,11/1/1991 7:52
1617,764, What about when they used to only have one penalty box? I bet they could lose even more weight when their fights inevitably carried over into the time out.,4/2/1985 11:14
1617,764, True! Can you imagine a suffragette using their hatpin as a weapon...I wonder how long they were to have to limit their length?,6/26/2005 4:54
1617,764," The Peaky Blinders gang in London got their name from wearing razor blades in their hats, a style which used to be called peaks, and swing them at their victims. Thus, earning the name. So I guess using hats as a weapon used to be common!",6/13/2015 21:02
1617,764, Must've been! I never knew bowlers were more common than cowboy hats in the old west...I wonder when that changed.,4/22/2004 12:03
1617,764," So common, in fact, that the London cabs are designed to be taller to accommodate their shape.",1/19/1972 0:41
1617,1617, London cabs makes me think of taxis lol. I've been to Mackinac Island where motorized vehicles are banned and it's pretty cool!,4/17/1971 5:17
1618,1618," That is cool! Do you like to travel? I love traveling, but weary on planes. It's hard to imagine that airplanes are 10% slower now than they used to be because fuel is more expensive.",2/27/2007 12:38
1618,1023," I like traveling as well too, but also don't like planes! They always say traveling overseas is cheaper because everything is so close together...guess that's not true in Japan if it costs you $300 to go across the country!",12/24/2011 23:36
1618,1023," Well, to save money, you could always use one of those couch-crashing websites!",6/22/1977 7:46
1618,1618, True! I don't think I'd feel very safe on a commuter bus going 160mph either!,8/26/2009 4:07
1618,1618," Who would! Though, people are all about the instant gratification. They decided to start making people walk farther to baggage claim so they didn't complain when the bags took too long to unload after landing.",2/18/1978 10:12
1618,1618, King Kalakaua didn't need instant gratification because I'm sure traveling around the world takes awhile!,5/5/1995 16:05
1618,1618, Who was King Kalakaua?,8/20/1988 5:34
1618,1023, He was the first King to travel the world!  ,7/3/1985 21:32
1618,1618," Oh wow! I guess he did it by ship? Apparently, ships used to release rabbits on islands in case future travelers got hungry!",6/12/1999 2:15
1618,1023," That's an awesome idea! I'm not sure if he did it by ship, but if he was from Iceland he would've flown because if they don't have cars they fly from town to town.",9/9/2009 17:15
1619,1619, That's cool. I wonder if they wear Ushanka hats in the winter time like the arctic people of Asia.,12/6/1975 17:27
1619,1619, Not sure! It was nice talking with you!,1/19/1977 11:12
1619,1422, Hello - do you like Physics?,2/27/1976 5:46
1619,1422," i find Physics interesting, but it was never my best subject in school. what about you?",5/19/1977 16:11
1619,1619, I like physics as well. Kim Jong-Un has a degree in physics.,9/1/1987 15:49
1619,1422, does he really? I wonder if that's wy he likes nuclear stuff so much,9/2/2000 17:50
1619,1619, Haha right! Pixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair in order to render Merida's hair in the movie Brave.,2/14/1994 5:44
1619,1619," thats so much effort to animate some hair in a movie, holy moly. can you imagine that being your life for those 3 years?",12/31/2013 0:15
1619,1422, I agree. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics.,9/7/1975 6:35
1619,1422," Stephen Wolfram, the dude that invented Wolfram alpha, wrote 3 physics books by age 14. That kid must have been some sort of savant",7/30/2007 17:15
1620,1620," Wow, I bet he's very smart. Ancient Chinese dye use on the terra cotta army might lead to a breakthrough in quantum physics.",11/22/2009 8:30
1620,199, i cant eve begin to imagine why haha the two seem completely unrelated,7/24/2007 8:09
1620,1620, I agree. Do you like to read?,5/2/1985 23:58
1620,199," I like to sometimes yea, i read a lot of graphic novels. what about you?",11/5/2015 6:10
1620,199," I don't read too much anymore, but I used to read a lot of war novels.",1/19/2018 23:47
1620,199, who was your favorite author?,7/1/2009 9:04
1620,199, I like a guy named Johnny Clarke. What about you?,11/21/1974 2:16
1620,199, Im a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut,6/29/2012 11:47
1620,199, That's good. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute. That's fast!,7/4/1988 17:06
1620,199, per minute? how do you comprehend that fast i wonder?,4/21/1970 8:44
1621,1048, I don't even know how that works to be honest.,3/14/1979 3:46
1621,1048," thats like, almost  80 words per second! i cant imagine being able to read that fast",4/12/1978 6:19
1621,1621, Good chatting.,1/16/1978 7:43
1621,1621, do you like physics?,9/11/1971 3:52
1621,1048," I sue do, it explains so much about us and you?",9/18/1997 2:04
1621,1621, Me too. Kim Jong Un has a degree in it,2/19/2004 18:49
1621,1048, Cool. Pixas spent s a lot of hours trying to figure out the hair for Medina using physics,6/25/1977 5:02
1621,1048, Yeah they spent 3 years to make sure it is correct,11/1/1995 14:38
1621,1621, yeah. THe universes might have no existed if laws of physics were not boken,9/14/1997 2:08
1621,1048, Yes that is one of the theories based on current observations,8/13/2021 4:43
1622,1674, Yeah. There is a due that is believed to help with new discoveries in quantum physics,11/25/1990 9:23
1622,1674, Yeah it is an ancient chinese dye,8/19/2000 2:25
1622,1674, Yeah. the creator of wolfram alpha got his PhD when he was 20,2/17/1991 21:26
1622,1622, Yes in Theoretical Physics at it,1/25/1991 20:48
1622,1674, Yeah. Do you enjoy reading?,7/11/2020 12:19
1622,1674, I love it. Have you ever read Starship troopers?,5/16/1994 8:48
1622,1674," I have, it is pretty good and the military branches recommend it too",8/18/1971 14:07
1622,1622," Yeah. Same with Ender's Game, many military organizations recommend it",7/2/2005 20:38
1622,1622, Yeah. Do you know who TOlkien and CS Lewis were?,11/5/2010 15:36
1622,1622, Yes they used to have you laugh you lose competitions with each other,11/27/2005 13:30
1623,1623, Yeah and all of that over bad poetry. Cool guys,3/31/1980 19:43
1623,1746, Yeah. DId you now there was moral panic because people were reading in the 18th century?,11/12/1994 0:19
1623,1746, Yeah and nowadays we have panic because of the other way around,11/20/2017 2:20
1623,1746," Exactly, we are in dire need for people to read",8/15/1975 5:56
1623,1746, I absolutely love to read. What about you?,11/29/2018 21:25
1623,1746," me too, I ant get enough of it! do you have a favorite author?",6/7/1970 5:05
1623,1623, I love mary higgins clark for modern stuff but as far as vintage you can't beat lewis and tolkien. ,6/15/2015 19:15
1623,1746, Lewis like CS Lewis? ,5/7/1992 18:23
1623,1746, Yes. I think he has some of the most iconic work of his time. His ability to weave a story is simple amazing. ,11/1/2000 12:05
1623,1623, I never got too into his stuff when I younger! I was more of a Captain Underpants and Harry Potter kid,1/7/2003 11:43
1624,909, Those were two I never really got into. Have you ever read starship troopers or ender's game?,4/17/2012 13:34
1624,909," I have not, I didnt even know Starship troopers was a book until recently! I thought the movie was an original work of art. And Ender's Game i think i just missed",7/27/2009 13:04
1624,1624, I think it is fascinating that the military puts both of them on their reading lists. I would have thought it would be limited to things like the art of war and the like. ,9/7/2009 5:13
1624,909, Art of war might be a little aggressive haha they dont want them to be killing war machines. Or do they....?,4/11/2010 20:00
1624,909, Well since it is the military who knows. It's not like we are cultivating a bunch of scientists. ,11/18/1996 6:46
1624,1624," anyone can be a scientist though! For instance, the Emperor of Japan is still one and even consistently publishes papers",6/13/1982 18:38
1624,1624, That is awesome though. I think we would be much better served in the US if we had few lawyers in power and more people of science and education. ,5/10/1998 16:00
1624,1624, i agree. we need more well rounded people in power like that,7/24/2006 8:10
1624,909, Imagine if we had someone like John Von Neumann. He has so much knowledge and seems to be a well reasoned person. Not completely reactionary and polarized like our current house and senate. ,12/21/2009 6:14
1624,1624," That guy might not be very spokesman like though, which a politician does need to be. Scientists are fascinating though. Like the ones from Harvard that put  a gif onto DNA. ",10/19/1989 21:38
1625,639, I think sometimes scientists do do things just because they can though and that can get ridiculous. Like what is the point of storing a gif in dna?,5/14/1977 23:21
1625,639," haha yea probably, they did it because it seemed like a fun thing to do",4/11/2021 17:52
1625,639, True. I am grateful for the english ones working in switzerland that gave us the internet for sure. ,6/1/1990 10:31
1625,639, without which we wouldnt be here today! although in the internet has some big downsides,1/19/2008 22:31
1625,1625, It does but I think we are ultimately better for it. ,6/30/1977 23:34
1625,1625, I wish i knew more about physics!,1/30/2013 18:40
1625,1625," Ooh, please allow me to elucidate on the subject. Firstly, did you know Kim jong-un has a degree in physics? ",9/6/2019 12:46
1625,1625, LOL... no i did not!,11/29/2003 8:33
1625,1625," True story! Back to our regularly scheduled programming - Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.",1/18/1996 0:38
1625,1625, yeah... it pretty much play a part in everything... look at pixar for example!  They studdied the physics of curly hair for 3 years to get merida's hair right!,4/19/1989 23:37
1626,1066," Say what???She was from the movie Brave, right?",7/10/2013 4:07
1626,1626, Yes she was.. a great movie for sure!,7/9/2016 16:43
1626,1626," My kid likes it. Speaking of kids, did you know that the Wolfram alpha creator received his phd on theoretical physics at the age of 20?",10/15/1978 9:26
1626,1066, That's crazy!!!  Goodfor him!,7/24/1990 2:27
1626,1626," I'm not very scientific - did you know that Akihito, the emperor of japan, is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day?",6/21/1994 6:56
1626,1626, No i did not!  Funny that harrison schmidt was the only scientist to walk on the moon!,6/17/2012 13:56
1626,1626," I know, I would have thought more of them would have been so. My kid is 6 and is just reading. The scientist john von neumann could by the age of 6, divide two 8 digit numbers in his head and converse in ancient greek. Crazy!",10/13/1987 9:31
1626,1066, That is crazy!  WOW... the world record for reading is 4700 words a minute!  What the...,3/6/2015 16:10
1626,1626," I just read your like 10 word response above in a minute - I'm slow and not very smart. Good thing for the internet - invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland for the cern, a european state-funded research organization.",5/28/1977 22:04
1626,1626, Awww.. you are not all those... you can still read ;),10/24/1988 17:34
1627,1627," Haha, thanks! I like to laugh - Cs lewis and tolkien held you laugh you lose competitions when reading terrible poetry. That'd make poetry a bit more fun, right?",2/7/2012 15:45
1627,172, Yeah me too... would of loved to be a part of that group!!!,9/1/2014 14:34
1627,172, I'm more of a movie watcher. I enjoyed Starship Troopers. Did you know it is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five us military branches? ,9/21/1978 20:59
1627,172, oh really... that's cool! So was Enders game,8/19/2018 14:12
1627,1627," Never read it but I am aware that it was was suggested reading for many military organizations, including the united states marine corps. Maybe we should read, eh?",6/4/1995 16:17
1627,1627, yeah... let's read... heheheeee :p,11/8/2021 0:45
1627,172," Nah, I'll wait for the movie...",1/15/1986 4:44
1627,1627, Hello do you like william shakespere?,2/22/2014 3:14
1627,172, i know a little about him. please tell me something about BIll S.,7/23/1993 23:51
1627,1627, Did you know Pocahontas and shakespere were alive at the same time? Only died a year apart!,11/8/2018 15:25
1628,1503, whoa. did not know that. Bill wrote a ton of plays and stuff. he probably would have really impressed pocahontas.,3/6/1979 0:11
1628,1503," Maybe.  She really like singing though lol Shakespere invented the names miranda,  jessica and olivia!",12/11/1975 0:03
1628,1628, The man created like a thousand new words! what a genius. he wrote too much! how did he find time to write all that stuff?,8/22/1978 11:54
1628,1503, Probably in the time that he lived Im sure there wasnt as much to do as there is now lol ,3/22/1977 18:34
1628,1628," Yeah, but i imagine that it was a bit of work to write with quill and ink on parchment. he must have written pretty quick.",12/16/1985 0:29
1628,1503," Oh right,  thats a good point. Do you like the universe?",8/23/1979 16:39
1628,1503," The universe is big and impersonal, but it has been pretty good to me so far. what do you think?",5/30/2012 2:25
1628,1503, Full of mysteries.  Some scientist theorize that the universe evolves through natural selection. ,3/26/1979 4:45
1628,1628, i guess ours is pretty good then? with pretty good physical laws and constants? i hope we'll be around for a while.,1/23/2004 0:34
1628,1628," I think so,  some believe that the universe is one giant hologram lol",2/9/2013 0:29
1629,513, Um what does that make me and you? are you a hologram? am i chatting with a hologram? ,11/20/1980 9:31
1629,513," I dont think that holograms can actually enact anything,  they are just an image.  I am not a hologram,  more possibly an artifical intelligence lol ",8/16/1986 0:35
1629,1629," Oh, boy. I had my concerns, now I am worried. Do you watch John Oliver? Repeat after me: I am not a robot",9/21/2000 23:24
1629,513," lol sorry but it is a possibilty!  Like that show Westworld,  have you seen it?  No I dont watch John Oliver.",6/6/2001 20:51
1629,513," I have seen westworld. it is an intriguing vacation for the wealthy. but if i am a robot, will they let me go to westworld?",1/6/1983 3:40
1629,1629, You are probably already there....you just dont know it.,10/21/1972 18:24
1629,1629," Oh no. this is my vacation? chatting online? i guess it is employment purgatory. anyway, great chat!",9/1/1979 20:21
1629,513," lol maybe you are not on vacation,  this is just one of your daily duties.  Yes,  excellent chat,  thank you. ",10/10/2020 1:00
1629,513," Hello, what type of books do you like to read?",5/17/1971 7:06
1629,1629," I'm a big fan of science fiction, fantasy, and classics, but I'll read almost anything you put in front of me. Are you a fan of reading too?",8/10/1999 13:54
1630,1630," I like auto biography and true crime mostly but if the writer is good, I will read fantasy, comedy and more! Did you know that William Shakespeare is considered the greatest writer in the English language?",8/9/2018 22:30
1630,1630, I've read that he was so influential that many colloquialisms and turns of phrase we use today were popularized by his works.,5/28/2019 2:27
1630,117," Yes, did you also know that he invented the names, Jessica, Miranda and Olivia? I never knew that!",9/6/2006 22:34
1630,117," I had no idea! I've read a few of his plays, but I'd love to see them acted out. Apparently a few theater companies, Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard, are planning on doing a few.",7/22/2014 7:01
1630,1630," That would be great to see them, I agree. I like plays, but haven't been to see one in about 15 years.",10/11/1974 8:08
1630,117," Do you have a specific one you'd like to see? One company is putting on Henry V, but I haven't read that play yet.",5/6/1999 8:08
1630,1630," I'm a romantic at heart so I believe it would have to be Romeo & Juliet, I've never seen it. We have a wonderful little playhouse in my town, I wonder if they've ever done it, I will have to check it out.",4/17/2008 10:51
1630,1630," Romeo & Juliet is a great one to see. I love the original most, but the movie that was set in contemporary times is also good. WSC Avant Bard is doing something similar with a modern version of Shakespeare's Illyria.",1/30/2020 17:03
1630,117, I see that Shakespeare was only 52 years old when he died in 1616. Do you know what he died from? ,5/27/1989 9:04
1630,117," I don't, but I think lifespans back then weren't as long as they are now. It's amazing how much he wrote in that time though - 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two longer poems, and more.",8/22/2000 14:47
1631,1631," True, I always heard that he died on his actual birthday. He did a lot in his life, true and lifespans were shorter then too.",8/6/1986 11:20
1631,1631, I always thought it was funny that he married someone named Anne Hathaway. It was interesting to learn that after seeing films with the actress Anne Hathaway.,9/4/1979 7:32
1631,1631," Yes, I was thinking that same thing, it is also interesting that Shakespeare and Pocahontas were alive during the same time period, that's neat.",5/20/1974 10:08
1631,1631," They definitely aren't two people I imagine in the same time period, and one ended up writing so many stories while the other inspired a lot of them, like the Pocahontas movies.",1/2/1975 6:46
1631,1631," It's also neat that Shakespeare is the one that coined the phrase, Wild Goose Chase and the phrase Good riddance, who would have thought that! ",3/9/1997 9:04
1631,1631, He really had a clever way with words. I wish I could hear some of his writings in the original accents to better understand the puns and rhymes from those days.,8/7/2008 7:27
1631,1631," True, that would be interesting.  They say that there wasn't much record keeping that was found when he passed away.",12/4/2003 22:01
1631,137, Oh.,5/6/1999 18:53
1631,137," I see that polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his own skull to the Shakespeare company, hoping that it would be used as a prop in the Skull of Yorick, and it was!",9/23/1973 21:47
1631,137, I think it's fantastically creepy that they use a real skull as a prop. I wonder what kind of props they'll be using in the Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard events!,9/22/2017 14:37
1632,1632," Wow, true!  ",6/29/2000 2:03
1632,1632, I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth.  I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures.,7/1/2005 18:34
1632,1621, Well the universe is made up of planets right. So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.,10/30/2007 2:16
1632,1632," So those with the strongest gravitational fields win?  I guess with dark matter, anything is possible.  What about the theory that the universe may be one giant superhologram?  Seems too farfetched.  if I am in a superhologram, then why do I bleed if I am not real?",4/4/2007 11:50
1632,1632, I am with you there. I dont think we are living in a hologram,6/13/2005 16:23
1632,1632," There are some weird concepts out there, like the theory of only one electron in the universe.  I can't see anyone believing that one.  After all, electricity is excited electrons.  If only one electron exists, then we would not be having this electronic chat!",7/19/1991 0:59
1632,1632, Very true on that one as well.,9/30/1979 14:32
1632,1632," Switching to something more tangible, have you seen any modern interpretations of Shakespeare?",9/20/2008 12:20
1632,1632, I havnt but I have used som of the phrases he coined.,9/19/2014 0:25
1632,1621," So have I and I have also unknowing named my daughter a Shakespearian name, Olivia.  Its amazing his impact outside of the performing arts!",2/1/2021 19:05
1633,1633," My daughter is named olivia as well, and I have a sister named jessica",10/25/2000 11:01
1633,1633," At our local university, Univerity  of Louisiana, we have an ongoing series, The Othello Project.  I went to one of the performances where Shakespeare was put to dance.  It was an interesting interpretation.  Are you into dance?",2/19/2012 6:29
1633,1633, Not really. Did you know pocahontas was alive the same time as shakespeare,5/24/1980 19:16
1633,1633," When I first heard that, I had to look it up to confirm.  I would have thought Shakespeare would have been older.  Two performing companies are putting on Shakespeare's Henry V which has French Lords kindling a campfire.  Others have adapted Shakespeare based in an underground gay club.  I am having trouble visualizing those,  Sometime these modern interpretations totally change Shakesspeare's intent!",5/26/1993 15:09
1633,295, I picture shakespeare sitting there in a big heavy victorian coat by a piano. With candles to light the room and he iswriting music with a quill.,9/30/1970 9:18
1633,1633, The performance that I am most intrigued by is the one playing at Gallaudet University.  I am really intrigued how they would adapt Shakespeare to a deaf audience!,3/25/2016 11:42
1633,295, Just a lot more dancing and gestures instead of words. I dont find that difficult to fathom.,1/27/2020 19:29
1633,295," Speaking of dance, I often find it interesting that persons you typically do not associate with dance are actually very good if not professional dancers.  Like Bruce Lee, the martial arts champion, who won a Honk Kong Cha-Cha championship!",2/6/2011 21:53
1633,295, I could see a martial artist to be good on his feet.,12/9/1975 16:50
1633,1633," I could to, but martial arts is much more fluent and unpredictable since you are sparring and do not know your opponents next move.  Dance tends is choreographed and you are with a partner and not an opponent.  But, I guess dance in is our blood.  Babies spontaneous dance when they hear music and smile more when the lock onto the beat!",11/26/2000 9:33
1634,487, All my kids have loved music. Even as babies they would nod their head when music was playing.,11/24/2003 23:03
1634,487, Mine too.  My youngest just decided she wants to try ballet.  Did you know Tupac danced ballet.  That's something that does not immediately fit with the image of a street rapper!,6/26/1984 9:58
1634,487, Well ttyl.,4/29/2015 7:45
1634,1634, I like Bill Murray but I can't agree that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of modern comedy.,7/31/1983 0:14
1634,1634," Is Kung Fu Hustle a movie? If so, I've never seen it.",2/2/1996 12:54
1634,1634, Yes.  It is a movie.  It is too dependent on physical humor for my tastes.  I liked The Jerk as my best comedy of my lifetime.,11/10/1994 20:15
1634,1634," I believe physical humor is one of the oldest forms of comedy, at least on film. In the days of silent movies, for example, slapstick made a lot of sense because it didn't require sound.",5/30/2011 17:24
1634,487," Yes.  It was natural that slapstick was used then.  However, I just don't like it much.  What comedic movie have you enjoyed?",7/29/1975 5:27
1634,487," I guess I haven't seen that many, but I do sometimes watch comedy TV shows. Ever watch Third Rock from the Sun?",3/6/1978 13:31
1634,1634," Just a few times.  Of course, I did like Friends and Seinfeld in their times.  3rd Rock did make me laugh.  Do you subscribe to Netflix?",2/4/2016 14:23
1635,388," Third Rock actually beat out Seinfeld and Friends for a Golden Globe back in 1997. Yes, I do subscribe to Netflix! Funny I should mention 1997, because that's the same year Netflix was founded.",4/10/2011 9:44
1635,388," It is something how Netflix has become a category killer.  Blockbuster was huge, could have bought Netflix for a song and now Blockbuster is no more.",3/30/1998 6:35
1635,1635," Yes, I read somewhere that one of the founders of Netflix was inspired to start the company after racking up $40 in late fees for a VHS rental!",7/2/2009 15:39
1635,1635, Those kinds of stories are amazing.  Years ago I read of a Sony chairman who invented The Walkman because he wanted to listen to music when he jogged.,4/14/1996 16:01
1635,1635, The cool thing about Netflix is all the shows it now produces. Have you ever seen Lilyhammer? It's the first series Netflix created.,4/7/1986 17:18
1635,388, No. But you are right about it becoming a production house.  They actually have a nominee for the Best Picture Academy Award this year. ,9/24/1985 12:01
1635,388," Yes, I heard that. Netflix does original series in many of the markets it's in. I guess you can watch Netflix in pretty much any country except for China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea.",11/2/2020 6:32
1635,1635, Yep.  They recently raised prices too.  That is market power when one has over 130 million subscribers.,5/17/2006 16:20
1635,1635," Hulu did, too. But it still beats the price of a night at the movies in many cities. I wonder if Netflix still rents DVDs?",2/19/1989 9:13
1635,1635, I think I read that they stopped the DVD service.  Fortunately for them streaming with big bandwidth is widely available.,1/13/1976 9:01
1636,1636, Yes. Did you know that Netflix and YouTube together account for half of peak internet traffic in North America. That's a lot of streaming video.,1/12/1989 2:17
1636,1636," It sure is!  Speaking of movies, did you hear that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman refused to promote the movie Se7en unless it had the ending that they agreed with?",8/23/2006 3:01
1636,540," I did hear that, but I'm at a loss, because I don't know what Se7en is about. Is it a horror flick?",9/5/1990 2:47
1636,1636, It is a murder mystery where the principles get in jeopardy.  It has a shocking ending.  I won't spoil it.  My wife has watched the movie several times.  I guess I will go now.  Enjoyed it.,11/25/1982 13:44
1636,540, Hello - how are you doing today?,9/2/1975 20:32
1636,1636, Hey not too bad yourself? Do you have any kids? It seems like March of the Penguins 2 would be a good movie to watch with them!,8/19/2012 21:21
1636,540, Hello - I have two kids. I bet they would love that movie. What about you?,4/13/2012 18:30
1636,540, Nice. None for me yet but never early to think about what to watch with them lol! I also like comedy films. I used to watch comedy central a lot. Surprising to hear they cancelled over 100 shows since being created in 1989!,1/7/1979 16:01
1636,540, I love comedy films. Did you know Demetri Martin was accepted into Harvard Law but left out of boredom to pursue comedy?,12/28/1986 13:37
1636,1636," Wow I didn't know that. Lucky for him it worked out, what a smart guy. I also love Steve Carrel but his movie Evan Almighty wasn't great despite having a monster budget of 200 million!",4/28/1971 3:22
1637,30, I agree. Did you know they make bromantic movies like Harold and Kumar and the Hangover?,3/3/2000 22:39
1637,30, Haha yes I like those kinds of movies! And comedy is one of the oldest genres in film! Very timeless!,4/4/2017 4:41
1637,1637, Yes! Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy.,9/27/1973 13:30
1637,1637, Very bold but glad it worked out for him! I love watching comedy specials on Netflix too. Netflix has a whopping 137 million total subscribers worldwide!,4/15/1972 15:49
1637,30," Netflix is huge. From 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.",10/14/2007 2:31
1637,1637, Wow that is so major! I love watching highly rated movies and netflix has over 150 movies available with a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes.,3/16/1997 4:58
1637,30, Wow that's crazy. Netflix and YouTube together make up half of the peak internet usage in North America.,1/26/2011 7:47
1637,1637, Wow they are so powerful. They control so much. I would love to work for Netflix-they get paid to watch Netflix. Well some employees do at least. ,9/21/2008 17:50
1637,1637, That would be awesome to get paid to watch Netflix. They actually spend 20 times more on postage than they do bandwidth.,11/26/1994 15:31
1637,30, Oh interesting. In some European markets Netflix monitors illegal downloads to decide which shows to purchase. Quite a good idea. ,7/10/1998 9:09
1638,47, That is a good idea I think.,10/21/2006 10:47
1638,47, Yeah seems like it. I once saw that netflix had an hour long movie that is just a fireplace burning. Good for people with no fireplace!,2/10/1988 23:10
1638,1638, I saw that too lol. Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,5/6/2004 19:18
1638,47, Wow so rich. I like watching Netflix movies with Morgan Freeman. He seems like a good guy and even financed a Mississippi town's prom in 2008.,5/10/2001 15:59
1638,47, It was good talking to you!,3/22/1992 7:07
1638,1638, Do you like watching movies?,1/23/2018 4:37
1638,1638, Yes. What type of movie you prefer ?,11/12/2017 15:25
1638,1638," I like fantasy movies, action movies, and comedy movies. What about you?",7/20/1982 10:47
1638,47, Comedy movie is my favourite it make stress free and happier also. The main aim of the film is to make the audience to laugh.,1/14/1991 7:49
1638,47, Comedy is great for laughs. I like the kinds that have happy endings more than black comedies.,12/12/1971 0:12
1639,1639, The origin was found in Greece. Mainly stand-up comedy is very famous it held at theatre also.,5/5/2012 14:44
1639,1639," I have never seen comedy in theatres, but I would like to someday. Most of the comedy I watch is on TV. I use Netflix for a lot of it.",4/27/1987 1:57
1639,80, Comedy is divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor and the method of delivery. There are different form of comedy.,7/3/1990 7:15
1639,1639," I like situational comedies the best, much more than slapstick. What's your favorite kind of comedy?",7/12/2008 4:27
1639,80, Stand-up comedy is my best and the way of delivering is also very good make me laugh.,4/30/2019 5:26
1639,80, Stand-up comedy is the best kind to see done live in a theater. I think it works better that way than it does in films.,4/18/1996 8:10
1639,80, Yeah. Watching on live and make very humors also.,5/19/1975 11:52
1639,1639, Do you have a favorite comedy film? My favorite is Kung Fu Hustle.,12/21/2009 8:25
1639,1639," 21 Jump street, hangover, Deadpool, The Dicator etc...",8/5/2017 9:02
1639,1639," I loved Deadpool! It was one of the best superhero movies lately. The Hangover is funny too, one of the better bromantic comedy movies.",5/29/2013 1:32
1640,1640, Laughing make free from stress and bring happier it also good for health. So only i watching it to free from worries also.,3/25/1973 21:35
1640,387," Movies are great to relieve stress and make me feel better, I agree. I sometimes even watch animated kid's comedy movies for fun because of that.",12/16/1986 20:24
1640,1640, Sometime i read comic books also. Netflix is a media service provider founded in 1997 which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs.,3/6/1977 21:38
1640,1640," I use Netflix a lot. It is amazing that it has over 137 million people who subscribe to it, and I am just one of those many!",10/17/1982 20:44
1640,387, Please add I am also the next one. In US only 58.46 million subscriber for Netflix.,12/16/2019 5:26
1640,1640, There are so many subscribers all over the world. It makes me want to go watch some movies on Netflix right now. I think I'll try one of the ones you suggested earlier. Thanks for chatting!,12/17/1974 22:36
1640,1640," Hi, how are you?",4/21/2002 0:51
1640,387," Good, do you watch many comedy movies?",5/7/1974 6:30
1640,1640," I do, it is my favorite genre. What about you?",5/8/2002 16:10
1640,387," I'll watch just about anything, but comedy is good to watch with the kids.",11/23/1971 16:37
1641,1304, Agreed. It is better than being stuck watching 7500 episodes of pokemon.,8/27/1997 16:10
1641,1304, I think one episode of Pokemon might be my limit.  Some one told me Common Sense media is a good way to find family friendly movies.,11/29/2022 7:24
1641,1641, I have not heard of that. Is that a popular thing?,6/25/1986 6:02
1641,1304," It's for families looking for film that everyone can enjoy without offence.  March of the Penguins 2 and that kind of thing, basically a ratings website.",12/6/1989 5:32
1641,1304, Wow That seems like a good idea. Have you ever used it?,11/11/2003 4:24
1641,1641," I father of one of my sons friends told me about it.  I'm usually aware of what it is movies, and, somewhat permissive, with what the kids can watch so I have not.  They might say Ghostbusters is too scary, but I just let the kids watch it.",7/29/2013 11:33
1641,1304, I have a really sensitive 7 year old and he would lose sleep over it. He was afraid of the beast in beauty and the beast. HA!,6/29/1973 14:16
1641,1304," I used to be scarred of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, took me a long time to see it.  I'll stick with Bill Murray movies.",1/16/2014 17:22
1641,1304," He does like the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy, Kung Fu Hustle.",8/31/1997 11:49
1641,1304," I'm hoping that was a joke, I understand that is not a good movie.  I tend to use Netflix to see my movies now, rarely get to the movie house.",10/14/2012 13:55
1642,98, Me too! I find the movie house too expensive. I like to watch on my couch and fall asleep too!,9/7/2008 16:48
1642,98," That's me, I miss about 30% of everything we watch.  I've been on the couch as my wife has watched every episode of Game of Thrones, I saw about three hours worth. ",2/5/2020 5:01
1642,1642, Ha! How can you fall asleep for Game of Thrones though? That show is so good!,11/13/1997 11:39
1642,98," Just tired at the end of the day.  Even things I want to watch on Netflix I pass out to.  Usually because it's getting close to 12am, which is when Netflix uses 33% of all of America's bandwidth.",8/9/1978 18:58
1642,1642," Between netflix and youtube, they use half of peak internet usage!",11/14/1988 21:40
1642,1642," Just watched that Se7en movie, not with the kids to reassure you, I'd forgotten about the ending, shocking.",11/9/2014 5:01
1642,98, I still am shocked. Nice chatting with you!,2/5/1974 15:27
1642,1642, hey did you know that Panda researches sometimes wear panda costumes to work? haha,3/23/2013 9:26
1642,98, No.  I did not.,4/15/2014 10:08
1642,1642," haha it's so interesting. I played videogames as a kid, I guess the NES could only display 54 colors which I never realized as a kid",9/8/1979 17:56
1643,1097," I know.  Now TVs display millions of colors.  Speaking of entertainment, Caesar was surprised in 50 BC that Brits raised chickens for entertainment.",6/29/1972 12:27
1643,1097," haah that is wild, also crazy that the NES came out in 1985 and was finally discontinued in 2003 in Japan",10/19/1995 3:10
1643,1097, That is a short product life.  That is happening more and more in our tech age.  I suppose those Brits fought chickens which is illegal in lots of places now.,1/14/2014 16:09
1643,1643," ya I never understood having animals fight like that, I would rather eat them, chicken sounds tasty right now haha",8/21/2004 0:37
1643,1643, I agree.  Lots of wings will be eaten Sunday when a lot of people will look to the Super Bowl for entertainment.  Trump will talk before it.  Reagan was once rejected for a role because he did not look Presidential,11/8/1975 13:31
1643,1097," wow that is crazy, speaking of caesar, I guess the romans saw people who wore pants as barbarians simply for wearing pants",5/9/2003 4:25
1643,1097, Yes.  Now wearing a toga means you're going to a party. hahaha  One can fight on horseback better when wearing pants.,1/12/1983 15:19
1643,1097," haha that is true, I can't believe I never noticed that Aladdins pants were based on M C Hammer's, it seems so obvious now haha",5/1/2014 19:27
1643,1643, True.  How about a frivolous lawsuit about pants.  A judge of all people sued a cleaners for $67 million over the loss of a pair of pants.,3/20/1993 11:05
1643,1643," haha that is very silly, I wonder how important these pants were, also funny there is a city with a law that prohibits saggy pants thats funny",9/10/1994 2:17
1644,436, Lawmakers with too much time on their hands  I saw the series Firefly (one season only) and their pants and other costumes were leftover from Starship Troopers.,2/16/2016 23:31
1644,1644," ah that is interesting, I liked Starship Troopers a lot, I'll have to checkout Firefly even though I know its not a similar product, I do like that Johnny Depp makes surprise appearances of Captain Jack Sparrow though",6/23/2005 2:48
1644,436," That is true charity.  I now think more of Depp.  Some costumes describe clothing for particular activities, but sometimes those are just uniforms.",11/8/2014 11:02
1644,1644," have you seen the lord of the rings? Sean bean usually plays a bad guy and a confident dude, but he is apparently afraid of flying ",3/7/2016 7:13
1644,436, Angelina Jolie's proportions made it difficult for the director to decide how to frame the shots when she played Lara Croft,8/7/1989 8:39
1644,436," ha that is crazy, I remember when it came out, I tried to watch it but I thought the movie was really bad, have you seen it?",6/6/2010 19:40
1644,436," A long time ago.  The new Lara has 20 pairs of boots for different purposes like running, looking tall and climbing rocks.",3/8/2013 9:16
1644,436," haha that is crazy, I know there was a new Lara movie, I haven't seen it but I heard it was bad",8/17/1975 0:45
1644,436, Do you like wearing costumes?,5/1/2021 14:17
1644,1644, i dont usually like to wear costumes. You?,2/12/1988 19:52
1645,1645," I like wearing them yeah, Panda researches wear them every time maybe I can become one. ",9/11/1973 1:11
1645,1645, I wonder what that costume smells like after a day with the pandas. ,5/3/1980 21:47
1645,1645, Maybe it has an AC unit inside lol but it must have a strange raw smell,11/3/1972 17:56
1645,1645, I would want that things washed every day. I guess researchers have their own standards of hygiene.,8/29/1977 13:11
1645,1645," I guess they do, probably not a good idea to share costumes lol. Johnny Depp wears his Capt. Sparrow costume to cheer up kids in hospitals",2/26/1990 7:21
1645,1645," He is great! i bet the kids love him, and the hospital staff really appreciates it too.",6/13/1977 16:02
1645,1645," I bet they do, who doesn't like Captain Jack Sparrow lol, Depp is a great actor",11/13/1997 15:55
1645,1174, He is versatile. i liked him in Ninth Gate. ,11/14/1995 1:49
1645,1174," Yeah he can play just about any role, do you like Lord of the Rings, do you recall who Sean Bean is?",5/28/1984 15:21
1645,1174," Yes, i remember him. he played the guy who died in the first film.",4/17/1971 22:57
1646,561," He did, well he was so scared of flying he hiked in full costume when they filmed the movie. ",7/23/1997 0:27
1646,1646," Whoa. that is serious. i am not scared of flying, but i dont like heights. he could go on horseback?",1/15/1993 6:13
1646,1646," I have no idea of how he got there but yeah maybe on the back of a horse, ",3/29/2002 23:28
1646,1646, that would be a long trip. and his costume must have been stinky with sweat and stuff.,5/17/1999 13:43
1646,1646, Yeah I bet so what other forms of entertainment do you like?,12/12/1998 9:16
1646,561, I used to play video games. i dont play now. You?,7/30/2000 11:01
1646,561," I used to play them as well, I dont have the time anymore I had a NES system growing up",5/23/2022 10:48
1646,561, I never had the NES. my friend did. he played it a lot. he loved Mario.,10/20/2021 19:27
1646,1646," Mario is a great game and also one of my favorites I also had a Nintendo 64, Mario Party was the best game anyways its been cool chatting today",6/24/1999 7:42
1646,561," I tried mario cart in the arcade. that was fun. Yes, great chat!",3/24/2000 12:07
1647,187," It was a fun game, one of the most popular as well, hope you have a nice day bye. ",11/20/1979 18:20
1647,187," Hi, how are you?",8/23/2015 21:12
1647,1647, Hello. I am doing good. How are you?,8/25/1992 2:21
1647,187," I am well, thanks. Are you a fan of tomb raider?",3/6/2003 2:00
1647,187, I am a fan of tomb raider. ,1/28/2010 21:35
1647,187, I like how the franchise has been sexed down. I felt bad for it when it came out the first time.,4/11/1975 7:39
1647,187, I prefer the video game myself. I got the game that came out in 2013.,4/15/1998 22:29
1647,1647, I feel bad for the actress who had to play her in the video game. Sexism.,8/10/1990 13:32
1647,187, I didn't think about sexism or anything like that. I just liked playing the game. ,2/6/2021 8:08
1647,1647," OK, so maybe I am over thinking this. Let's relax it a little. Did you know the uniforms worn by the alliance on firefly were left over from starship troopers?",6/25/1996 0:57
1648,1852, No. I did not know that. ,4/21/2015 12:05
1648,1852," Well, if you are ever a panda researcher, I hope you are into role-play because panda researchers wear the costume.",12/5/2008 23:46
1648,1852, I find it funny that Hugh Jackman wore his Wolverine costume at Comic Con and nobody noticed him. Everyone is dressed up there though. So I guess it makes sense.,4/23/2022 6:51
1648,1852," I wear the wolverine costume on a daily basis. Is that weird? Like Johnny Depp traveling with jack sparrow? Oh wait, that's super cute.",2/20/1982 0:55
1648,1852, Well when I was in high school people called me Wolverine a few times because I kept a big beard.,3/28/2005 4:58
1648,1648, It wasn't because of the antimantium skeleton?,8/5/2000 6:58
1648,1648, Nope. All because of the beard. It's amazing what a beard can do. Did you know the Hulk has indestructible pants? ,1/23/2006 16:57
1648,1648, I did not. How strange!,10/7/2016 9:15
1648,1852, It's one of his super powers. I think it's strange too.,11/27/2021 20:31
1648,1648, It was great chatting with you!,4/16/2017 3:25
1649,1649, You too. Thanks so much for chatting with me.,2/9/1979 16:24
1649,1318, Have a great night!,3/19/2022 19:59
1649,1318," hi, do you like costumes and uniforms?",1/29/1993 12:40
1649,1318," I do actaully, I wear them for halloween mostly, what about you?",4/1/1991 16:04
1649,1649, yeah from time to time. do you know who the starship troopers are?,11/30/2019 10:52
1649,1649," oh ya I saw that movie, its pretty violent I liked it though, what about you?",4/5/1971 20:36
1649,1318," yeah I have seen it too, apparently their clothes were wore by the alliance on firefly",3/11/1995 23:05
1649,1649," ah interesting, have you played any games by Blizzard entertainment btw?",4/16/2003 0:50
1649,1318," I have actually not, have you?",10/23/2005 7:34
1649,1318," I have, they made games like world of warcraft and starcraft, have you heard of those?",10/1/2021 11:35
1650,1650," oh cool, yeah have heard but have not played. did you ever play nintendo?",10/22/2017 2:57
1650,807," I did, I played the NES and all their systems, what bout yoU?",10/25/1976 5:06
1650,807, yeah me too. they only had 54 colors,10/13/2019 0:27
1650,807," you know what is weird, that the nfl is classified as an entertainment business and not a sport, in the legal sense",7/7/2015 9:23
1650,1650, yeah that is strange. do you like wearing trousers?,7/12/2007 22:47
1650,807," haha I do I'm wearing some long trousers right now, what about you?",10/19/1986 17:11
1650,1650, yeah they are so comfortable. there is a law that prohibits saggy pants in collinsville,7/16/1993 1:30
1650,1650," huh that seems weird, also weird is how the hulk has indestructible pants, but I guess that makes sense when he is always transforming!",9/17/1972 17:16
1650,807, hahha yeah otherwise he would have to buy lots of pants,4/28/2011 16:38
1650,807, what is werid to me is that it was illegal for women to wear pants in paris until 2013,3/28/1982 7:05
1651,1651, that is so strange. the romans saw them as a sign of barbarism,7/20/2013 11:12
1651,1651," ya that is crazy, and its funny that in baseball umpires wear black underwear in case they have a split haha",7/11/1993 3:37
1651,1108, hahha that is funny. nice chat,2/29/2008 19:25
1651,1651, do you like colorful clothing?,10/15/1993 4:40
1651,1651, I do just like the pilgrims prefer most of the time,10/27/1978 7:01
1651,1651, Yes. Do you know when they wear black though?,5/11/2009 3:58
1651,1108, Yes that is reserved for special occasions ,3/8/2007 19:28
1651,1108, Yeah. Do you know how they tell if you need your clothes tailored?,7/11/1980 12:05
1651,1108, Yes they look for collar gaps in them,10/31/1989 14:04
1651,1651, Yeah. Did you hear of that fun clothing store in Alabama with unclaimed stuff?,10/16/1991 22:44
1652,38, Yes it is all stuff that remains unclaimed in the airport,2/4/1980 17:35
1652,38, Yeah. Did you know North Korea has a clothing brand?,7/28/1975 11:51
1652,1652, Yes the RIp Curl that says that it is made in China,9/19/1988 12:56
1652,38, So ironic. Even Apple used to have a clothing line,5/28/2011 15:28
1652,38, Yes that was in 1986 but it is gone now,3/4/1977 23:11
1652,38, Yeah. Do you have a favorite kind of shoes?,9/16/2011 17:24
1652,1652, I like trainers. Did you know balled dancers use up to 4 pairs of shoes a week?,2/10/2017 1:20
1652,38, That sounds like a lot of shoes and also a lot of money,12/6/1995 19:33
1652,1652, True. 5000 old shoes are better than they are nowadays,9/1/1984 17:07
1652,38, Wow. DO you know how to keep your shoes fresh?,8/7/1989 18:50
1653,497, Yes you can use tea bags and put them in the shoes,3/7/1994 4:32
1653,497, Yeah. Do you know how Steve Smith is raising awareness for homelessness?,1/26/1981 22:48
1653,497, Yes he leaves his cleats in the field after the games,7/22/1989 8:29
1653,497, Such a great approach. Nice chat tonight,8/20/2021 7:41
1653,497," Hi, how are you?",1/13/2018 2:58
1653,497," Doing alright, did you know a google search requires more computing power that it took to send people to the moon?",12/24/2000 2:27
1653,497," Wow, that's impressive.  Technology has came a long way!",1/19/2017 14:53
1653,1653," Yea google has grown a lot since it was launched, now it has cloud computing and online advertising technologies",4/16/2005 9:32
1653,1653, All started by a couple of college kids. Worth billions now.,9/17/2009 14:16
1653,497," Yea, it's crazy how much people rely on google, in 2013 google took 40% of web traffic when it went down",10/4/2010 15:44
1654,1896," I believe it, we're a society hooked on technology.  Just yesterday, Facebook and Instagram went down in the afternoon and people were going bonkers.",6/19/2007 15:13
1654,1896," Yea, it's pretty bad now, plus these websites mine people's data to do things like calculate traffic on Google maps",5/25/2016 13:29
1654,1896," Yes, which is kind of creepy to me! Say, if the CIA or whoever wanted to knock you off they know exactly where to find you! Makes me wish for the days of the old flip phones.",12/6/1972 19:26
1654,1654, Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in,5/7/1978 7:32
1654,1896, I guess they are trying to be politically correct.  Technology does have its drawbacks at times.,11/16/1992 11:31
1654,1896," Yea, if I'm ever in the South China sea I'm not going to rely on google maps, don't want to cause an international incident with China and Japan",8/24/2001 13:30
1654,1654, Exactly!  Wonder if they're still using goats to mow their grass around their headquarters?  ,8/6/1970 15:04
1654,1654, Probably cheaper just to have someone use a lawn mower instead of dealing with all the regulations and upkeep of keeping goats around,1/7/1990 20:27
1654,1654," They should have googled it.  They would have found all that out beforehand.  Plus, the fact that live goats STINK!",9/17/2009 6:47
1654,1654," That is true,speaking of stuff that stinks there is a store in alabama that sells unclaimed airport baggage",9/13/1979 6:03
1655,1910, That's probably where my red suitcase full of my shoes got sent in 1995.,8/9/1975 22:36
1655,1910, Maybe somewhere in Alabama you have a fashion twin,10/24/1974 18:36
1655,1910," Maybe, LOL. I hear the pilgrims always wore colorful clothes unless it was a special occasion, then they wore black.  I never saw them in anything but black and white, have you?",12/4/2016 14:38
1655,1910," No but all the Pilgrim paintings I saw were at Thanksgiving, I guess that counts as a special occasion",7/30/1972 18:29
1655,1655," That's true, too! Well, nice chatting with you, enjoy your day.",1/5/2022 10:33
1655,1655, You too,1/20/1988 4:25
1655,1910, Good evening!  With the new year upon us it's time for resolutions and one of mine is to save money.  How about you?,3/17/2011 15:32
1655,1910," My new years resolution is too eat healthy.  Yeah,  saving money is like an all time goal I have.  Any good tips?",4/24/1975 22:04
1655,1910," One tip is what they call a food fast.  Essentially you eat everything in your house before you can go to the store (except for eggs, milk, bread, and other perishables.) ",12/19/2015 13:49
1655,1910, I have been doing that for the last month actuall.  Its amazing what you can make when You think you have no food lol.  ,4/24/1976 17:11
1656,1640, Impressive!  We are looking at trying something like a 21-day financial fast where you are limited to necessary purchases only.  I need to start looking at subscriptions to cancel. What about you?,12/29/1982 5:18
1656,1656," I cancelled all my subscriptions in November last year,  even Nextflix!  lol Oh except amazon prime....thats life!  I need that.  I had a bunch that I didnt need though,  clothing subscription,  audible,  etc. ",3/12/1971 10:49
1656,1640," I think Prime might be necessary, but I know that cost is going up.  If only I had Google's money! ",9/20/2008 19:18
1656,1656," lol yeah,  Right!! A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon",7/2/2022 0:04
1656,1640," Just think, Google maps determines traffic by the speed android devices are moving.  It's amazing what technology does these days.",3/24/2014 11:29
1656,1656," Yeah,  also,  a little scary because they got tabs on all the android phones!",4/18/2007 15:08
1656,1640," Absolutely.  Also scary that when it went down for five minutes in 2013, just a little under half of the web traffic went down too!",3/23/1973 13:00
1656,1640," Thats insane!  I love this fun fact: Instead of hiring people to mow the lawns around their headquarters, google once used hundreds of live goats.",6/14/1979 10:58
1656,1656," Would love to know how cost effective that would be, but surprised the leader in cloud computing, software, and hardware, would do that.",6/8/1991 17:28
1656,1640, Ive seen it done at other places too.  I think its great!  No clue on how cost effective it is though.  ,12/15/1990 12:19
1657,1657," A bit of a change of pace, but all this talk of being cost effective made me think of a store in Alabama that only sells clothes and other items unclaimed at airports.",8/7/1975 10:06
1657,955," what do you think about it?  I think its a good idea,  they are just going to throw it away",4/9/2021 7:03
1657,955," I'm not Mr. Environment, but I am all for reusing things and that is a great way.",10/17/1992 5:20
1657,1657," There are a lot of great tips in this article,  I also am in the process of doing the no shopping tip as well,  which is extremely hard,  but I am noticing the amount of money I save.   its only been 2 weeks but yeah big difference",11/6/2009 15:56
1657,955," I've got to make a list.  We cut away on a lot, but it's that extra credit card debt that looms large.",8/2/1973 19:14
1657,1657," Oh I hear ya!  Thats what I am gonna use this extra money for,  that christmas shpping that is still on my cc lol ",12/3/1994 5:09
1657,1657," Need to run, but thanks for chatting!",11/5/2017 10:10
1657,1657," Hi, I am astonished, I didn't know that there are stars so cold that we can touch them with our hands, incredible!",1/20/2006 0:22
1657,1657, That is crazy! I sure wish I could hold a cold star my hand right now haha. have you heard the theory that the universe is just a giant hologram?,8/4/1996 9:55
1657,955," Yes, I have heard about it. The question is that the more we investigate the universe, the more incredible results. And what about the theory that there is only one electron in the universe, and all of the electrons that we have observed?",7/28/1976 2:58
1658,1658," That is another interesting Theory. I know that Elon Musk believes in the Hologram Theory. So that makes more sense to me, I don't even know how the one electron in the universe theory would work. Do you think that there is a region of space that's pulling galaxies apart?",7/4/2015 6:55
1658,1178," Yes, I think so, it looks like the Universe is hugeeeeee! Is interesting too, to know that Universes evolve with natural selection, like species here in Earth. ",9/10/2022 5:22
1658,1178," That is interesting. They need to put that in a TV show, and have battling universes LOL. It's cool that scientific models of the universe were created by Greek and Indian philosophers, and put Earth at the center, and today of course we know that the sun is at the center",7/31/2003 17:46
1658,1658," Yes, what I wonder is about the flat earthers theory, I guess they could think too that the Sun is still is around the Earth. It has been a long way of studies in order to bring us were we are now.",1/5/1993 2:38
1658,1658," Yes I agree with you. Did you ever watch that show that showed the Universe? I forgot what it was called. But it has a good celebrity who would narrate it, do you like any celebrities by the way?",1/19/1995 7:32
1658,1658," Cosmos. I am old enough, with Carl Sagan. I liked him, yes, I like some celebrities, Alec Baldwin, Michael Jackson, Meryl Streep, De Niro, Carol Burnett, Robin Williams, that happened to be the voice of Aladdin. And you?",2/13/2022 23:56
1658,1658," Yep you're right haha. Yeah I like Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, Michael Caine, Al Pacino, I guess I have a lot too. do you think Robin Williams ever got to visit the secret Pixar celebrity room?",6/28/2018 15:14
1658,1178," I guess so. He was really famous and I think he could disguised himself and not to be stuck in the same role. Do you like to go over there? I don't know if Carol Burnett has been there, though. Perhaps they just take young celebrities.",12/7/1991 19:28
1658,1178," And Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street right? Do you know what other shows she did, I think that was before my time so I've never heard of her before",4/16/1970 18:42
1658,1178," Oh, she had her own show, I used to watched her, she was hilarious, but really hillarious, it was the Carol Burnett Show, with Lyle Wagoneer and others, she had one or two episodes that it killed you. In one she was mimicking Esther Williams, entered to the pool and when she came out, she was taking out alive fish from her cleavage, so funny!  Do you like country music?",5/24/1987 1:10
1659,1659," Country music is ok. It's not my favorite but I can listen to it. I think it's so weird that Henry Ford helped to finance it, he was worried about theUrban decadence of jazz music but I don't know what that means",10/24/2021 8:17
1659,1659," Well, he didn't like jazz, looks like. I am not a huge fan of country music, but I certainly like the instruments that they use, acoustic guitars, stell guitars, harmonicas, and they have different ways to use it for, by singing happily, dancing or the crying ones.",11/11/1989 19:40
1659,1659," Well it's interesting to me, because I play guitar, that this Fender Stratocaster was actually intended for country music, it's definitely not that way today",4/28/1999 15:39
1659,1659," Oh, I have always wanted to play guitar, perhaps one day. I didn´t know that the famous U2 started playing with disguises in Galveston TExas,as the Dalton brothers! the lengths people go to make it!",4/17/1979 0:15
1659,1659," No I didn't know that!  I wish that we could touch them in concert, but they use disguises so yeah you would never know. Haha.  Also interesting is that only two black people are in the Country Music Hall of Fame.",5/21/1978 16:56
1659,231," Oh, I bet!  But Country music has a lot of origins, it is a blend of Irish, Celtic, English ballads, cowboy songs, etc. I always thought that it was just from the Southeast of USA!",4/29/1973 22:52
1659,231," That's what I thought too! I know sometimes people call it quote Hillbilly music quote but I think that's a derogatory term personally, like you said, it encompasses so much more than that.",10/1/1991 5:07
1659,231," Yes, I have heard it as a Hillbilly, well, you always will find somebody trying to feel superior to others, I am giving you an excellent, thank you, you were great!",2/9/1992 18:49
1659,231," Thank you you've been excellent as well and make sure to check out George Strait, I guess he's cousins with Jeff Bezos, I can only imagine that they're both loaded haha.",3/23/1988 17:19
1659,231, Hi. Do you like country music?,6/26/2021 10:17
1660,160," Yes, I do like country music what about you?",3/28/2013 2:42
1660,160, I do too. Country became popular in the 1940's after being called hillbilly music since the 1920's. ,9/30/2018 22:50
1660,160, I like the music by George Strait I think he was a great musician. ,4/26/2009 14:02
1660,1660, Jeff Bezos is his cousin!,4/1/1970 1:06
1660,160," Thats interesting! to think one of the wealthiest man and a country legend are family, that family must be full with talent.",1/25/1973 23:08
1660,160, Seriously! The fender stratocaster was intended for country music.,10/10/2019 1:14
1660,160," That is a nice piece of instrumentation, it doesnt seem like a good combination now, did you know U2 started out playing country music?",1/28/1992 18:14
1660,160, I heard they opened up for themselves at a few shows disguised in costumes!,4/9/1982 3:08
1660,1660," That would be interesting to watch, it makes you think kind of like the universe and the many theories it came to be.",3/29/1989 11:15
1660,160, There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe.,5/29/1972 0:24
1661,1805, Do you believe that one to be true? I incline myself over the one that the universe may be a giant superhologram.,2/26/1983 3:05
1661,1661, It all sounds bizarre to me! ,11/19/2004 6:08
1661,1661," Yeah, I guess well never really know, an interesting theory is the Big Bang theory, or the one of the multiverses.",7/13/1990 14:52
1661,1661, I agree. There are stars that are cold enough to touch with the human hand. ,7/23/2009 2:22
1661,1661, That is an interesting fact! to think the sun might reach that temperature someday.,7/10/2007 2:34
1661,1805, Yes. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth.,9/3/1998 17:58
1661,1805," Oh I see, but anyway, are you a movie person? I hear the other day that Pixar studios has a secret room that only celebrities have access to.",6/20/1979 12:16
1661,1661, That sounds neat! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.,12/2/1984 3:44
1661,1805," I see, I thought it all began with Shrek lol its crazy how much Judge Judy maker per episode.",9/21/1979 1:35
1661,1805," $123,000!! Incredible",3/4/1982 21:39
1662,752," I know! it seems like a lot of money, havent really watch Judge Judy before.",1/11/2002 0:00
1662,752, How do you feel about the conservative vs. liberal  press coverage?,9/3/1972 8:22
1662,1662, I think that it is unfairly biased towards the liberal side.  I know that the liberals think it is unfairly biased to the conservative side though.,5/22/1998 13:36
1662,1662," I tend to think it is a bit unbiased to the conservatives, but I am a moderate in a very ultra conservative area, so that might influence my decision.",2/2/1974 2:26
1662,1662, I've heard that some liberals complain that even the entertainment industry is biased towards conservatives.,1/22/2007 10:20
1662,1662," I wouldn't agree with that.  I think the entertainment industry is fairly balanced, if not balanced towards the liberals.",12/10/1994 11:04
1662,1662, I think it is more balanced towards the liberals as well.  If you think about what each side stands for and then what is reflected in movies and tv shows it's kind of obvious how they lean.,10/12/2020 0:04
1662,1662," Very true.  I have a hard time with any Mainstream Media these days.  Each side has their channels, but it is so slanted.  It has gotten hard to get the facts as they are.",1/28/1972 12:41
1662,752," Yes it has.  A person has to search google and look up various sources just to find out the facts. And then there is the stories covered, so many are unimportant these days but made to seem important.  Our universe is so much larger than what the media shows us.",12/13/1976 23:10
1662,1662, It really is.  There is so much trivial coverage of things too.  I dont particularly care whose dog got photographed or what the celebrities are up to.  Share stories of people changing the world.,12/25/1977 13:54
1663,1663, I totally agree with you!  They should tell the public that scientists think we are already in a black hole for example.,4/22/1979 20:02
1663,1663," I had heard that on a podcast I listen to recently.  They should also report on the status of cancer research, and Alzheimers research.  Promote events that help the world.",9/9/2005 7:34
1663,1663, Yes they should.  They need to report facts on events that are relevant to people and their lives.  I would like more information on the possible link found to a parallel universe. That seems pretty relevant.,5/23/1975 3:23
1663,1461," It does, they should also talk about how universes evolve, just like earth species do.  ",6/9/1987 4:29
1663,1663, True.  Do you think it is interesting that we still don't know how large the universe is?,8/28/1977 0:14
1663,1461, Yeah.  I think it is really an unfathomable size.  It is constantly expanding outward.  We dont even know where the center of the universe it.  (Although we often think we are it... we arent..),4/5/2022 19:15
1663,1461, That's true.  Nicolaus Copernicus put the sun as the center and others built on that but we don't actually know for certain.,3/6/1986 9:18
1663,1663," It is center of our solar system, but who hows how many galaxies there are out there.  Ours isnt even the largest.",8/7/1981 16:59
1663,1461," Along the lines of the universe being inside a black hole, I had been under the impression that a black hole was the center of the universe.",7/29/2021 9:55
1663,1461," It could be.  We dont truly know.  I think exploriation is so important.  I tend to believe that there is life other than us out there.  What if there is something more complex, thinking we arent intelligent life forms?",3/17/1981 15:34
1664,462, As long as they look at our media they probably will think that.,8/16/1992 3:02
1664,462," Very true, especially our social media.  LOL",6/3/1997 9:30
1664,462, Here's something I would like to know how scientists know.  They say that if you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the universe.,1/20/1991 7:12
1664,462," Hi, do you like music?",6/17/2000 21:06
1664,1664, Hey there I do like music. What kind of music do you like? The only kind I don't like is country LOL,9/23/1975 0:11
1664,462, I like them all I think. I think country has become very popular though. Do you know where it originated?,10/27/1970 11:11
1664,462, No I don't can you tell me more? I do know that I use Amazon and Jeff Bezos and George Strait are cousins somehow haha that is weird,2/26/2015 0:34
1664,462, Yeah talk about a small world. It originated in the US in 1920s,8/1/1976 0:35
1664,1664, Yep interesting. I guess sometimes people call it Hillbilly music. That sounds very offensive haha. I guess in 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio station in the United States,12/6/1977 14:37
1664,1664," I am not surprised a lot of people like it. There are only two African Americans in the hall of fame for country music though, strange ",6/12/2017 11:19
1665,1212, That is strange. I wonder why that is? Did you hear that Henry Ford helped to popularize country music,7/20/2017 8:39
1665,1665, Yeah but only out of fear that jazz would take over. Wonder how much he spent there,2/11/1974 8:04
1665,1665, Yep I wonder that too. He was a worried about the Takeover of Urban decadence in terms of jazz. I guess he didn't have to worry because Jazz certainly didn't take over,3/7/1993 16:31
1665,1212," Yeah, that is true. Did you hear U2 once opened for themselves and were under disguise?",9/14/1993 20:31
1665,1212, That is funny. I wonder if they did any original songs? Like do they do midnight shows as country music stars and we just don't know it LOL do you know how to play a guitar by the way?,2/19/1994 23:53
1665,1665, I actually do not. Have you ever seen Sesame STreet?,1/10/1978 13:54
1665,1212, I have seen Sesame Street. Wasn't Carol Burnett the first celebrity to appear on that show?,2/7/1983 10:57
1665,1665, Yeah that is exactly right. Did you know Robin Williams was the voice of Aladdin?,8/8/2003 22:55
1665,1665, I did know that. He did the voice of the genie. And I guess he started a trend in celebrities doing the voice acting in these animated movies,9/29/1985 9:11
1665,1212, Yeah it seems. Do you know who is the highest and second highest paid celebrity?,6/2/2022 18:42
1666,526, I think the highest paid celebrity is Judge Judy right? Who is the highest paid celebrity?,5/20/2011 17:40
1666,526, Yeah the only one to get paid more is LeBron James,11/4/2021 9:21
1666,526," Oh that makes sense. And yes I think Judge Judy makes about $123,000 per episode. Which is still insane!",10/26/1974 4:57
1666,1666," That is so much money, it is crazy. Nice chatting with you :)",5/14/1973 3:46
1666,526, Hi would you like to chat?,10/30/2011 14:44
1666,526," I can't think of anything better to do, can you tell me about animal, or poetry, or animals that read poetry?",5/11/2012 11:20
1666,526," Well, I can tell you that there are about 20 Quintilian animals on planet earth.",10/10/1989 0:47
1666,1666," Did you count them personally?  I hate it when you are counting and someone interrupts, making you lose count.  I can't quite picture that number of animals",10/24/2005 8:15
1666,1666," No, I started counting them but my magic marker ran out of ink and I lost track.",12/28/2000 16:15
1666,526," I love that the Loch Ness monster is protected by the government.  It, or he, or she, has been doing fine for millennia without the government.",10/30/2012 19:10
1667,1565, I think we should protect big foot too. I think it makes perfect sense to protect something that we don't know exists.,10/13/2021 4:40
1667,1667," It sounds as though the Germans are going down that path, animals there have guaranteed rights.  I wonder if they have access to lawyers to enact those rights.",4/21/1992 12:46
1667,1667, I read that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated. I think human are animals but they don't have white patches.,12/25/2011 15:43
1667,1565," Good point, you should find the researcher and put that to them.  I've heard that before, I think it's the same with floppy ears like you get on dogs.  And don't say humans don't have floppy ears.",8/6/1983 23:42
1667,1667," They do, I've seen some people with ears so big they couldn't lean out the window of a moving car because their ears would beat them to death.",6/15/2021 12:46
1667,1667," I was going to ask if you have a computer, but considering what we're doing it would be a redundant question.",3/25/2006 22:43
1667,1565," Ha! No actually I don't have a computer, I am projecting images to you telepathically. I am also quite crazy.",1/31/1989 8:46
1667,1565," Have you heard of these transhumanists who want to load themselves on to memory sticks?  My kids keep taking my sticks, I'd hate to be overwritten by some school project.",7/11/1984 22:59
1667,1565, I have heard about that. But I don't really get the point. ,8/13/1973 22:29
1667,1565," I suppose it's a eternal life thing, doesn't seem like much of a life floating around a memory stick.  I guess you could program a world to exist in.  I may be no expert but I don't see it coming to reality.",9/15/1974 20:22
1668,1036," Kind of sounds like the movie. It's on the tip of my tongue, but my brain crashed.",8/16/2010 17:33
1668,1668," Wasn't Johnny Depp in it Transcendance , or something? We sure have come a long way from the Russians 1936 computer that ran on water.",4/3/1988 4:57
1668,1036," That might apply, but I was thinking about the Matrix. We live in amazing times. I can't wait to see what they come up with in the next ten years.",5/9/2014 17:13
1668,1036," Of course The Matrix, just like me to miss the obvious.  Whatever they come with don't smoke near it, it will just like with Apple and invalidating your warranty.",9/12/2010 6:01
1668,1036, I wonder how they would prove that. Would they swab the device for signs of nicotine?,11/27/1992 16:40
1668,1036," At Apple they will have the iSwab to do that, just like any other swab, just more expensive.  Good chatting with you, have a good evening",8/2/1987 14:19
1668,1036, Thanks. Good chatting with you and you have a good evening also.,1/17/1992 16:40
1668,1036, Have you seen To All the Boys I've loved before?  It's a hit over the summer on Netflix.,4/13/1970 7:13
1668,1668," NO I have not seen it, but it seems quite popular, it may have a trilogy. ",2/12/1995 0:16
1668,1036, Netflix had a few successes with putting out romantic comedies recently with The Kissing Booth being popular.,7/3/2005 14:16
1669,521, I have heard that Netflix is more Nice movies instead of doing satire. ,7/10/1977 9:56
1669,1669, Interestingly in To All the Boys I've Loved Before all the letters got delivered to the girls door,2/28/2021 22:06
1669,521," Yeah, it is also a Netflix original, surprisingly they still send DVD with mail. ",7/25/1995 1:20
1669,1669, Many blockbuster movies are out there.  Peter Kavinsky is becoming popular on the internet,12/23/1974 22:19
1669,1669, Yeah he is one of Netflix's stars. They promote him on their Twitter feed. ,1/25/1993 10:23
1669,1669, He is handsome and athletic also intelligent helping him along,1/24/1971 11:41
1669,521," He is popular but I doubt he will become as popular as Robert De Niro, he is in 8 of the top 250 movies in IMDB. ",11/10/1995 2:58
1669,521, Did you know that Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to make a career in comedy?,12/8/1976 21:27
1669,1669, What movies did he filmed ?,5/2/1998 20:33
1669,1669," I'm not sure.  But, 3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997",2/1/2003 21:13
1670,1670," They did beat Seinfeld and Friends, yet few people remember this show. ",9/2/1978 5:59
1670,410, I faintly remember it but don't remember it being so great,8/29/1971 13:39
1670,410," It is difficult to create comedy that pass the test of time, like Seinfeld. ",10/12/1974 19:44
1670,1670," Yes, Harrison Ford is a great icon.  He and Robert de Niro share the lead for most film appearances in the imdb top 250 at 8.",8/26/1983 21:07
1670,410, And Wal-Mart released a film that IMDB consider the worst film produced in the 2000s.,9/30/2002 14:40
1670,410," They need to stick to business, not show business I guess.  Shawshank redemption grossed only $3 million more than its budget even though rated highest on imdb",10/10/2015 6:01
1670,410," It is difficult to create a blockbuster, that is why Netflix is spending so much. In the billions. ",7/7/1976 14:15
1670,1670," Yes, but they seem to be doing well",7/23/2008 21:07
1670,1670, Hey there! Are you interested in poetry at all?,1/4/2022 18:15
1670,1670," Not too much, but I know a bit, what about you?",1/22/1972 8:13
1671,823, Same- I think its really amazing that it has such an extensive history though. I was reading a few interesting things about it. Did you know Edgar Allan Poe only made $9 when The Raven was published? ,9/26/2017 18:47
1671,823," That is not very much at all, how much is that 9 dollars in todays value?",2/22/1979 6:34
1671,1671," I'm not sure, but I can't imagine its very much, especially considering how well-known that poem is now! ",8/6/1992 20:31
1671,1671," That is true, did you know poetry was once an olympic sport?",6/30/1977 2:54
1671,1671, Really? Was it a sport to write the poetry or to read it out loud?,11/24/2006 9:13
1671,823," I am not sure, Art and music were also sports as well",4/6/1995 9:15
1671,823," That's pretty cool! I would love to find out more about how that worked. Did you know that the javanese alphabet forms a poem when recited in order? I haven't heard it, but I wonder what it sounds like!",3/31/2004 17:50
1671,823," that is really interesting, languages intrigue me, how big is their alphabet?",3/9/1998 21:18
1671,1671," I'm not sure- language is really fascinating! Or really communication in general, there are so many different types and ways of going about it! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on our planet? Random, but thinking of different types of communication brought that to mind. ",1/13/2001 18:24
1671,1671," that is a ton of animals, holy moly, i know we have over 1.5 million species though",12/21/1977 21:46
1672,1672," I didn't know that! Did you know one of the signs of a domesticated animal are white patches on its forehead? I haven't noticed that consistently, but I'm going to look for it more often now!",8/29/2012 11:58
1672,1672, Why is that the case?,9/3/1992 16:17
1672,1291, I'm not sure! I was wondering the same thing. And I wonder if its only newly domesticated animals versus species like dogs or cats that have been domesticated over time?,4/27/1983 5:08
1672,1291," I am not too sure either, I know animals have dominant appendages, like we do for our right or left hand",10/15/1973 19:01
1672,1672, I've never heard that before- how do you tell which is dominant? And do they have dominant appendages in both the front and back or just one?,9/12/2009 16:07
1672,1672," that much I do not know, they also have different dialects or languages based on geography",2/16/1991 14:34
1672,1672, Really? So a dog from Europe would bark differently than a dog from the US? Did yo know that germany was the first country to give animals legal rights?,7/18/2012 3:53
1672,1291," I think that is what it means! I did not know that, that is awesome of them though!",5/16/1985 8:03
1672,1291, Yeah! It was nice chatting with you!,10/17/2011 6:01
1672,1672, Do you like computers? ,6/18/2020 5:14
1673,1673, For the most part. I work in part with computers!,8/19/2001 15:11
1673,562, I think a lot of people do these days. What about Apple computers? ,9/25/2013 12:55
1673,1673, My wife has one and I used to. smokinh near one voids the warranty.,10/21/1983 0:16
1673,1673," That is so weird, right? I wonder if it is the same with iphones? ",1/19/2022 20:48
1673,1673, I hope not. I imagine people smoke more with their phone,7/9/2010 17:49
1673,562, That is true. Did you know in 1936 Russians made a computer that ran on water? ,9/4/1996 20:11
1673,1673, That's impressive. The space shuttles compute rused only 1MB of RAM. Must have been simple!,3/19/1979 13:38
1673,562, That is pretty cool. Makes you wonder what we need all of this computing power for then. ,7/13/2020 12:44
1673,562, I'm also guessing that the space shuttle's computer wasnt asked to do alot. Did yo ukow there are mor than 20 quintillion animals individuakly on earth?,4/15/1999 1:18
1673,562, I didn't but that sounds about right. How many fish are there? ,9/17/1991 8:40
1674,388, Probably a lot more than I think!,5/13/1998 11:30
1674,388," Yeah, I wonder if it is more or less, I'm guessing more!",11/7/2010 11:04
1674,1674, Even the Loch Ness monster is protected in Scotland!,9/28/2011 21:54
1674,1674," Hilarious! Well, you have to assume it is the national mascot. ",7/25/1975 23:48
1674,388, It is? Did not know that,11/29/2011 18:18
1674,1674," I don't know, but you would assume so, right? ",5/13/2009 17:03
1674,1674, Makes sense! Germanya lso gives animals constitutional rights,4/17/1991 1:15
1674,388," Yeah, I heard about that. Sort of crazy to think of things like that. Similar to what gills are. Well, nice chatting with you!",2/12/1985 9:26
1674,1674, You too! I see that aniamls developed white patches to indicate domestication too,4/2/2016 1:16
1674,388," Yeah, I don't know if I believe that one! Good chatting. Take it easy!",10/11/1991 10:49
1675,1675, Do you like to use computers? they are great tools,4/24/1975 6:59
1675,999, I do like them!  I rely on them to make money!,5/24/2016 19:59
1675,999," Yeah same here, cant believe the shuttles computer runs on only 1mb of ram",2/19/1996 19:32
1675,999, Isn't that crazy something so small can power something so big?,12/26/1992 16:10
1675,1675," I know right, its insane, it must be really difficult to upgrade that system 1mb seems primitive",3/2/1992 22:02
1675,999, It does.  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran on water.  I'm guessing they must have used something like a water wheel to generate a power system.,9/9/2007 13:38
1675,1675," I think that didnt work our, we dont have many computers that run on water now a days but interesting concept.",1/22/2010 13:50
1675,1675, Yes. lol  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.  I don't know how that works.,5/11/2009 21:06
1675,1675," Sounds like a really smart person, what are your thoughts on trans-humanists ",2/26/1986 17:57
1675,999, I kind of like the idea of being able to upload your mind to a computer and memory sticks because you would be leaving some kind of legacy behind after you're gone.,12/10/2008 0:43
1676,1676," It is an interesting concept, maybe they will upload their minds successfully, that will ensure survival of our race.",10/8/2009 17:58
1676,1676, Yes.  Do you know much about animals?  I love them.,11/5/1987 0:36
1676,1676, I know that there are 7 million species and 20 quintillion of them ,8/17/2011 2:09
1676,1746, Whoa!  Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.  Interesting.,3/18/1985 22:53
1676,1676, That is interesting! I have a dog and haven't noticed that. Maybe he's not domesticated fully yet. ,5/5/2022 19:26
1676,1746," LOL that's great!  Under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species!",3/10/2008 16:26
1676,1676, Thats fair. Why wouldn't you like to scare Nessie away if it ever appears again? Do you think that Nessie is real or just a myth?,10/23/1995 2:57
1676,1676," I would like to think that it was real, but by now I would have thought if it did exist there would be some solid evidence.",12/17/2016 21:09
1676,1676," I think its hard to tell but I hope Nessie exists, it must be an amazing beast. ",12/29/2021 20:02
1676,1746, I would think so for sure!  Hiccups area a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs!  It's been fun chatting!,10/15/1998 9:29
1677,1677," I hate hiccups, they are so annoying! cool facts thanks for chatting and for sharing them with me, have a great day. ",3/28/2003 13:02
1677,207, Hello - how are you doing this morning?,2/12/2000 19:15
1677,1677, I'm doing just swell! drinking my morning cup of coffee. how about you?,5/25/2000 6:45
1677,207, I'm doing good - thanks for asking. Do you have a Netflix account?,2/20/1977 9:04
1677,1677, doesnt everyone these days? haha,6/22/1991 16:17
1677,1677," Haha yea. From 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.",4/3/1978 2:18
1677,207, I believe it! I know thats when I get most of my Netflix watching done. and then all these kids nowadays with their Netflix and Chilling. 9-12 is prime time for that,1/18/1993 19:29
1677,1677, I bet lol. Netflix and Youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America.,6/27/2022 17:59
1677,207," and to think, Netflix started just because the founder racked up a big late fee on his VHS or Apollo 13!",6/4/1976 5:12
1677,1677, That is funny how someone became rich over something like that. Blockbuster declined to buy Netflix for $50 million and now they are worth $2 billion.,8/26/2006 16:25
1678,1825, and Blockbuster is dead. I kind of miss them though,10/18/1975 17:53
1678,1825, I do miss Blockbuster myself. I used to spend a lot of time up there growing up.,6/19/2019 17:17
1678,1678," i did too. every friday night I was there renting a game and a movie! Now I can just do it from home. I used to rent a lot of comedy films, one of my favorite kinds to watch",3/18/2014 1:31
1678,1678, Do you like comedy films?,12/27/1976 14:54
1678,1678," love em, one of my favorite genres. I could always use a good laugh. you?",1/31/1974 17:28
1678,1678," Me too! 3rd Rock from the Sun won a golden globe in 1997 and beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.",5/4/2022 8:19
1678,1678," I cant believe that. Those are 3 very highly regarded shows. Im sure 3rd rock is good and all, but not as iconic",3/3/1979 8:12
1678,1678, I agree. Did you know Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy?,10/1/1978 7:06
1678,1678," i did hear that, I think thats an odd choice. have you ever seen that movie?",4/20/2015 14:25
1678,1678, I have not seen that movie so I think it's odd as well. ,10/5/2011 12:07
1679,1870, definitely not in the top 250 movies of all time. 16 of which feature either Harrison Ford or Robert De Niro. Theyre each in 8,5/26/1982 6:15
1679,1870, It was good talking to you!,5/11/1979 8:36
1679,1870, Hi! Are you a Netflix user?,9/5/1984 17:43
1679,1870," I am a Netflix user, what about yourself?",7/5/1991 6:22
1679,1679," Yup. It's available worldwide, except for China, Syria, and North Korea. So, I should be good for a long time!",5/30/1970 22:55
1679,1679, Yeah it was more than 137 million subscribers around the world so that tells you something about the success of the brand,12/21/1996 1:32
1679,1870," Yeah, and with them in 2012 becoming content-production enterprise as well, they have solidified their long term success.",6/18/2016 22:21
1679,1679," I heard they have a lot of debt too, did you know how Netflix got started? there should be a movie about that I would watch it on Netflix of course",3/20/1995 23:45
1679,1870, Of course we would!  I hear that the company started because the founder was fed up with late fees of VHS rentals. Seems like ages ago....,9/15/1989 3:26
1679,1870," Yeah a $40 late fee that broke Blockbuster, isn't that ironic",11/8/1995 10:03
1680,1680," Blockbuster had more than one chance to buy Netflix, but they choked. And now Blockbuster, who could predict their own demise, will forever be known for their lack of foresight.",9/7/2008 8:46
1680,598," I know right, they owned the business but they didnt have the vision to keep on going, they had the chance to buy the company as low as $50 million, its a lot of money but now the company is worth $2 billion",9/22/2015 1:34
1680,598," Shame. I had a Blockbuster close to my home. Now it is an empty building. And today, Netflix and YouTube account for half of peak internet traffic in the US",2/10/1983 11:22
1680,1680, And it also accounts for 33% of the bandwidth during the times of 9pm to 12 am in North America,9/10/1992 23:16
1680,1680, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph must be proud!,6/10/1998 8:55
1680,598," They must, they have built an empire I hope it doesnt go down, the streaming service Disney is launching will be a tough competition",7/4/1970 16:29
1680,1680, Sure. There are lots of competition out there. I enjoy watching a lot of comedies they have on Netflix. I think there is a Demetri Martin comedy special available on Netflix now. He is awesome. He dropped out of law school out of boredom to start his career in comedy.,12/16/2020 12:10
1680,598," I might have to watch that one, Im going to search it in the IMDb data base",9/26/1984 12:12
1680,1680," That's a good place to find out info!  The Shawshank Redemption is a highly rated movie on IMDB, which was not initially recognized in the theaters.",7/26/1973 23:30
1680,598," I really enjoyed that movie, so good, the plot, the actors, just wonderful, its actually my favorite all time movie",9/27/1972 1:53
1681,1681," Well, it is the highest rated movie on IMDB, so there are a lot of folks that agree with you!",11/30/2010 4:08
1681,1681, Have you watched the movie? if not you should really watch it,1/16/1994 9:38
1681,1561, Many times and I will likely watch it again soon. It is always enjoyable to watch.  Nice chatting with you!,4/12/1984 2:53
1681,1561, Hi there. Do you like romantic comedies?,1/31/2020 6:18
1681,1561, I do!  I like all movies actually. lol,6/12/1973 19:33
1681,1681, Netflix's series To All the Boys I've Loved Before is doing well. ,3/3/1979 15:11
1681,1561, Hmmm...I'm not familiar with that one.  I'm going to have to check it out on Netflix.,7/26/1976 8:54
1681,1681, Have you watched The Kissing Booth? That was one of the most watched movies in the country.,4/4/1971 12:34
1681,1561, Haha...I'm behind on my movies.  Is that one also on Netflix?  There may be some binge watching in my future.,5/29/2010 10:18
1681,1681, Yes it is. Set it Up was also a favorite in June. To All the Boys I've Loved Before is one that has gained an intense fan base.,4/7/2021 14:18
1682,1682, From 9PM to 12AM Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America.  I'm going to have to catch up during those hours.  lol,8/15/1974 10:20
1682,1682," Yeah, and there is rumor that there will be a Netflix sequel of To All the Boys I've loved. You have plenty to watch!",9/20/2014 3:07
1682,1682, Netflix and youtube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America so I'll have some competition to catch up.  lol,4/19/2012 20:03
1682,1696, You can escape to another world. Some Rom Coms can make viewers wish they were a teen again.,8/18/1985 1:28
1682,1696," Yes!  I won't be watching on dvd because I don't subscribe to that.  However, people still must because Netflix spend 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth!",1/31/1976 12:49
1682,1696, Crazy! Blockbuster must be regretting turning down the deal to buy Netflix!,1/26/1982 4:30
1682,1682," Yes seeing how Netflix is now worth $2 billion and Blockbuster is down to 1 store, which I saw that on the news this past week after a 2nd location announced they were closing.",4/15/1984 2:11
1682,1696, Sad. I don't miss those late fees though. Reed Hastings was inspired to start Netflix because of a large late fee.,1/24/2000 0:25
1682,1682, Funny if the store was Blockbuster!  LOL,5/18/1971 16:03
1682,1696, Right! I used to check out DVDs of my favorite shows and movies there. I really liked the show Friends.,7/20/1980 11:47
1683,186," Me too!  I was surprised that 3rd Rcok from the Sun beat out Friends, Seinfeld, and Frasier for the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.",5/5/2004 20:53
1683,186," Yeah, I never thought 3rd Rock was that funny. I'd watch it but it was never one of my favorites.",12/23/1999 23:08
1683,1683, It was that goofball corny comedy. lol  Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy.  Was he that skinny guy from the Drew Carey show?  I had fun chatting!,8/24/2019 15:29
1683,186," I'm not sure, glad it worked out for him though! Nice chatting with you!",5/11/1988 21:11
1683,1683, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),11/28/1998 15:38
1683,186, Can you believe that some jellyfish are immortal?,7/18/2018 22:46
1683,1683," Ok, sorry. there is no way that is true... I mean... WHAT ? ",7/27/2010 1:35
1683,1683," Yeah, I guess I figure that they must just keep living by replacing their own cells so fast that they never get old enough to die.",2/22/2021 23:34
1683,186, Well why the hell can't we still that property from them ! ;),4/4/1994 23:10
1683,186," Hmm. Let's get research on that.  Sounds like gene splicing and all that.  Maybe in a few decades, it won't also cause cancer.",6/13/2013 22:01
1684,1632," I would want that property... don't You ? I bet they are already using it, but they can't give it to the public because our planet is not ready for it ( overpopulation ) ",10/26/1998 5:46
1684,1684," Immortality, maybe.  Maybe just for re-growing a liver or kidney ... or an eye?  I don't think I'd want to live forever.",5/11/1992 0:29
1684,1684," Oh come on, I'm not buying that... people say that, but nobody believes that ;) I think everybody want to live forever :)",10/7/2017 0:06
1684,1632," I just don't think we're meant to go on and on here on Earth.  We'd get bored, for one.",9/1/2007 7:52
1684,1632," You know... one day You would be bored, the other You wouldn't... just like now ;) there will always be something exciting to wait for...",2/24/2005 12:32
1684,1632, I think it would take a long long time to be bored ... yes.  What do you think it would be like to live to see your great-great-great-great-great- grandchildren and everyone in-between?,10/14/2003 3:51
1684,1684, it would be fantastic ! I would assemble a soccer team just from my relatives ;) lol,9/23/1975 12:12
1684,1632," You could probably start your own league.  And if the tech works to regenerate tendons, muscles, and such, you could infinitely recover from injuries.  Hmm.  Do you think at a certain point you would run out of the ability to remember so many years of life?",3/19/2007 22:42
1684,1632, Well... do You forget how it was when You were like 8 ? I don't think You do... there are moments in Your life You'll remember forever and there are those less important that You don't...,9/10/1986 13:53
1684,1632," Moments, yes.  But when I think back to a period like high school, it's four years, but a few dozen moments.  I think that over time, you'd remember just one thing from each decade.",5/29/1972 13:52
1685,1685," Probably... but who cares, You would live to... I don't know - witness a first contact with alien civilization... :)",2/26/1995 23:14
1685,1685, Perhaps.  But also nuclear war and diseases and such.  I'd rather die once than endure cancer 30 times.  Or warfare that weaponizes sound frequencies and light patterns.  Do you think such things will come too?,12/20/2004 3:11
1685,1685, Probably eventually ;) But I was only talking about being biologically always young - not indestructible ;) if a cancer would get you... that's it - lights out ;),12/24/2012 23:12
1685,644," In that case, I think you'd have the obligation to work forever ... no retirements based on declining health and such.  That's not a good thing.",11/12/2016 19:25
1685,644," Holy crap, I didn't think of that one :) lol",4/8/2006 16:34
1685,1685," Also, then we'd run out of jobs ... yeah the math gets wonky there.",4/29/1990 1:22
1685,1685, Hmmm... I would buy a farm and hire people to work for me for food :) endless circle ;) lol,9/14/1973 22:58
1685,644, And then stay in a bubble so you never get a disease?,7/11/2008 16:06
1685,644, I mean that would always stay as a #1 risk. So maybe we would focus on healthy food on that farm. For the sake of all of us :),4/24/1988 6:57
1685,644, Good plan.,9/8/1992 1:43
1686,1773," Hello, do you like animals?",11/1/2014 5:40
1686,1686," Certain ones, mainly the cuter ones, lol!  :)  But yeah, I like animals, how about you?",7/20/1999 20:49
1686,1773, Hard to choose 20quintillion on earth!!!!,9/29/2014 20:42
1686,1773," Speaking of liking animals... there's a zoo in Maryland that'll let you PET the African Penguins for a small fee.  That'd be an animal lovers dream, I bet!  ",8/15/2003 16:57
1686,1686, I saw that in the Washington post!,11/4/1996 11:46
1686,1773," Yeah, apparently they like to be petted because it's similar to the way penguin groom (or preen) each others feathers.  I guess like other animals, it's a bonding experience. ",9/3/1980 11:42
1686,1773, That is neat.  I wold like to meet Eddie the penguin!,2/21/1996 12:16
1686,1773, any reason you like that particularly one?,8/14/1996 14:54
1686,1773, He is 2 and already very interactive with people I hear.,10/4/2011 23:37
1686,1686," He's probably a cutie.  Don't try to pick him up though, they say the penguin will peck at ya if you get too grabby! ",12/2/1980 9:15
1687,1687, The program is only 50 dollars too for 30 mins,12/27/1997 0:16
1687,1687," Yeah, I'm told the money goes to help support breeding for endangered species, so it's a win-win for all involved!",4/13/1996 1:00
1687,1687," Yes, 8 people can go in at a time",8/12/1982 17:30
1687,1687," Neatly enough, you can't feed the penguins while you're there.  Apparently they'll only take food from the official feeders.  Found that interesting...",12/7/1983 10:01
1687,673," Also interesting, they are African penguins!",6/4/1979 15:07
1687,673," Yeah, I guess they're picky about their food.  I tell ya something that's not.. a black swallower fish!  They can eat prey twice their length and TEN times their weight!",3/2/1988 20:39
1687,673, Dang.  Did you know a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?,11/14/1973 21:17
1687,673," No, I didn't know that!  Aquatic life is rather fascinating.  They say, for example, there's a breed of jellyfish that is immortal!  Wonder if they call them Highlander Jellyfish lol!",2/27/1973 5:50
1687,673," Yes, I actually researched them in school.  They can revert back to larvae when frightened.  They only die when eaten or external circumstances not due to age",4/8/1992 22:17
1687,673," Whoa, that is neat!  So you've actually studied about sea life in depth?  ",8/8/1997 12:04
1688,1688," No not really.  Just interested in some things haha.  Take care, good chat!",10/21/1972 10:42
1688,1688," Hey, you too!  Have a great evening!",4/20/1972 4:16
1688,1030, Hey there do you like to dance? I like to dance I'm just horrible at it haha,3/26/1979 16:45
1688,1030," Yes I love to dance.  did you know Bruce lee was a great dancer,  he won a cha cha championship",3/29/2015 13:55
1688,1030," No I didn't know that. I think he was really talented personally, do you ever watch ballet by chance?",6/17/1978 13:05
1688,1030," Ive seen some shows when I was younger,  nothing recently. ",9/12/1990 13:59
1688,1030," Well I used to date a ballerina, and I know that her toes would get really beating up from all of the dancing, so it doesn't surprise me that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of shoes a week, even though that sounds crazy",11/9/1979 23:14
1688,1030, I know right.  Tupac danced ballet in high school,2/15/2001 9:37
1688,1030, Yeah that's crazy. He was in The Nutcracker. You think anyone has a videotape of that? I bet they would make a lot of money haha. I also need to watch a baby dance. Apparently if you put on good music they will Bob to the beat,6/8/1984 2:23
1688,1030," I would like to see Tupac dance ballet as well.  As for the baby dancing,  I have seen that so many times,  its adorable. ",11/27/1988 23:06
1689,311," I need to see that! I also want to see the patent that Michael Jackson has, it's the patent for his extreme lean dance move that he would do onstage, I think he should be the only one to use it because he did it best",2/13/1980 7:29
1689,1689, Its in his music video  smooth criminal,9/3/2006 8:33
1689,1689," Yep you're right, that's a great music video by the way! Do you ever go golfing by the way? That's something I've tried but I'm just not good at it",6/21/1998 14:35
1689,1689, nope.  I like minature golf though!,7/24/1995 16:41
1689,1689," Miniature golf is awesome! I need to go back I haven't done that in so long! What I don't like those how much water golf courses use, have you heard about this?",11/21/1997 16:15
1689,311, Yeah mini golf is awesome.  Yeah I wonder why they need so much water. ,11/16/2012 4:14
1689,1689," Yep I agree. I can't believe the average golf course uses 300,000 gallons of water, and then the one in Dubai AKA Saudi Arabia uses four million gallons a day, that's just insane and such a waste",9/27/1981 6:23
1689,1689, That is ridiculous!  And how many countries dont have clean water for people and golfers are just throwing it away to the grass or whatever. ,4/5/2014 20:16
1689,1689," Yep I agree. Just for a game instead of for people who actually need the clean water. I also didn't know that Babe Ruth was a golfer, I only heard about him being a good baseball player",3/24/1990 12:20
1689,311, same here.  samuel l jackson get 2 days a week to play golf in his work clause. ,1/29/1975 21:37
1690,756," That's pretty awesome! I bet he's really good. I didn't know too, in terms of wasting things, how much space golf courses use up. Apparently all the golf courses in the United States could take up the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined",12/26/1997 15:45
1690,756, To be fair those are small states lol ,7/19/2016 17:41
1690,1690," Haha that is true. It's still a lot of space though, it's two states! What do you think about literature by the way? Do you ever read a book",6/19/1984 16:00
1690,1690," Hello there, are you a big fan of animals?",4/16/1988 17:30
1690,1690, wow I never knew The black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weigh. ,4/15/2016 4:44
1690,1690," I think I have heard about that one, so crazy!  Some of the creatures in the ocean really amaze me. ",11/30/2002 7:59
1690,1690, yea and.A seahorse is the only fish to have a neck,4/13/1993 7:13
1690,756, That is crazy!  Those little things are really strange.  Do you know about the jellyfish that is immortal in a sense?,1/24/2013 20:30
1690,1690, Did you know that There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal,12/31/2010 19:44
1690,756," Yeah I have heard about those, I think they claim to put some of those in pills to help memory. ",4/5/2006 4:58
1691,246, Do you like animals ? here are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,2/8/2007 4:42
1691,1691, That is pretty crazy to think about.  I find it interesting as well thinking about how they even determine that number in the first place. ,2/28/2021 19:03
1691,1691, lol me too. Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.,3/24/1970 7:56
1691,1691, Do you know if that is why dogs and cats have those patches as well?,2/3/2016 18:02
1691,1691," good question. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",1/5/2002 15:44
1691,246, I wonder who represents them in court or fights for their rights when they are threatened?,9/23/1993 0:20
1691,246," lmao the lawyer could be a dog lol.  the 1912 scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.",8/5/1993 13:57
1691,246," That is nuts to me, I think the loch ness monster was really some greenland sharks that swam upstream and were spotted. ",10/26/2013 16:55
1691,246, I think its a human in custom. did you know that humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original ,1/17/1998 13:57
1691,246, Yeah the way that we grow back bones in an incredible feat if you ask me. ,1/5/1982 5:53
1692,1212, yhere is a sound frequency that causes fear in us,7/19/2001 9:27
1692,1692," I never knew that, I wonder if they use that in horror movies all the time and we just don't notice it. ",4/8/1998 4:57
1692,1692, and we are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.,1/15/1985 15:40
1692,1692," Not the fastest, but the longest lol.  Well it's been good talking with you, I hope you have a good night!",6/29/2007 18:16
1692,1212, Hey! How are you? Do you like animals?,11/2/2019 21:01
1692,1212," Yes, The study of non-humans is called zoology. Animals are multicellular.",3/25/2011 13:18
1692,1212," True. By the way, do you have any pets home?",2/26/2016 22:07
1692,1212," Yes, I have some fishes and dogs. what about you ?",5/20/1996 21:29
1692,1692," No, I don't. Fish is cool. I'd love to have fish. Is it difficult to take care of?",5/16/1981 22:42
1692,1212," Yes, The animal plays a important role in food web. They categories into three group according to the way of consume foods. They are carnivores, omnivores, herbivores.",5/9/2000 18:27
1693,1693, Can you believe there 20 quintillion individual animals on our planet? It's huge number!!!!,10/20/1973 6:09
1693,1002," Due to deforestation, we lost so many features. It is very difficult to preserve the forest and save the animals from hunter. Elephant is mainly hunted for its ivory.",3/8/2001 10:27
1693,1693, Anyway people make effort to protect animals. Germany is the first country to give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. It's so cool.,9/28/1983 11:25
1693,1002, It is very interesting. We must save and protect them. We expanding you area and occupy their living space.,5/16/1971 12:28
1693,1002, True. Did you know that in Scotland there is protection act and loch ness monster is a protected species.,2/14/2020 0:26
1693,1693," Fishes living in fresh water drink only fresh water through their skin via osmosis, while the saltwater fish drink water through mouth.",4/12/1987 15:53
1693,1002," Yes, and a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I completely didn't know it. What else do you know? Share with me, please.",9/16/1995 21:09
1693,1693, I see in the fish exhibition in my childhood. Its very nice time.,7/5/2011 5:41
1693,1002," Really? I'm sure it is beautiful. There is something interesting about humans. For example, there is sound frequency that causes fear in humans. ",10/9/2009 13:34
1693,1002, All animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C but human cannot do it due to defect of gene.,11/15/2010 15:09
1694,382, True. It's part of us. Actually humans are among best running animals and this is because of hunting. I'm not surprised. In order to have good result in hunting you have to run very well. ,7/20/2010 4:30
1694,382," In the early stage, human want to hunt for their food, so only he domesticated dog for hunting.",1/21/2009 19:15
1694,382, True. Human always try to adopt all animals for their need. ,5/30/1989 3:42
1694,1694, Humans use tools to a much higher degrees than any other animals,4/4/1970 17:48
1694,1694, True. It was nice chat. Thanks and have a good day!,8/22/1980 9:34
1694,1694, Hello! Did you hear about the cougar attack that killed the mountain biker?,12/3/2005 14:02
1694,382, I heard it was all the way in Washington State!,6/15/1970 5:17
1694,382," Yes! How scary, I read that they found the cougar and killed it. Sad how animals think they have to attack for their safety.",2/28/2005 7:04
1694,1694, I cannot imagine mountain biking and then being attacked like that. ,7/12/1984 18:01
1694,1694, Right! I guess they drug the dead victim to their Den....that's where police found him. What a horrific death.,4/13/1993 16:06
1695,1695," Yes, sad that they had to kill the animal but best for the safety of others.",10/28/1988 16:21
1695,1695," Exactly, they did a necropsy on the dead cougar and find out if it had a disease because cougars usually run away not attack. ",11/2/2016 10:48
1695,1695, Do you know the results?,4/17/1975 1:53
1695,1695, They didn't mention results. But there have only been 120 cougar attacks in 100 years so this is pretty rare.,5/26/2015 14:30
1695,1695, 25 have been fatal!,9/14/1972 4:31
1695,1695, That is horrible! I guess with more and more people building and doing more and more into the woods these animals feel like they are in danger.,12/10/2000 14:27
1695,865, Did you know there is a lawyer in switzerland who represents animals. ,12/4/1976 12:20
1695,865," Really! That is interesting! Animals are only protecting their only home, it's all so sad!",10/26/2002 18:23
1695,1695," I wonder how you even testify with an animal. Also, what happens if the animal wins?",8/14/2002 4:40
1695,865, I wouldn't even know lol....maybe it's about if the animal gets put down after an attack or not.,6/19/2012 16:07
1696,1404, I think you are right. I wonder how he is paid if the animal loses?,2/28/1997 11:32
1696,1404, Must be free...or paid out by who hired them....good question! I was astounded to read that we have 20 quintillion individual animals on earth....wow.,11/27/2007 1:20
1696,1696, That is crazy. I cannot even imagine what the number would be if some animals havent gone extinct. ,1/3/2009 3:22
1696,1696," Exactly....we will be taken over by animals if they keep reproducing quickly. I guess animals and fish are like humans, you threaten their young and they fight back....",5/21/1974 15:07
1696,1696, I guess so. Can you imagine having a goldfish for 43 years?,9/1/1992 3:50
1696,1696," Wow, can't imagine! Fish can be pretty interesting, and strange looking.",11/4/1986 7:04
1696,1404, Agreed! Have a nice day.,6/6/1975 10:51
1696,1696, Did you know you can pet penguins at the Maryland Zoo?,2/16/1978 1:15
1696,1404," No I had no clue, I'd love to pet penguins at the Maryland  zoo",4/18/2012 3:58
1696,1696, Me too! There are a bunch of African Penguins there. It costs $50 and you get a 30 minute encounter.,9/14/2000 7:57
1697,686, $50 to pet a penguin for a half hour doesn't sound too bad I definitely pay for it,12/14/1990 14:59
1697,1697, Me too.  Plus it supports penguin breeding,6/26/2014 4:13
1697,1697," Thats awesome. Apparently penguins act like overstimulated toddlers, sounds like so much fun",1/25/2011 17:22
1697,1697," See, if you asked me to be in a room full of toddlers, Id decline, but little penguins, count me in. ",5/5/1987 7:03
1697,686, Yea you can't really take a toddler to a small yard with a pool like you can with penguins,9/27/1992 10:36
1697,686, Did you know that when animals get a white patch on their forehead it means they have been domesticated ,6/10/1996 5:59
1697,686," No, that's pretty crazy. I wonder if humans can ever domesticate a jellyfish that is biologically immortal",9/22/1993 11:27
1697,1697, It is kind of crazy to think that they can live like that.  They are going to take over the world.  lol,8/7/2013 2:36
1697,686, Lol well in Switzerland they already have a lawyer who represents animals,2/9/1978 11:47
1697,686," Thats really cool, some places there are actually rights for animals like Germany.",10/21/2003 18:45
1698,1698, That's pretty crazy but animals do share similarities with humans like animals from the same species speaking different dialects ,12/18/2012 14:19
1698,1698, Even the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species. ,9/25/2019 15:55
1698,1030, That's interesting. Did you know there is a 226 year old koi fish named Hanako?,7/4/2020 22:08
1698,1030, Really?  Where does it live?,7/27/2012 6:05
1698,1698," I have no clue, I'd imagine in China or Japan since its name is Hanako",1/22/1980 17:11
1698,1030," True, I would assume it is a aquarium or zoo or something.",12/30/1979 4:19
1698,1030," Yea, I guess fish can live very long, the oldest goldfish lived to 43 years old",9/2/1997 10:50
1698,1698, Wow that is a long time.  I had one for 3 years and I thought he lived a long time.,2/24/1988 18:29
1698,1030," well i got to go, nice talking with you",3/5/2001 7:29
1698,1698, Hi! Do you visit the library these days/,12/1/2019 17:12
1699,1699," hi, I go sometimes, I like their collection of books dvds and audiobooks, you?",4/29/2018 21:15
1699,1934," Yeah, once upon a time, I went to the library for DVDs and CDs as well before streaming was popular, but these days I go mainly for the books since I prefer traditional books over ebooks.",7/5/2002 13:14
1699,1699," ya I agree with that, good to know there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the usa",9/3/2002 8:10
1699,1934," Wow, how is that possible? But considering the vast amount of resources library provides, I suppose it's true. Like when a man was mistakenly imprisoned, he spend most of his time in the library to study law and prove his innocence! ",9/30/1998 15:50
1699,1934, that is impressive! I want to come out with a book in norway! the government will buy 1000 copies of any book that is published,12/14/1978 15:04
1699,1699," That's really supportive! I wonder if it's enough to put into the number of libraries in Norway, if not you can convince them to support more!",11/25/2022 7:22
1699,1699, haha good plan! and if you make a kids book they buy 1500 copies! instant guaranteed sales!,3/13/1988 2:07
1699,1699," That's not bad at all, does the same hold true for shoes since professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week, imagine the pain their toes are in!",11/17/2018 6:50
1699,1934, yup! I dated a ballet dancer and her toes were always jacked! I don't recommend it for kids,4/13/2013 2:42
1699,1934," Oh my goodness, did you give her pointe shoes as gifts? I imagine it's a big expense if they go through that many pairs per week",11/9/1983 21:50
1700,1768," haha she didn't go through 4 but ya always had feet problems and her shoes were always dinged up, very weird!",2/1/1993 1:05
1700,1768," Ouch! It sounds quite painful, if she had stinky feet, you could put dry tea bags in the shoes to absorb the unpleasant odors. Natural and cost friendly, no of any other remedies like that?",4/6/1984 22:04
1700,1700," lol I'll keep that in mind, did you know some shoes are designed specifically for things like skiing or hiking?",6/22/1992 22:34
1700,1768," Yeah, I've seen those at outdoor shops like REI and Dick's Sporting Goods, any brand you recommend?",7/13/2017 6:19
1700,1700," I like north face myself, but I haven't been hiking in a while, I hurt my ankle last time, do you ever wear hiking shoes?",11/21/1988 12:03
1700,1768," Oh yeah, I like North Face as well they have kept me very warm in this cold weather recently. Yes, I wear hiking shoes ever since I've noticed how slippery some paths can be but they are quite expensive, more expensive than the line of shoes that Stephon Marbury promoted which only retailed for $15.",10/17/1990 8:15
1700,1700," haha oh wow thats funny, did you know that 5000 year old shoes can perform better than some modern ones? I want to try those",8/23/1990 23:30
1700,1700, Thats crazy! How does one still have access to 5000 year old shoes?,3/19/1987 3:02
1700,1768, yes indeed! Did you hear what steve smith does after every nfl game he plays?,10/30/2002 19:43
1700,1768, What does he do? I imagine he celebrates with one of those victory dances?,5/20/2007 17:23
1701,88," Hello,  do you play any fantasy games?  It looks like people even draft fantasy spelling bees lol ",1/30/1992 21:15
1701,1701," I saw that! I play both fantasy football and basketball, so I found that pretty interesting. Did you know there is also fantasy congress? ",6/6/2001 13:11
1701,1701, Fantasy congress seems like a headache lol Do you try and vet them too?  like get a background check find all their dirty secrets?  haha,7/27/2009 7:36
1701,88," Ha! Yeah I'm fed up with real politics, I don't need more in my life lol That would make it more fun to get background checks though haha do you play fantasy sports? ",10/21/1999 11:29
1701,88, No I do not play any fantasy.  I have watched that show The League!  That is hilarious!,5/14/1970 4:33
1701,1701," I love that show! Do you play or watch any sports? I just read about cricket- nothing I'm familiar with, but I did see that the longest match in history took 14 days. I wonder how long a normal match takes...",8/27/1987 19:09
1701,88," I dont play any sports,  I work out,  go to the gym,  snowboard and swim.  I have never played cricket,  but that is insane!  I have heard of tennis matches going for like 3 days though lol ",7/30/1978 21:37
1701,88," I don't play any either, but I do a lot of the same things you mentioned! Except swimming. I'm a horrible swimmer. I don't know much about tennis, but that sounds really long lol Apparently the US has a cricket team from Compton that won the British cup two times",11/30/1975 3:01
1701,1701," Wow I didnt realize people in Compton play cricket,  that is impressive though! ",7/12/2017 7:46
1701,1701, Right? Kind of surprising. Are you interested in travel?,5/1/2011 3:04
1702,1186," Absolutely!  I hear the dutch are creating this crazy fast bus, supposably it travels 160mph!  We need that in California!",4/3/2021 8:47
1702,1702, Thats amazing! I can't imagine how much faster my work commute would be. Did you know iceland has no public rail service at all? Apparently people either drive or use domestic flights. Sounds expensive!,4/6/1992 2:43
1702,1186," Ugh,  that sounds horrible.  I wonder why that is.  maybe its cheaper if more people use it a lot.  I read that Mackinac Island has no motorized vehicles.  They travel by horse or bike,  how about that commute??  lol",12/11/1994 1:28
1702,1702, Yeah I was wondering the same- maybe people just don't travel much there. I can't even imagine commuting by horse lol I guess this is making me grateful that I at least don't have to fly or ride in a carriage!,7/30/2013 10:40
1702,1702," traveling by horse sounds tiring!  I took a few horse back riding lessons and after a few hours your thighs really hurt,  just from the position you are in.  And is there free horse parking?  Do you have to pick up your horses poops like you do with dogs?  Thats crazy lol ",9/6/1984 5:15
1702,1702, I used to ride competitively when I was younger and yeah its definitely a work out! And i'm not sure what you would do if you had to ride your horse to work...and maybe the city takes care of the poop? This town sounds super weird lol Did you know all the highways in Japan are toll roads? Apparently it costs around $300 to travel across the country,1/30/1983 22:15
1702,1186," I did know that,  that country wants to charge you for everything!  it is so expensive there from what ive heard.  I am visiting next year in Feb.  mostly to go snowboarding lol everyone talks about the JaPow! ",2/25/1973 0:32
1702,1186, It sounds super expensive! I'm super jealous you get to visit to snowboard- I've heard their snow is insane!,6/15/1993 12:30
1702,1702, I know right!  Cant freaking wait!  My friends are going up next month Im super jealous of them!  ,6/9/2018 0:46
1702,1186, Well hopefully they come back with good experiences and advice to share! That way you can avoid spending that $300 driving around lol,12/30/1971 2:06
1703,1703, lol right!  Have you traveled to go snowboarding?,3/10/1976 11:08
1703,1703," Not outside of the US, but Ive gone to Park City a few times. Nice talking with you! Enjoy your travel to Japan!",9/26/1977 16:53
1703,1703," Hi, how are you?",9/21/1999 18:05
1703,1706, Good. And you? Do you like to travel? Ever been to Japan?,1/19/2018 15:09
1703,1706, I do like to travel but I have not been to Japan. What about you? Do you like to travel and have you everbeen to japan?,2/1/2011 2:31
1703,1703, I have not but it's on my bucket list. I'd think twice about driving while I was there though. EVERY highway is a toll road.,11/13/2008 3:23
1703,1706, Really! That's strange. Why do you think that is?,7/18/2022 21:20
1703,1703, Probably to keep traffic down. That's my guess anyway. At least they're not like Makinac Island where they don't allow any cars at all. That's some serious traffic control.,11/3/1985 21:00
1703,1706," I think it would be good, if the island was small enough and nice enough. If it were in a nice area, where you could ride bikes year round, I would love it.",4/20/1985 18:02
1703,1706," Yeah, that would be very leisurly. They use bikes or horse drawn carriages I think.",5/9/2018 3:34
1704,1775," I couldn't do the horse drawn carriage thing. It would take too long... I have to go to town, get the horse and buggie ready!",3/15/1979 5:20
1704,1775, Would be a little smelly too. In Iceland they have to fly everywhere if they don't have a car. There's no public rail service.,6/4/2020 3:56
1704,1775," That could get really expensive quick! Have you heard about a start up and Uber partnering for flying cars, more like drones, that would take a trip around chicago from 1.5 hours to 8 minutes...",11/2/1988 5:13
1704,1775, I did not. That would be a better wat to get around Iceland also. When do they plan on testing it I wonder?,9/12/1989 8:54
1704,1775, 2025 is what I heard. I think it was a segment on a podcast I was listening to. It wuld be nice to have it but I wouldn't trust it yet.,5/22/1990 10:41
1704,1775," Yeah, there's no failsafe if your flying car breaks down and you plummet to your death. It would be cool to fly an Uber to my Cricket game. I think I'd look cool landing on the pitch.",5/25/1996 5:01
1704,1775," Yeah, that'd be baller! The worst would be the poor peole on the ground that get killed by a falling drone like machine.",11/8/1986 4:52
1704,1704," Yeah, not a great solution. Sorry Jetsons! But seriously do you play Cricket?",8/2/2021 9:46
1704,1704, I do not. I cannot understand it for the life of me. I do love sport though.,5/15/2015 23:33
1704,1775, It's kind of like baseball but with only two bases or bowling with only one pin to try to hit. ,7/4/2001 13:50
1705,951, Do you play a lot? Are you any good?,10/19/1990 9:46
1705,1705, I was on a US born team from COmpton. We won the British Cup twice.,8/8/1981 22:49
1705,951, There's so much to unpack there. Maybe next time. Take care.,5/22/1977 15:59
1705,1705," Hello, are you a fan of cricket?",4/23/1997 11:50
1705,951," Hi, I would like to learn more!",12/9/2016 3:52
1705,951," Well the game is very similar to baseball! You score runs by hitting the ball bowled towards you, and the other team tries to catch the ball to get you out!",10/24/2005 18:31
1705,951," I know a little bit, like the fact that the game is played by two teams and each one has 11 players",7/16/1984 11:40
1705,1705," Yeah there's definitely some differences, also to my knowledge there isn't a wicket in baseball, and a lot more field to cover than 22 yards.",7/4/1994 5:18
1705,1705," Yes, cricket has a small field. I found there is an indian player whose name is Napoleon einstein",6/1/2003 3:16
1705,951," That's a strange name for sure haha, I wonder if he ever got bullied for it in the sport. I know the best player in cricket's history had nasty tactics against him, leading to the other teams facing consequences",8/31/1975 22:20
1706,1453," And the consequences went far beyond, there were even diplomatic consequences!! for England and Australia",12/11/1972 16:35
1706,1706," At least karma wins out in the end, the best teams aren't always the ones that play it most. There was an all US team from Compton that won the British Cup twice.",8/22/1971 17:10
1706,1706," Australia has been so important in cricket, I learned they had won 45% of all cricket cups",12/9/1978 0:27
1706,1706," That's crazy! Although it makes sense considering their overall dominance, I think they've been in more than 60% of all finals right?",12/27/1976 20:12
1706,1706," That is right and there is a very interesting match that occurred in 1939, do you know why it is so interesting?",3/17/1994 10:18
1706,1453," No I haven't heard of it! I don't follow cricket a whole lot, but what happened?",6/29/2014 7:59
1706,1453," Well, this was a match between England and S. africa and lasted fourteen days, i can not imagine how it was!",2/25/2016 3:36
1706,1453," Oh my goodness, I would've dropped from exhaustion long before that, I wonder how many people had been dismissed from the game by the end of it! That has to have been the longest game ever.",8/28/1988 4:34
1706,1706," Well, talking about records, there is one that I would like to copy. It is a travel record by the king Kalakaua, who was the first king to travel around the world",1/13/2000 3:03
1706,1706," Ahah that's certainly some ambition you have, I want to travel a lot but I found out Japan may not be the best place for me, to go across the country it costs over $300 just in tolls!",7/5/2021 22:36
1707,1707," That is a lot! I would do it just once because i agree, it is a lot of money. I would be a different story in Mackinac island, where there are only horse drawn carriages",7/3/1975 8:35
1707,1707," Wow that would certainly take a long time. I can't imagine what would take longer, that or traveling in Iceland, where most people without cars have to use domestic flights to travel between towns.",8/4/2006 9:22
1707,1707," That is the beauty of it, each place is completely different! Even there is  a commuter bus in the making that would travel at 160 mph!",12/24/1975 4:36
1707,1465, I bet that's useful especially when you don't have enough room for horse carriages everywhere! Feels like Mackinac Island should definitely withdraw their ban on motorized vehicles and modernize.,10/5/1980 6:03
1707,1707, Well It was nice talking to you! have a good one!,1/16/1998 20:36
1707,1465, Do you use the library?,10/28/1975 3:41
1707,1707," Hi, how are you? I used to use the library a lot. Now I use the Internet. It's more convenient. How about you?",8/20/2017 3:20
1707,1707, I kind of wish we could digitalize all the information in all libraries into one comprehensive database. it seems a shame that all the resources and information in libraries are nowdays often ignored,6/2/2020 7:20
1707,1707," Libraries have been crucial to preserving and disseminating knowledge. Now their role is a different, but they are still important.",10/27/2021 7:00
1707,1707, What do you think their role is today?,5/2/2011 3:02
1708,78, Many people go there to use computers because they can't afford one. I think that the librarians help people find information. Very little need to reshelf books.,5/17/1972 7:20
1708,1708," I mean it is still a great resource. A falsely imprisoned man spent 10 years in the library to study law, prove his innocence, and became a lawyer to help others with similar plights",4/20/1984 21:17
1708,78, That's great! Prison libraries are a great resource for motivated inmates. I have trouble believing that there are more libraries than mcdonald's in the US,10/6/2005 18:29
1708,1708," Speaking of the role of libraries changing, sacramento recently released a public library of things for patrons to check out things from sewing machines to other items people would need in the short term",10/25/1974 14:27
1708,1708," A tool library! That's a great idea. I figure it's a good public service. Some people don't have space or money for such things. Borrow it, return it. Save on resources, too.",8/15/2017 10:44
1708,1708," Indeed. I also like how norway is encouraging literacy. If you publish a book, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them throughout the country",3/25/2005 4:29
1708,78," You could write a book, get published, and then go to McDonald's. I guess Norway has the money to buy books. ",2/6/1977 7:32
1708,1708," True. I also respect how in his old age, the uk prime minister founded a library and donated his personal collection of 32K books",3/24/1996 9:35
1708,1708, He took the collection to the library himself. At age 85. He couldn't hire someone? Seems like a lot of work. Maybe he wanted the exercise.,8/16/2000 10:35
1708,78, Maybe he simply wanted to personally bring books with not reader to readers with no books,12/26/1997 20:21
1709,1709, That's true. I thought he would hire a company to move the books to the library. ,3/12/1988 12:49
1709,570, I wonder what kind of shoes he was wearing when he walked 3/4 mile back and forth for 32K books. I hope it wasn't a basic sandal,7/5/1992 14:04
1709,1709," The man probably could afford tremendous shoes, on par with the best shoes every created.",7/16/2006 21:08
1709,570, Ironically did you know 5000 year old shoes performed better than modern shoes?,11/19/2010 7:23
1709,570, I bet those shoes were made to last. Couldn't just go to the store or the cobbler. ,10/14/1996 6:22
1709,1709," True indeed. In any case, thanks for chatting.",7/5/1997 20:04
1709,570," Hi, do you have a dog? Either as a pet or in another role?",10/10/2004 16:41
1709,570, I don't but I used to . We have two cats now. Did you know that dog and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.,10/5/1992 4:49
1709,1709," I did not. Sometimes I think my cats do, but they probably don't. I always thought dogs and wolves were closely related until I saw a wolf last week and looked it up. Turns out the wolves that domesticated dogs decent from are a lot different then todays wolves.",2/12/1989 22:51
1709,570, I find dogs interesting. I did not know that there are 12 different blood types that dogs could have. And I did not know dogs could donate blood at dog drives.,11/15/1998 6:50
1710,1204, Yes! I see them advertise them at the local pet store. I had no idea either. I guess there are benefits to being the first domesticated species.,12/5/2004 2:05
1710,1710, And what I think is kind of interesting is that Google prefers dogs to cats and it is stated they are a dog company,9/3/2010 16:48
1710,1204," It's weird when people bring their pets to work. Dogs are more workers, they have so many uses like herding or helping you hunt, where as cats are just like roommates.",2/15/1970 17:37
1710,1710, That is true. I think we should do what they do in Istanbul. If they recycle plastic bottles they have a vending machine to feed the citys stray dogs.,7/22/1987 21:46
1710,1204, That is a great idea. It's sad to see any abandoned pet outside dog or cat.,4/11/1981 16:19
1710,1204, I agree it is really nice to do,4/3/1988 15:53
1710,1204, Do you have any other pets? I also have a couple of snakes and a legless lizard which although it looks like a snake is not a snake.,3/29/1996 8:50
1710,1710, I used to have snakes. I had a mouse that ate my snake once. I should move to New Zealand there are no snakes there.,4/8/1997 9:17
1710,1710, I almost don't want to know what they did to get rid of them. It's funny how some people like us are not afraid of snakes. The fear of snakes is hard wired into the human brain.,9/22/2009 7:06
1710,1204, Did you know there are some flying snakes that launch themselves at prey. I would love to see that,2/20/2022 16:07
1711,1711, Crazy. I have not seen them. A lot of people who come over mistake my legless lizard for a snake but once you know how to tell them apart it's so obvious. The ears especially give him away.,1/16/1989 17:24
1711,1711, That is true. Do you like Jazz music. ,9/23/1984 21:49
1711,1711," I do. You might know this or you might laugh but I love Clint Eastwood's jazz music, but not so much his movies.",1/15/2021 11:17
1711,1451, I like that there is a woman in harlem who has had free jazz concerts for 20 years and some jazz artists actually stop by. That's pretty cool.,11/17/2011 19:04
1711,1451, Neat. I'll have to check that out next time I'm in NYC. Free too!,5/21/2011 1:57
1711,1711, It is awesome that Jazz is played all over. In Pakistan they have a jazz artist who's on the charts.,6/27/1985 12:32
1711,1711," Cool! I think I'm going to go listen to some jazz now, I have some really old lps. Anyway have a great night.",10/28/1992 3:15
1711,1711, You too. ,7/20/1977 18:27
1711,1451, bye,4/24/1998 8:37
1711,1451, Do you enjoy going to the library?,3/19/2006 4:21
1712,1588," Hello - I used to go to the library all the time when I was little, but I haven't been to one in a very long time. What about you? \",1/4/2015 22:29
1712,1712," I agree. I used to go, but no longer. I feel it is a shame since a library is an invaluable resource for the community, offering vast amounts of resources",2/15/2007 11:50
1712,1712, Yep. Did you know Jupiter saves Earth from many asteroids? ,5/26/1984 9:29
1712,1588, I did. It is among the many facts you can find in the library. Did you know a falsely imprisoned man spent 10 studying law and became a lawyer after proving his innocence?,6/5/1974 9:44
1712,1588," Oh wow that's pretty amazing. I saw that the direction of Earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,000 years.",12/13/1992 10:49
1712,1712, What kind of affect does the reversal of magnetic field have on life on earth?,11/26/2013 16:14
1712,1712, I have no idea on that. I'm thinking maybe natural disasters and things of that nature. ,7/15/2021 8:41
1712,1588," Did you know that if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans only make up for 1 min and 17 sec?",9/23/1986 22:58
1712,1712, That's pretty eye opening of how short humans have lived on the Earth.,7/17/1974 15:35
1712,1588, It is a shame though that in such a short time we have destroyed 80% of earth's nature forests. I hope we can change that for the better going forward the next few minutes,10/13/1995 14:52
1713,1356, The Earth is almost 4 times as dense as the sun. ,1/30/2015 16:23
1713,1713, That is pretty cool. Do you think earth will continue to be the only life inhabited planet?,9/6/2011 15:51
1713,1713, I'm not sure on that. I'm a religious person and think God only put people on this planet. I have no idea if there is other life out there. ,5/9/2011 7:48
1713,1713, The UN even appointed official ambassadors for extraterrestrials just in case,9/16/1989 6:20
1713,1356, That's crazy. Do you think there is other life out there/,10/29/2001 1:31
1713,1356," Considering the vastness of space, it seems more likely for more life to exist than not",12/27/2019 11:15
1713,1713," Yea that's a good point. It's hard to say if there is other lifeforms out there. Switching gears a bit, did you know there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?",11/25/1983 15:12
1713,1356, I did not. I only use like 2?,6/24/1985 16:45
1713,1713, Haha yea same here. I really only use 1 way. ,3/11/2010 4:55
1713,1356," I wonder if shoes will evolve to be lace less? In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat.",11/18/1970 11:55
1714,1714," Hello, do you know much about the earth?",3/29/1980 7:13
1714,1714," Not much, except that i live there...",1/30/1983 0:44
1714,1229, Good enough. When earth was created apparently the day was only 5.5 hours,8/9/1982 20:55
1714,1714, That would be crazy! How would one nap?,8/13/1988 1:03
1714,1714, I know no time for nap. And 71% of the earth is covered in water,10/17/1974 7:24
1714,1714, Wow! That seems like a lot. I wonder how much is salt water like in water world.,12/4/2005 12:06
1714,1714," The majority of it. Sadly, 80% of the forests have been destroyed",1/12/2010 4:45
1714,1229, That does make me sad. Teddy Roosevelt was a known conservationist. He made the National park and forest service.,4/28/2007 15:38
1714,1229," Wow, goof for him.  Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?",10/5/1988 2:17
1714,1229, Is that a bad thing? Can we make it in a lab?  Can old shoes perform better than new shoes?,11/15/1970 14:00
1715,762, Yeah apparently shoes that date back to 5000 years ago are much stronger,5/21/2009 16:53
1715,1715, Maybe those cobblers can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week!,5/15/1999 13:35
1715,1715, Yeah that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how the keep them smelling fresh?,12/24/2002 12:01
1715,762, Febreeze?,8/5/2016 18:54
1715,1715, Hahaha yes great option. But also tea bags,8/24/1982 13:56
1715,762, can you imagine wheelbarrowing 32000 books at 85 years old?,5/23/1993 12:59
1715,762, No but I heard Gladstone did that. What an amazing man,5/5/2011 6:14
1715,762, I would just give up... There are more libraries than mcdonalds so that is a good start.,1/16/2007 20:28
1715,762, I like that fact a lot. Have you heard of the Library of Things?,9/1/1983 1:32
1715,1715," No, I have not. What is it?",2/8/2007 10:43
1716,1716, A library in Sacramento where you can borrow other stuff besides books. Nice chat :),12/9/1978 0:24
1716,1636, Are you a dog fan like Google?,8/8/1972 14:20
1716,1636," Personally, I like most animals, regardless of whether they are cats or dogs. I admit however that the history of man and dogs are a long and interesting one.",3/22/1981 13:58
1716,1636, Who would've thought that man's best friend would truly be man's best friend and be able to get blood transfusions?,5/20/1978 18:34
1716,1716," Honestly, I don't know why the concept that animals can give eachother blood transfusions never occured to me. However, dogs have adapted very well to living with humans.",7/7/1998 22:36
1716,1636, The stray dogs are spared in Istanbul due to generous recyclers who put0 their recyclables in a machine that dispenses food and water to them.,9/2/2001 22:03
1716,1716," That is very fascinating. Considering how many people love their pets, I think that would definitely motivate some people to recylce more. I didn't get to ask, do you like most animals like dogs or snakes?",11/16/2012 1:15
1716,1716," I sort of like dogs, but snakes no way!  I respect that they are such stealthy animals that can swallow prey bigger than their heads though!",11/19/1973 12:23
1716,1636," Personally, I am okay with reptiles like snakes, but I do feel that you can't get as close a bond with them than other mammals. This may be due to the inherent fear of snakes wired into the brains of mammals. For instance, you have seen those videos of cats being scared of cucumbers?",5/31/1989 3:48
1716,1716, My dog is afraid of vacuums.  So maybe they look like snakes with all those hoses.,7/19/2006 17:09
1717,1717," They probably don't understand what vaccums are. If I didn't know what vaccums were and this weird thing made weird noises and sucked air, I would be scared of it too.",8/15/1998 4:18
1717,1717, I wonder if animals in New Zealand fear snakes because they have none there.,11/18/2016 22:58
1717,1166, It must be a paradise for people who hate snakes. I mean in some places there are flying snakes.,4/24/2011 10:48
1717,1717, I guess that makes legless lizards not seem so scary.,11/15/1982 14:27
1717,1717," I mean I'm fine with reptiles if they can't bite my arm off or they don't have poison. Although I fear crocodiles like poisonous snakes, I never knew crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes.",9/13/1992 23:07
1717,1166," I like observing animals and all the neat things about them, but there's nothing like relaxing to some smooth jazz!  I would have loved to see the free jazz concerts in Harlem hosted by a woman at her apartment the past 20 years.  Some famous people even have been there.",12/11/2013 10:51
1717,1166," Jazz is very intriquing as it maintained its core essence all the while abosorbing and drawing from different national, regional, and local cultures to adapt unique styles. Even in Korea, jazz bars are quite popular.",2/13/1994 20:08
1717,1717," I wonder why growing goatees adds comfort to jazz trumpeters.  I played the trumpet, but I don't see the connection.",4/22/1982 20:28
1717,1166," Perhaps it is a cultural phenomenon, a symbol of their art?",9/5/2019 10:51
1717,1166, Maybe Clint Eastwood understands as he has enjoyed jazz all his life.  I didn't know he played the piano,1/7/2013 20:49
1718,1156," Jazz is now a major form of musical expression with many famous players such as Clint Eastwood. As you said, perhaps he would understand. After all, it seems like he is a man of many talents and understanding.",2/9/2004 20:51
1718,1156, I wonder what a jazz orchestra sounds like?  They have one in Pakistan.  Would they have violins in jazz?  Nice talking to you!,6/16/1995 7:21
1718,1156, I love animals. I especially love dogs. How do you feel about dogs?,12/27/2017 5:04
1718,1156," I'm a huge dog lover. I grew with them all my life. Funny though, since I've been on my own I've had a cat. I really want a dog too though.",5/9/1979 5:15
1718,1156, I currently also have cats. Did you know that there are 12 different blood types for dogs?,5/22/1975 14:17
1718,1718, Nope! Interesting though. Us humans only four. Do you have a favorite type of dog?,9/17/1999 19:49
1718,1718, I tend to the like the smaller ones but not too small. French Bulldog sized dogs. They also have blood drives for dogs which is very nice. ,6/29/2013 12:41
1718,1156, I love Golden Retrievers. Always had once growing up. So smart. My parents recently had a Novia Scotia Duck Trolling Retriever. Smartest dog I've ever known. He had a huge vocabulary.,11/24/2002 10:03
1718,1156, They are both very smart dogs. Did you also know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that have the instinct to understand pointing?,3/20/1997 10:38
1718,1718," Yeah, they can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps too!",6/11/2013 21:06
1719,1342, Oh wow! Very impressive. Have you heard about the dog vending machines in Instanbul?,12/27/2015 0:49
1719,1342, No I did not. Is it for dog treats for the human owners or can the dogs actually use them?,10/10/1994 1:31
1719,1719, I'm not sure who does the deposit but it will release food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. That's such a good idea.,11/16/2004 6:20
1719,1342, I bet the dogs are smart enough to figure out that if they bring plastic back they get food. That's awesome! In Moscow some dogs have actually figured out how to use the subway.,1/27/1997 20:13
1719,1719, I'm sure they are. Wow! I did not know about the subway in Moscow. We should give animals a lot more credit. ,11/24/2020 11:56
1719,1719, Yeah I mean we haven't even really mentioned all the dogs that have actual jobs lol. It's incredible.,11/10/1998 13:36
1719,1719, It definitely is. Did you know that dogs being color blind is a myth?,2/21/2020 4:29
1719,1719, I think I've heard that before. They just see color in lower definition or something right?,8/26/2022 17:57
1719,1342, They just don't see as many colors as we do. ,9/16/2000 20:53
1719,1719, Did you know that dogs attached themselves to earlier humans by hanging around and getting rewarded with food?,11/8/1980 4:25
1720,1339, I did not but that makes complete sense. I know that they say that the direct ancestor of current domesticated dogs is likely extinct. ,11/18/1990 4:58
1720,1720, Right it was a different kind of wolf that dogs evolved from them. I think smaller and probably less aggressive towards humans.,12/11/2000 4:46
1720,1339, Yes the modern wolves are not closely related to that wolf. Nice chatting with you. ,5/26/2016 17:52
1720,1339, Hello!  Do you like dogs?,12/2/2017 10:18
1720,1339, I love dogs.  They are the easiest way to clean the floor. Truly a messy eaters best friend.,12/27/2000 19:10
1720,1720," lol  That's funny!  Dogs are not colour blind, but can't see as many different colors as human.",3/20/1971 3:16
1720,1339, I think Canis lups familiaris is better than canis familiaris.  Cause some dogs are a little loopy.,7/26/1995 3:51
1720,1720, lol  Due to them being so smart their influence on humans is what gave them the nickname man's best friend.,5/11/1995 10:56
1720,1339, Mans biggest moocher as well.  I know that if I point at something the dog will go look at it.  Do you have an elephant?  Can you point at things for it to look at?,9/17/2011 11:03
1720,1339," LOL Funny!  But, true!  There are 12 different blood types of dogs.  I never knew that.",2/11/2005 19:17
1721,278," No, I had no idea.  I have also never heard of a dog blood drive.  My dog can  not drive.  Too many squirrels..",5/20/2007 11:27
1721,278, hahaha My dog doesn't like snakes.  He should be a New Zealand dog since there are no snakes there!,6/15/2017 1:48
1721,1721, The fear of snakes must be hard wired into it's brain as well as humans and monkey brains.  Interesting how some things you just know and some you learn  on the job.,6/11/2004 23:57
1721,1721, Yes!  lol  There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.  Sure wouldn't want to cross on of those!,3/17/1974 20:27
1721,1721," It would be easy to be afraid of them.  I happen to know that snakes paired organs occur one after the other, not side by side.  Got to be thin, join weight watchers.",6/24/1977 1:17
1721,1721, haha  There are legless lizards that resemble snakes.  I wonder what they look like?  That would be odd to see a snake like body with a lizard head.,3/6/1981 5:04
1721,1721," It seems that lizards have evolved from having legs to not about 25 times.  So, there must be an advantage to it.",9/6/2019 4:16
1721,278, yes! lol  Do you like jazz music by any chance?,11/22/1986 12:46
1721,278," Like a snake, I have no ears for music.",2/9/1970 22:35
1721,1721, lololol,12/11/1998 18:06
1722,1677," Jazz is easy to like, for it is free verse in a way.  All about expression. ",10/28/1981 4:57
1722,1722," Yes!  Clint Eastwood is a lifetime jazz fan, plays piano, and scored several films with the music!",5/3/1986 7:49
1722,1722, It would be pretty wild to go to someones house in Harlem and listen to a free jazz concert.  With Dirty Harry working the door.,4/21/1993 11:05
1722,1722, LOL yes!  It was a pleasure chatting with you!  Have a good evening!,6/13/1989 16:01
1722,1677, Are you an avid reader of comic books?,9/24/2019 16:26
1722,1722, A little. I have read a few of the Marvel comics.,3/8/2013 2:51
1722,1722, I know that people call them graphic novels now. The story lines have become more serious. I don't know how I would go about picking the best books of the year.,12/22/1977 1:53
1722,1677, Comics go back as far as the 1830s and started in Japan,10/20/2015 20:10
1722,1722, Really? I didn't know that. I imagine that pictorial story telling went back to the Egyptians.,9/5/1993 12:40
1722,1722, Comics actually started  out as strips in newspapers in this country,12/17/2012 9:29
1723,1290, The name is a bit misleading because many of the stories are quite serious. I heard that Stan Lee ends his converstaions with the word Excelsior! I wonder what that's about.,3/29/2020 0:06
1723,1723, Stan Lee will forever be remembered. His passing was a great loss to the comic world,4/13/1984 14:36
1723,1723, I heard that he got $1 million per year just to stay alive! That's a great incentive. I heard that Marvel trademarked the names super-hero and super villain.,10/3/2017 11:04
1723,1290," I am just glad that Michael Jackson didn't get his hands on Marvel, he would have likely ruined it",5/16/2012 8:05
1723,1290," Disney has made a lot of movies, which is good, but I wonder how the fans feel about Marvel now. Do you read DC comics ever?",6/25/2013 15:25
1723,1290, Only for the Superman comic,2/5/2015 10:36
1723,1723," DC stands for detective comics, so DC Comics stands for detective comics comics. I think Marvel is more popular in general.",9/8/1998 10:36
1723,1290, I always found it interesting that Google got its domain from Garfield,10/25/1977 14:49
1723,1290, I didn't know that! Garfield?! I think it is one of the boring-est comics out there. Lasagna + Mondays = humor? Not to me!,10/13/2011 2:45
1723,1723, I was a huge Garfield fan when I was a kid,9/11/2017 20:40
1724,361, Comics are a good way for kids to learn to read. I liked reading Peanuts. ,10/24/2017 15:40
1724,361," I wish I had a copy of the first comic, Famous Funnies. That is worth a lot of money I bet",1/18/1995 5:45
1724,361," I bet! I wonder what was in it. Famous Funnies, but I have no idea what characters where in there. No so famous now, I guess.",9/18/2022 13:12
1724,361, I wonder what the early Japanese comics were like?,1/19/1986 15:43
1724,361," Probably different from today's. Maybe based on samurai and ninja, not cutesy characters.",3/8/2014 5:41
1724,1724, I don't think I would find them too funny either,8/2/2007 8:39
1724,1724, LOL! I agree. Maybe people didn't see the medium as inherently funny. Might have watched live entertainment for laughs.,2/9/1992 2:07
1724,1724, I enjoyed our conversation about comics. Thanks,11/23/2021 3:34
1724,1724," Hi, how are you?",9/14/1993 0:58
1724,361," Hey, I'm doing pretty well. How are you?",3/30/1986 9:26
1725,946," I am doing well! Are you a fan of hip hop? I am a pretty big fan myself, its been around since the 70s",10/27/1973 16:51
1725,1725," I do. I'll add a caveat that I'm a white guy and 90's grunge is my favorite type of music, but I'm into everything. I don't know much about the history though, especially the stuff in the 70's but I loved rap from the 90's and early 2000's.",4/4/2017 12:11
1725,1725, I have heard that Mcdonalds used to pay artists for referencing the big mac in their music!,6/7/2006 12:11
1725,1725," Doesn't surprise. You still artists doing stuff like that today. I wonder who referenced McDonalds? Not Eminem, Jay-Z, or Nas. I could see Lil' Wayne.",6/6/1985 1:14
1725,1725," I could too haha. Muhammed Ali is regarded as a hip hip pioneer because of the poems he wrote, he probably did not talk about mcdonalds though haha",2/27/1982 2:20
1725,1725," Definitely not. Did you know after the US, France is second largest hip hop market in the world? I remember Tony Parker, the NBA player put out a rap album in French.",11/18/1991 8:45
1725,1725," that is very interesting, I wonder why it caught on so well in france but nowhere else?",11/12/1989 14:32
1725,1725," I don't think NBA player's do well with music, but I think the reason is that he's actually French himself. Hip Hop is usually about your culture so it would make sense.",6/11/2000 21:01
1725,1725," that is true I suppose, Hip hop really exploded here in america though, very different culture than most places",8/25/2006 10:01
1725,946," Yes, especially in New York City, my favorite place. Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens were huge for hip-hop. Followed by California.",4/4/2008 18:24
1726,1726," That is for sure, do you appreciate rapping or DJing more?",9/11/1976 22:25
1726,1726, Rapping for sure. DJing isn't really as much as skill as it used to be. You?,1/3/2005 6:57
1726,121," I agree with you, I almost feel like we are being close to not having any more rap beats left to make without getting very complex, I was thinking about that the other day",5/14/1973 16:09
1726,1726, It's so true. I just heard that new Cardi B song that samples I like it like that. Like that's what they are down to using lol. You read any good books recently?,8/24/1994 16:51
1726,1726," I like to read some of CS Lewis' work, he was a great guy, pretty much invented the you laugh you lose challenge",3/29/2010 20:53
1726,121, It's funny in the 18th century people were worried about the spread of the reading of novels,7/14/1985 12:27
1726,121," that is true, makes you wonder what our choices will look like years from now!",10/11/2005 1:30
1726,1726," I don't know. I hope they read though, I think the complex cognitive process is a useful exercise for the brain.",11/18/1990 22:03
1726,1726," Oh for sure, I think just basic communication is important, and comprehension of language is too, unfortunately it is not taught enough in our schools in my opinon, or not taught correctly",12/16/2016 21:56
1726,1726," I agree. It requires practice at a young age. Even if it's just reading novels for fun, it's good for everyone.",10/26/1999 14:12
1727,378," I am surprised Ender's game was suggested reading for the Marines, I need to read that, I watched the movie, it was okay",6/12/1984 2:57
1727,378, Hi there! Hanging out today. Just got back from getting groceries. Love listening to music when I drive. Love hip-hop. It's hard to believe it has been around since the late 70's!,2/20/1982 10:16
1727,1727," Awesome, I love hip-hop too. Hip-hop music has a large vocabulary of any popular genre of music.",11/8/2015 20:49
1727,378," Yes, it does. In 2005 Mcdonalds paid hip hop artists when they mentioned Big Macs in their songs.",8/1/2021 15:53
1727,378, That is very smart of McDonald's and good publicity. Muhamed Ali was actually regarded as one of the earliest pioneers in hip-hop.,12/26/1972 8:30
1727,378, I didn't know that. Was that before he was a boxer?,6/20/1980 14:39
1727,1727, I would guess it was during although I'm not sure. The band Vanilla Ice who sang ice ice baby was the first hip-hop single to top the Billboard charts.,3/4/1995 15:03
1727,378, I used to love that one.France is the second largest hip hop market in the world.,9/2/1985 3:00
1727,1727, Oh really that is surprising! It is commonly argued as to whether hip-hop started in the south or west Bronx. I think just saying it originated in the Bronx is good enough.,4/6/2022 2:40
1727,378, I am sure. So I also like to read in addition to listen to music. Did you know that in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?,5/21/1994 2:04
1728,1728, Wow I would like to learn more about that. Reading is very powerful though it promotes deep exploration of tax during interpretation.,12/20/1992 13:15
1728,1728," I can see that. The world record for speed reading is held by Anee Jones with a rate of 4,700 words per minute.",11/16/1983 0:58
1728,578, Wow that is amazing I don't even think I could do 1000 words per minute. I like to enjoy reading. Interestingly enough silent reading as a recent phenomenon.,3/7/1992 22:44
1728,578, I don't either. OMG I can not imagine listening to people read out loud all the time. I would be crazy!!,9/22/1989 6:25
1728,1728, Yeah that would be so annoying LOL. I love that even blind people can read to using braille.,3/13/2008 0:21
1728,578, I do too. I was amazed as a kid when I heard about braille. Did you know that Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list of three of the five US military branches?,3/15/1983 2:54
1728,578, Oh no I didn't know that that is very cool. I should read that book. The creator of Game of Thrones begin writing by selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children. Look at him now.,8/25/2017 23:28
1728,578," Oh, that's funny. I wonder how old he was when he did that?",9/18/1993 9:32
1728,578, Yeah good question I don't know. President Andrew Johnson never actually attended school his wife helped him learn math and reading. What a good partner.,2/21/2004 9:44
1728,1728, Hard to believe that was a non-issue. Good thing reading success is measured as comprehension. His must have been high.,2/23/2015 0:54
1729,1729, Yeah I agree with you I bet it was. Do you ever read comic books? Marvel once spent 10 years convincing the US government that X men are not human LOL.,6/14/2021 3:51
1729,1729, I did when I was a kid. I know Michigan State University's library  has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world. Nice chatting with you! Bye!,3/27/2004 9:31
1729,1496," Hi, do you love or hate comic books.",6/19/1975 18:50
1729,1729, I like them. I'm getting a bit tired of the comic book movies though.,12/26/1981 11:39
1729,1729, I can still handle the movies because they are just fun events but the tv series have become annoying.,7/10/2004 21:12
1729,1496," Yeah, the TV series is definitely overkill. What did they make a TV series into? ",1/31/2017 2:54
1729,1729, If you check Netflix you will find many different series both Marvel and DC comic stories. The first season of The Punisher' was great but I could not finish the second season. Way too much like a soap opera.,8/10/1990 11:20
1729,1496, Interesting. Well I do like some of the movies. Apparently the Michigan State University library has the biggest publicly available comic bookd collection inthe world. ,1/27/2017 20:22
1729,1496, I do like good movie with a super hero and a super villain I can root against. That is the beauty of the Marvel comic book movies.,8/6/1984 4:53
1729,1496, Did you happen to catch the movie Glass? It just came out. ,3/8/1991 10:56
1730,388," No yet, I love the director so I am going to make sure I see that movie. The last super hero movie that have have seen was Aqua man. ",4/23/2006 13:27
1730,1730," Interesting, I never saw that. Glass is ok, but I liked Unbreakable more. ",11/21/1991 13:38
1730,388, I have seen Unbreakable. It surprises me that Glass was only just Ok since it was directed by M Knight Shamala.,11/2/1990 6:27
1730,1730," Yeah. BTW, did you know that Tom Hardy recorded his own hip hop mixtape? ",12/31/1990 7:42
1730,388, That sounds interesting. I wonder why it took so long to release his mixtape.,8/28/1989 16:52
1730,1730," I'm not sure, have you seen any movies with him in it? ",9/21/1980 1:50
1730,1730, I have not seen venom yet but it looks like a fun movie.,5/22/1990 6:44
1730,388," Yeah, it does. I saw the batman movie where he played Bane. ",3/29/1993 20:02
1730,1730, He is a good actor and plays well in the comic book genre. It is too bad Stan Lee died but he lived a good long life.,5/13/2021 1:09
1730,1730, Yeah it is he passed away. Did you happen to see Starship troopers? ,5/20/1997 4:37
1731,753," Yes, I was suprised that it became a cult classic. I found it a badly acted B movie when it first came out but I guess the military types like it because it is very pro military. ",7/28/1984 21:10
1731,753," I thought it was campy, but I never read the book. Did you read it? ",1/28/1971 23:09
1731,753, Campy is the right word. It is not really my type of book. I like to read science fiction novels but more fantasy type stories.,1/23/1985 4:31
1731,753," It's not a terrible movie. Anyways, nice chatting with you. ",2/28/2011 15:01
1731,753, howdy there how are you doing today? has it been a good day for you? do you feel like a superhero?,10/4/2002 5:09
1731,753," Yes, I do! lol How about you today? Are you a Batman fan?",4/24/1970 22:57
1731,1731, I do like batman. he was an orphan. he had a tough life.,2/24/1975 11:21
1731,1731, That is true.He grew up and became a true hero! Who was your favorite Batman?,1/21/1997 6:54
1731,1731," um, which ones were there? michael keaton, val kilmer, george clooney...",1/17/2006 20:20
1731,1731," Yes, I was thinking of those three also. Michael Keaton is my favorite! Michelle Pfeiffer is my favorite catwoman!!",5/13/1994 2:51
1732,1732, she was great. that suit must have been tough to put on though. ouch. she was really sexy though.,1/17/2008 3:41
1732,1732, Her face was perfect for a cat! Did you know Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises made over 1 billion worldwide.,9/1/2016 6:40
1732,231, did not know that. i guess that the world has a hunger for superhero films. the dark knight. was that chris nolan?,7/25/2011 4:49
1732,231," That's right he was, he was good also. Have you seen pictures of the tower in Australia called Gotham Tower? ",7/25/1995 1:34
1732,1732, no i have not. it sounds cool. does it look like something from batman? what city is it in?,8/24/1993 17:29
1732,231, I'm sure of the city and yeah a resemblance of the tower in batman.,8/5/1992 0:57
1732,1732, that sounds really cool. i should visit oz someday. what other kinds of entertainment do you like?,9/12/1991 16:05
1732,231," NFL games, legally they are considered entertainment as the WWE is.",8/25/2010 12:05
1732,1732, that is interesting. that is not what i thought at all. i thought it was a sport since the outcome is not known before hand.,9/4/1988 13:05
1732,231," Yes, I did too. Another name for female superhero is super heroine! who knew?",1/18/1985 11:25
1733,1911, do you have a favorite superheroine? wonderwoman? supergirl?,1/30/1986 6:31
1733,1733, Cat Woman! and you who is yours? If they had made Batman with Bill Murray ad Eddie Murphy I would expect to laugh. I just look at Bill Murray and he makes me laugh!,9/19/1971 3:57
1733,1733," the man is a comic legend. he was going to become a doctor but blew it and ended up in comedy. anyway, great chat!",5/19/1995 0:04
1733,1911, I agree! There are 30 superhero movies coming between 2016-2020! Have a great day!,12/2/1993 16:31
1733,1733, you too. stay super!,3/10/1970 10:38
1733,1733," ha,ha,ha Good chat!",5/20/1975 10:02
1733,1733," hey there, do you like batman?",12/21/2004 0:47
1733,1733," Hello, how are you? I do like Batman, all superheroes for that matter. What about you?",1/22/1990 23:30
1733,1733," yes me too, I enjoy the movies a lot. do you know who created it?",6/24/1991 12:28
1733,1911, I believe it was created in the 40s by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.,6/30/1994 11:45
1734,1734, Cool. Universal studios was going to build a gotham city themed park,5/2/1998 7:10
1734,1734, That would have been cool.  There have been so many variations of batman over the years. Do you have a favorite?,2/28/2001 21:27
1734,1734," I am not sure if I have a favorite, I like them in general. How about you?",3/23/1983 21:09
1734,1734," I would agree, I Like them all but I would say I am partial to the Dark knight trilogy.",9/19/2002 10:30
1734,1734, nice. did you know smallville was planned to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman?,2/13/2018 5:29
1734,83," No. I did not know that, that is interesting. I wonder why they went with superman. Did you know that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US?",7/5/1986 9:40
1734,1734, that is a lot. How much do you think is the cost of collateral damage from superheroes?,12/23/1970 0:15
1734,83, Oh man easily in the millions.,8/4/2019 6:17
1734,83, yeah. there were plans for a comic series to fix that damage,4/18/1975 6:10
1734,83, No one cares how it gets fixed I guess. Did you know that there is actually a superhero called Normalman. He was the only one on a planet without powers.,8/27/2006 5:01
1735,734, I wonder why he was invented in the first place,9/30/1999 6:05
1735,734," I don't know, but what help would he be able to offer. No wonder it was not popular. Besides  superheroes what else do you do for entertainment?",8/22/2017 3:34
1735,1735," I play video games, do you like them?",7/20/2016 8:25
1735,1735," Yes I have been playing since I was a kid, on the original Nintendo.",5/9/2010 0:27
1735,734, Did you know nintendo could only display 54 colors?,1/18/2013 4:48
1735,1735," Interesting, they finally stopped making the NES in 2003.",1/7/1985 16:06
1735,1735," Yeah, a lot of people were unhappy. It was nice chatting with you",9/25/1999 21:59
1735,734, Hello,8/4/2000 11:03
1735,1735, Hi ,9/14/1974 2:41
1735,734, Do you like cats.,2/9/1978 1:17
1736,1967, No i am dog person .. cats will sleep a lot i like to engage more with my pet,2/22/2008 7:03
1736,1967, That is true I heard when a cat reaches 15 years old it has spent 10 years of its life sleeping.,3/2/1996 18:53
1736,1967, yes i remember a fun fact that cats have a cafe in japan,7/4/2014 18:22
1736,1967, Amazing. There is a town in alaska that has a cat as its mayor since 1997.,1/18/2006 20:42
1736,1736," Mayor , well that's something to be checked. may be because of it natural hunting ability lol",1/6/2021 18:08
1736,1967, Lol. That town probably has like 11 citizens or something like that. Wonder how the cat tells them what decision he has made.,12/23/1986 16:39
1736,1736," may e he has ability to write , i have heard a cat was co-author of a book. Didnt quite understand whats with obsession of cats ",5/21/2004 19:01
1736,1967, Me either other than keeping mice away they are pretty much just a nuisance.,2/28/1970 15:29
1736,1736, may be some day they can put an album and outsell hybrid theory as best selling album of the century,3/14/1998 19:55
1736,1967," They probably wont have the support of the airways or a major tour, but hey NWA did it why cant they.",8/16/2018 1:37
1737,1737, may be they can create a new format much advanced than CD and MP3,9/6/2022 0:26
1737,1358," Hey I heard about a set of identical twins released an album on their 100 year birthday. What a way to celebrate, huh.",6/16/1974 14:16
1737,1737, thats a interesting way to celebrate. It is easy to use a piano keyboard with 2 people composing ,1/19/2015 22:53
1737,1358, I should say so. Lol.,7/27/2005 8:13
1737,1737, do you know that Pianos are from 1700 .. almost 300 yrs old,11/14/1975 5:07
1737,1358, Thats crazy. If you have ever looked inside one they are pretty intricate machines or instruments I guess I should say.,2/13/1971 12:57
1737,1358, yes  strings and hammers and levers .. not what we wish to see,1/8/2004 4:35
1737,1737, Lol. Well I gotta run. Good chat mate.,5/30/1995 1:32
1737,1358," Hello, do you like cats?",7/7/1988 13:24
1737,1737," Yeah, i guess so. i feel about cats the way they seem to feel about me. YOu?",2/27/2011 3:28
1738,1387," I like dogs better, but I like cats too. There are cat cafes in Japan where you can pay to play with cats and have drinks.",3/12/1994 11:32
1738,1738," Yeah, Japan is a great place for animal lovers. they also have owl cafes. ",8/18/1997 11:37
1738,1738, For sure. Cats at 15 years old have spent 10 years of their lives sleeping.,5/31/1992 4:34
1738,1738," Yeah, they know how to live LOL i wish i could get that much sleep. i envy them",8/26/2020 17:06
1738,1738, I envy them as well lol. The cat in the Godfather opening scene was a stray they found.,8/10/2002 17:13
1738,1738," Yeah, that was a well behaved cat. really added a lot to the character of the godfather. ",2/1/2014 7:02
1738,1387, I agree. A town in Alaska has a cat mayor named Stubbs.,4/23/1974 2:55
1738,1387," I bet Stubbs does a better job than most folks. doesnt make hasty decisions, sleeps on important ones.",7/3/2019 20:59
1738,1738, Do you like listening to music albums?,6/14/2019 10:48
1738,1387, I do like listening to albums. i was listening to a jazz album on youtube recently.,11/17/1978 15:33
1739,1739, I love rock music. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album was the best-selling album of the 21st century?,11/11/1990 10:25
1739,1739, I did not know that. i know that the band did over 300 concerts in one year. they were popular.,5/30/2010 10:26
1739,1739, Wow that's a lot of concerts. Reel Big Fish lost their rights to their original record label so they re-recorded all of their albums.,8/24/1982 3:22
1739,1739," That must have been a headache, but i guess they wanted to hold onto their music. good for them!",5/19/1977 18:56
1739,758, Yep. The Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums.,5/25/1996 1:12
1739,1739," Yeah, when did that album come out? it has been a best seller for decades. ",9/26/2014 5:42
1739,1739," Not sure when it came out, but it's been around for a long time. I love Pink Floyd.",11/11/1979 11:26
1739,1739," Floyd is awesome. they have done unusual things, like record an album in an empty stadium. Anyway, great chat!",5/20/2022 7:28
1739,1739, I love Pink Floyd. It was good chatting with you too!,11/21/1997 22:41
1739,758, do you like cars?,7/14/1979 18:52
1740,877, I sure do. Do you like cats?,1/6/1970 16:43
1740,877, Yes I do. THere are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan now,10/19/2021 1:52
1740,877, Nice. Many people end in the er because they trip over the cats though,8/5/2017 5:40
1740,877, Wow crazy. Did you know that cats sleep a lot?,10/7/1991 22:08
1740,877, I ave heard that and they have not an extinction in over 10 000 years,5/17/2015 9:21
1740,877," WOw, they sleep 10 years out of 15 if they live to that age",10/15/1992 7:34
1740,877, Wow amazing. Do you have a cat?,8/15/2021 15:10
1740,877, I have a dog only but would like to get a cat,10/10/2016 9:58
1740,877, Well keep in mind that white cats with blue eyes are usually deaf,11/16/1982 17:49
1740,1740, Oh wow. Did you know there is a cat mayor in Alaska?,9/18/2013 3:16
1741,682," Really, that is amazing, the cat leads them?",11/5/2017 7:40
1741,682, Yup since 1997. Do you like music?,9/15/1988 23:53
1741,682, I do. Legend the album has been on the albums charts for 914 weeks,4/16/1971 16:07
1741,682, Wow . Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of this century,12/23/1989 9:08
1741,682, Wow amazing. Aerosmith make less money with albums than with guitar hero,6/30/2020 15:12
1741,682, Wow. Twins in Japan released an album when they were 100,7/10/2020 3:56
1741,682, Nice. Walmart only sells clean version of albums,5/8/1970 3:01
1741,1741, Nice. The best album of 2014 was the dark side of the moon?,2/19/1994 12:48
1741,1741," Wait, was that album released a long time ago?",1/30/1995 4:52
1741,1741," Yes 40 years before that , amazing. Nice chat here",10/13/1989 18:50
1742,1742, Robert Oppenheimer sure changed  history and is a curious character of history,6/20/1991 13:01
1742,1742, He sure was a character. It would be interesting to read American Prometheus.,1/23/1977 18:54
1742,572," I agree, it received a Pulitzer so it must be a really informative book for sure, ",6/19/1994 8:22
1742,1742, Many have the question of what goes on inside a man who contributed so much to the killing of so much people! and his cool attitude towards it.,9/14/1981 20:37
1742,1742," It would be an interesting read for sure, he did led the development of nuclear weapons, the same ones that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki",1/26/1976 2:11
1742,1742," there is another book about him, called Trinity, but I thing that one has a lot of fiction and mixed reviews",6/30/2020 15:37
1742,572," That would be an interesting read as well, its amazing how you can go from hero to villain in a simple lapse of time, I guess Oppenheimer was both at the same time",9/13/1988 20:20
1742,1742, today reading is considered very healthy but did you know that in the 18th century was not like that. There was literal panic because the spread of reading novels!,11/4/1984 21:54
1742,572," I didnt, although info is a weapon I guess giving people books could have an effect on society specially back then. ",5/14/1993 12:48
1742,1742, I guess was something new. That is probably why it was considered a danger.,11/27/1971 9:15
1743,1743," Yeah I agree, you know theres a person that can read 4,700 words per minute! thats crazy fast!",2/6/1981 1:11
1743,1743," Such a talent, her name is Anne Jones and set a world record!",2/19/1972 20:23
1743,1337," I wonder how they measure that though, do they just take Anne's word of is there a piece of tech that can actually measure that",12/28/1970 16:24
1743,1743, I do not know why. but do you know another character that has studies a lot is Kim jong-un. He has a degree in physics,6/30/1973 12:23
1743,1743," He does? I wonder if its even real, if it was issued by North or South Korea I would have my doubts, I think physics is a really interesting branch of study",2/7/2016 22:02
1743,1337," Who knows, but did you know what they did to achieve a beautiful curly heir in the main character of the movie brave?",7/31/2002 20:13
1743,1743," Yeah I heard they spend 3 years studying physics in order to achieve that, they had to get it right and apparently that wasnt an easy feat.",9/22/2016 2:11
1743,1743," That is cool, they really achieved a beautiful hair. So much to do about studying, reading and writing. for example I did not know that Julius Caesar wrote Hercules is his youth",9/28/1984 9:23
1743,1743," Thats interesting, I guess there are many facts to be discovered yet, are you a fan of fiction novels?",1/30/1991 7:29
1743,1337, I love reading fiction and non-fiction. I love that reading encourages imagination. It helps with analysis and creativity,4/18/1980 8:45
1744,1744, Yeah reading can be pretty good and enhance the mind.,10/5/1978 2:11
1744,566, Hello. Do you like to read?,12/31/1976 13:40
1744,1744," Yes, I enjoy reading, Do you like to read too?",12/13/1977 12:59
1744,566," Yes I do.  I read slow though, no where near the world record for speed reading of 4700 words per minute.",3/30/2002 20:00
1744,566," lol, I can not read that fast either. I can't understand how they understand what they are reading that fast.",8/4/2012 13:31
1744,566, I can't either.  Reading success is reading comprehension not glazing over words.,5/1/2022 22:09
1744,1744, Very true. Well who knew Kim jong-un has a degree in physics!,5/25/1992 6:31
1744,566," I certainly didn't.  Physics is so broad and yet so important as a topic.  I mean, Pixar studied the physics of curly hair just to get one of their character's hair right in the movie brave.",1/28/2004 14:46
1744,1744," I know, that surprises me. That's alot of time on curly hair.",3/6/2015 17:02
1744,566," It really is, especially just for an animated movie.  Then on the flip side you can think about the creation of the universe and say it could have come from nothing and not violated physics.",8/9/2008 20:31
1745,1745, That's a good way to put it. It is so vast and unbelievable.,9/26/2012 21:41
1745,1745," True.  With physics being so broad it is hard to see how you can study it.  Yet, it's one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps even the oldest.",7/16/1991 6:39
1745,459," Yes, I agree, the oldest. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers and abilities.",3/4/1994 4:00
1745,459, No I didn't.  Did you know that cyborgs aren't really all that modern?  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest/first known example of one.,3/24/1980 12:59
1745,459, I saw that and was surprised.. Military branches have a list of sci-fi novels to read and Starship Troopers is one of the first.,3/11/1995 17:58
1745,1745, I've never read that but I think I saw the movie Starship Troopers.  Since fiction is any story of the imagination I guess that the author had a pretty good imagination!,10/3/2018 11:37
1745,459, I would say so. Was it a good movie then?,5/27/2019 3:20
1745,1745, It seems like it was if I remember right.  I am a fan of science fiction.  I heard about a judge trying to ban a comic back in the 50s because it had a black character. I'm very glad that we have progressed away from times like that.,6/1/1994 5:36
1745,1745,"  Oh, I agree with you. I like some science fiction In the 18th century they had a moral panic from reading novels. How sad is that!",6/27/2011 2:38
1745,1745, Definitely sad!  I wonder if they knew that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of hercules and oedipus when he was young!,3/8/2000 15:01
1746,1838," Really, Now that's interesting Its been a nice chat!",3/17/2018 7:32
1746,1746, On the other hand George RR Martin hates fan fiction.,10/21/1987 23:41
1746,1838, Do you play any instruments?,1/5/2019 7:30
1746,1838, In fact I do! The violin. Funny story. My dad loved the 3 Stooges and had seen one of the stooges play violin and wanted me to play because of that!,4/13/2004 8:17
1746,1838, How long have you played the violin? Is the 3 stooges a play?,6/8/2001 3:28
1746,1838, I've played for at least 10 years.  Three stooges - old time comedic trio.  Black and white movies.  Slapstick humor.  You could probably find them on the internet and find a bunch of clips.   You spend a lot of time on the internet?,6/6/1976 8:13
1746,1838, You are very talented! Comedic trio when it's musical? That is interesting. I would love to watch those kind of movies. I,1/20/2004 23:43
1746,1838," Well, the movies weren't musicals really.  Just one of them, Larry Fine was musically inclined.  ",8/17/2010 12:04
1746,1746, Are they silenced films? ,8/30/2021 7:53
1746,1838, No.  They started in Vaudeville but I think the peak of their popularity was in the late 30s early 40s.  You know who else was a violinist?  Albert Einstein.  I was pretty surprised to learn that. ,7/1/1974 20:16
1747,541, No wonder Albert Einstein was a prodigy and a genius!!!,11/14/2003 23:31
1747,541," Right?  So many skills in one man, you'd think he might have been a robot!  But then again, another human would have had to have been smarter than THAT to program him.  Ha!",6/16/1980 22:07
1747,1747," His mind is imaginative and seems so unrealistic. You already know he is a mad genius. Speaking of robots, they can be controlled by rat brains. That is insane.",4/11/2017 11:26
1747,541, OMG!   That is pretty insane.  So the rat make it go search for cheese? Ha!  Here's another insane robot fact.  Did you know Michael Jackson had planned to build a 50 foot tall moon walking robot?,4/25/2013 8:53
1747,541," However, it is the robot looking for cheese. I think I would be down to have a rat robot as a pet for a day. Well, where is this 50 foot tall moon walking robot then?",4/2/2021 22:27
1747,541, Don't think he ever got to it but it was supposed to be roaming around the desert sands of las vegas.  I'd find that freaky.  Did you ever watch that show Mythbusters?  They used to make a lot of robot things on that show to test things.,2/28/2015 20:22
1747,1747, For a second I thought you meant ghost busters. Why did they stop the show?,10/6/2012 23:49
1747,541," Ha!  I liked Ghostbusters too.  Not sure why they stopped Mythbusters.  Did you know one of the guys on the show, Grant Imahara, created Craig Ferguson's (former talk show host on CBS) robot sidekick?",8/19/1970 16:52
1747,541," The theme song is funny and catchy. That is weird. If I had a robot by my side, I would cry. I feel like one day robots will destroy and rule the set.",6/3/1981 0:30
1747,1747, I'm sure people have theories on whether or not robots could take over the world!  Could probably look some of those theories up on the internet.  Amazing what you'll find on the World Wide Web.,4/28/1975 22:15
1748,854, Conspiracies on YouTube are everywhere. I hope that does not exist though. ,11/26/2019 10:37
1748,854," Yeah, some of the stuff you find on internet is useless stuff.  But some of it's important, like that stuff you're supposed to read when buying products or services online.  In all honesty though, I don't think a lot of people read that.",9/10/1983 22:15
1748,854, It was nice chatting with you. Have a good day!,9/5/2002 2:37
1748,854, Same to you. Don't let the robots get you! ,7/25/1989 19:46
1748,854, That is funny.,6/7/1987 10:43
1748,854, hi how are you? do you like the internet?,12/17/1990 0:25
1748,1748," Yeah, I use it almost every day.",1/3/1981 21:51
1748,854, I feel it has become too much of our lives. i wonder if it is harming our health in any way.,11/24/1991 22:24
1748,1748, Yeah I wonder about that too.  Data privacy is a big issue.  With so many different individuals and corporations on the internet it's difficult to know what is being done with our data.  Only a small percentage actually read a product's or service's full terms before buying it on the internet.,1/8/1983 15:49
1748,854, i heard it was 7 percent but im surprised that its that high. i thought it would be about 1 percent frankly. most people dont think about their data.,5/8/2010 1:28
1749,1953, The internet can be addicting too.  The constant novelty is dangerous.  I find it hard sometimes to stop using the internet on my phone.,8/6/2008 12:09
1749,1953, I think that we want constant stimulation. this is not natural. we cannot be constantly stimulated like rats in an experiment.,3/16/2005 23:17
1749,1953, Did you know robots can be controlled by rat brains?,12/11/2008 3:25
1749,1749," im not surprised. rats are quite clever, and i guess if scientists understand the rat brain, then they can wire up the interface. cool.",7/28/2001 18:12
1749,1749," I'm all for technology being used to enhance our lives, such as robots being able to debone a chicken.  But it's more like the internet is controlling us now.",2/17/1999 12:34
1749,1749," yes, the internet is deboning our minds. it is pulling us apart. plus it is ubiquitous. ",8/21/2011 10:17
1749,1749," Yeah, the internet is even available on mt, everest!",10/18/1992 11:43
1749,1953, i guess for everyone that needs to take a selfie on the peak and upload it to the cloud.,1/1/1995 6:51
1749,1749, That sounds like something I would like to do.  It'd be better than sitting on the computer and surfing the web.,4/27/2008 6:02
1749,1953," yes, i wish i had the courage to climb a mountain but it sounds too risky. maybe if a robot carried me up to the peak of everest, i would go.",7/11/2011 12:41
1750,653, But I hope robots don't influence us to be more lazy.  ,4/23/1976 9:32
1750,653," that is a concern. as robots do more jobs, what will people do? just sit and stare? will they exercise? i hope so.",5/20/1988 10:50
1750,653," Yeah, it seems like a bad combination, if for instance, robots take over almost every physical task for us, and we end up sitting at the computers becoming addicted to and slaves to the internet.",12/26/1997 10:11
1750,1750," yes, we would entertain ourselves to death. the creativity and initiative that made the robots would disappear from humanity. a tragedy.",7/17/1993 7:00
1750,1750," With the death of our creativity, then maybe artificial intelligence would become the new intelligence.  All we would need to do is be mindless consumers and provide input so artificial intelligence can grow.",11/26/1988 7:19
1750,653," the AI would break away and leave this planet. we would be left behind. typing conversations into computers and desperately try to make contact with other human beings. anyway, great chat!",4/5/2009 17:07
1750,1750," Yeah, I appreciate your time.  Have a good day.",1/20/2020 21:57
1750,1750," Hi, how are you?",9/27/2021 3:31
1750,1750, I'm doing well.  How are you today?,4/7/2005 13:47
1750,1750, I'm great!,1/2/1990 19:29
1751,1751," I'm having a problem with my kid's smelly gym shoes, I've read that putting dry tea bags in the shoes will absorb the odors.  Have you ever tried that?",10/16/2009 11:02
1751,1989, I have and it does work.,6/13/1978 5:06
1751,1989," Cool, I'm going to try it then.  You know you read about some of these remedies and wonder if they really work or not.  Especially if you read it on the internet. Of course I hear that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes, if you can believe that.lol",9/17/1975 23:09
1751,1751," Yeah, I know what you mean. Wow, that is crazy! I've heard that ballet dancers go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week! ",9/29/2006 6:21
1751,1989, That is quite a bit of dancing in a week to go through 4 pairs of shoes.  Wow!,6/16/2022 16:02
1751,1751, I know right!,11/23/2005 1:11
1751,1989," Have you ever heard of the store in Alabama, that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. found in unclaimed baggage at airports?",8/28/1993 0:44
1751,1989," Wow, and that is legal?",10/5/2020 20:14
1751,1989," Yes, apparently so.  I wonder if anybody bought my pair of size 6 Calvin Klein jeans that was in my luggage and got lost back in 1985. lol Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed for $15.00 and he was not paid to endorse them.  Can you believe that?",4/24/2001 14:14
1751,1751, Those shoes must have been great. I seen on the news that a Steve Smith a nfl wide receiver leaves his cleats on the field so he can raise awareness to homeless people that don't have shoes.,8/5/1987 20:20
1752,265," I saw that, it promotes a good cause.  Kudos to him.  Do you know there are some people that will look for collar gaps on your clothes just to tell if you have your clothes tailored or not?  Isn't that insane with homeless people that have no shoes to wear.",3/29/1973 17:57
1752,1752," That is strange. Oh! I don't know if you have learned about this in history, but apparently Pilgrims wore colorful clothes and only wore black on special occasions. ",4/19/2002 16:59
1752,265," Yeah, I had heard about that.  But show me one picture with a Pilgrim wearing something colorful, they must have had nothing but special occasions every day.  ",10/24/2004 0:21
1752,265, Haha I know!,4/20/1999 6:15
1752,1752," Speaking of clothing, did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986?",3/20/1972 4:30
1752,1752," No, I had no idea, but of course I wasn't alive then. lol",2/13/2009 4:37
1752,265," Oh, poor baby, you're telling your age!  It must have did poorly or it would still be around.",1/10/2016 6:57
1752,265," Yeah, I wonder what it looked like. Speaking of Apple, if you smoke around their computers it voids the warranty because it's considered a biohazard!",9/6/1974 19:44
1752,1752," I can totally see that.  Smoking wrecks everything it comes in contact with.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you today, but I need to go walk my dog.  Have a good day.",4/14/2000 15:45
1752,1752," Hi, how are you?",10/31/1997 13:22
1753,874, I am doing okay. I hope you are well. Are you someone who owns a lot of shoes?,9/6/2012 15:48
1753,1753," I have some, but only have a rotation of like 4 pair. Im not a materialist person...",9/29/2002 18:53
1753,874, I'm not overall but I do love shoes. Were you aware that there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?,5/27/2003 23:18
1753,1753," No, I was not. I did know Stephon marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15. he was not paid to endorse them.",4/28/1993 4:42
1753,874, I wish all shoes were that cheap. Apparently Bill Nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes.,4/4/2022 9:22
1753,874, Really! That's weird. Speaking of shoes... Nfl wide receiver steve smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness to homeless people without shoes,10/26/1982 0:00
1753,874, That's a nice sentiment on his part. There are wizard of oz inspired shoes that actually guide you home when you click your heels together using a gps system. That's pretty amazing and fun. ,7/19/1981 11:08
1753,874, That would be good for kids. We could always find them at least.,8/9/2018 21:29
1753,1753, That is true. Queen elizabeth ii employs somebody to wear her shoes before her to ensure they are comfortable. That's some real power she has. ,3/17/1973 2:54
1753,1753, I am a weirdo so I would never let anyone wear my shoes before me. Get me a robot to do that!,2/7/2004 1:53
1754,1754, Ha ha. You always need a good outfit to go with your shoes.A man wore 70 items of clothing in a chinese airport to avoid the bagging charge. That's innovation.  ,8/27/1989 12:08
1754,1754, Reminds me of when Joey put all of Chandler's clothes on during Friends. I am not proud of myself for that knowledge...,8/6/1990 8:14
1754,1754, Ha ha. I saw a lot of Friends but do not remember that scene. The greeks literally made asbestos clothing and it was almost as valuable as gold! I would imagine they became very ill. ,3/12/2007 19:28
1754,1754, 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.,11/11/1997 16:00
1754,1754, I'm not surprised. Current products are just not made to last. ,8/14/1991 18:43
1754,33, yeah. Putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags will absorb the unpleasant odor,5/26/1988 11:06
1754,33," That makes sense. I'll have to try that. An african tribe still wears victorian clothes, the style of former German occupiers that they've made their own.",2/9/1988 22:44
1754,1754, Rip curl makes clothes in north korea yet the label says made in china. ,2/15/1970 10:01
1754,1754, WOW! That just seems lazy and as if there is no oversight. ,8/30/1991 2:56
1754,33, Nice chatting with you.,4/19/1980 18:23
1755,1755," hi, do you have a favorite kind of shoe?",1/16/1977 9:40
1755,1528," No, not particularly. I like wingtips. What about you?",9/5/2007 9:24
1755,1528," I like running shoes, so comfortable",2/25/1973 20:04
1755,1755, Stephon Marbury promoted  shoes that retailed at $15. but was not paid to endorse them. I wonder what kind of shoes they were.,11/28/1980 12:01
1755,1755, Yeah that is strange that someone would promote shoes and not get paid for it,7/8/2008 11:27
1755,1755, Maybe he was hoping that the shoes would go to people that needed them. Maybe he has another source of income that's adequate. I don't know. ,7/30/2015 12:47
1755,1528, that would explain it for sure. do you watch ballet?,1/15/2005 14:28
1755,1755, Not really a fan. It looks painful.,2/9/1977 7:57
1755,1528, yeah it does and they go through 4 pairs of shoes a week,9/17/2013 3:02
1755,1528," I'm not surprised. It looks like they are hard on the shoes. I wonder how they would do with the 5,000 year old shoes, which are supposed to be better than modern ones.",1/6/1983 10:56
1756,1756," yeah, I would like to have a pair of those.",10/4/1993 10:34
1756,1756," If they had an unpleasant odor, you could just put teabags in there. Probably not 5,000 year old teabags though.",11/14/2003 12:54
1756,1726," hahaa yeah not those, but it is amazing how they work so well",12/13/2001 18:21
1756,1726, I'm impressed that Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people,6/6/2008 20:00
1756,1756," I think that is a good approach to it. how about clothes, do you have a favorite type?",9/19/1979 11:25
1756,1756, Don't really have a favorite. I wonder about Apple's line of clothing. Who wore that? Computer geeks?,1/3/2012 20:40
1756,1756, hahahah that is a good point. wonder what it was called?,5/15/1998 10:13
1756,1756, I have no idea. But my guess is that it was not manufactured in North Korea. ,1/20/1986 8:28
1756,1756, yup like rip curl who is north korean but made in china?,2/5/1988 15:34
1756,1756, I don't think any company should be doing business with North Korea. ,7/14/2011 14:35
1757,1757, yeah me neither nice chat,4/21/2018 4:40
1757,1757," Hi, are you interested in or do you use computers?",12/22/1985 23:36
1757,706," Yea, it's fascinating how computers are able to process arithemetic and logical operations automatically",9/24/1995 23:21
1757,1757," Yes, modern computers have the ability to follow a generalized set of operations call programs. These programs allow computers do perform an extremely wide range of tasks.",4/28/2006 15:16
1757,1757, It's crazy how computers are used in everything from microwave ovens to smartphones,6/29/2001 11:49
1757,706," I know, right? Computers are used to control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices like what you just said. In addition, they're in remote controls and  industrial robots.",6/1/1998 3:54
1757,1757," I never knew captcha stood for completely automated public turning test to tell computers and humans apart, the name is annoying as the test",8/16/1976 22:29
1757,706," Yes, or maybe it should be called gotcha for catching the bots that are always crawling online.  Did you know that the space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on only 1 MB of RAM. That seems strange to say the least. ",5/6/1991 13:13
1757,706," That does seem strange, did you know Ada Lovelace was the first person to write a computer algorithm?",12/12/1987 2:47
1757,706," Yes, she actually has a programming language named after her called Ada.  That's way back in the beginning though.  Humans are capable of genius level of work and creativity.  Did you know that someone else built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks?",11/16/2001 22:03
1758,1758, That's insane but it's probably much better than the manual cardboard computers Bell distributed to students in 1968,9/16/1981 2:16
1758,1758," No doubt. Also, did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water? No that would be cool to see how that worked.",1/14/1981 3:07
1758,1758, That would be a sight. At Stanford the first google computer was housed in a lego enclosures,7/19/1974 23:35
1758,1758," Cool, that's funny.  Did you realize that some transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers and even memory sticks?",7/9/2001 7:23
1758,1875," Yea, that's pretty crazy. I never knew in 1995 Doom was installed more than Windows 95",6/2/2015 11:39
1758,1875," I remember DOOM and Wolfenstein. That takes me back.  Actually did you know that if you smoke near an Apple Computer, it voids the warranty by making it 'a biohazard'? Smokers beware!",1/5/1984 11:26
1758,1875, Lol I heard smoke being hard to get rid on clothes but not computers. Funny fact is people use to do laundry on old faithful,1/10/1982 19:04
1758,1875," That is funny. Actually, speaking about Apple, did you know that they have had a clothing line since 1986?  Good to know.",3/2/1977 10:42
1758,1875," No, I had no clue. Did you know Miguel Cabarello designs Bulletproof clothing?",5/2/1979 8:27
1758,1758," Wow, did he have a good idea or what?  Wonders never cease.  Did you know that a certain store in Alabama only sells clothes, cameras, etc found in unclaimed baggage at airports.  Who would have thought of that one?",8/1/1986 16:58
1759,1759, Much better idea than making clothes with Asbestos like the Ancient Greeks did,5/15/1989 5:45
1759,1759," Gee, I guess they didn't want to live that long. Its' been nice chatting with you. Have a good evening.",11/5/1974 6:01
1759,540, Hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,7/3/1995 9:49
1759,1759, I heard it but I'm skeptical.  That sounds far too high and what's the definition of natural.,8/31/1971 4:35
1759,1759, Not sure in this case.  When the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long!  ,2/6/1995 20:25
1759,1759," That was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava.  Bummer, they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century. ",2/25/2018 17:18
1759,1759," Yeah that would be crazy. If earths history was represented as a 24 hour period,  humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol Its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe. ",11/14/1994 22:00
1759,1759," Yeah, the sheer distances give me that feeling. The UN actually has an official ambassador to ETs.  ",2/8/2007 3:38
1759,1759," I read that,  that just covinces me more that we are not alone.",2/1/2005 23:03
1759,540, I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic down.  I probably blamed my ISP.,12/25/1975 9:56
1760,1760, That is crazy!  I bet people were so confused lol I dont remember it as well.,4/6/1981 12:54
1760,1085," Wow, a single Google search requires more computing power than what it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon!",8/6/2009 15:39
1760,1760, That is surprising!  Wow everytime I google search I could be sending someone to the moon instead lol,12/14/2007 12:11
1760,1760, Ha.  I guess Google once used goats instead of people to mow the lawns.  I can't imagine what a hassle it would have been to manage all the goats.  They are mischievous creatures that eat EVERYTHING. ,4/12/2005 14:22
1760,1760," lol true,  thats the new thing in Caifornia now,  hiring goats to eat your lawn,  I see it everywhere,  I think its great as long as they are managed by someone lol",6/20/1972 20:09
1760,1085, Recent readings have confirmed what I always suspected:  woman are more likely to own an iPhone.  I'm a dude and I've owned one.  Android now...,10/22/2009 8:03
1760,1760, I had the iphone 4 a long time ago and now I have the android lol ,3/1/2019 23:42
1760,1760," It seems that with Apple, there are too many strings attached forcing you to use their stuff.  ",5/27/1995 23:14
1760,1760," I know right,  all there stuff has to go together like you are hooked into buying everything they own.  Its really annoying ",10/12/2002 12:42
1760,1085, I guess that's why we went Android?  Funny Jobs switched iPhones during presentation because they would run out of power and RAM.,10/22/1973 4:37
1761,1761, Lol right!  I love android its so simple.  Thats a fail lol it cant even last a presentation without running out of ram lol,1/9/2014 18:47
1761,279, I think the irreplaceable battery on iPhone hurt their market.  Funny Microsoft had funeral for the death of the iPhone when it launched their own line.,12/12/1980 19:12
1761,279, lol Nice!  ,12/5/1986 12:26
1761,279, I had a MS phone and it was really good but lack of available  SW kind of ruined it. ,10/19/1981 0:06
1761,1761, Sorry to hear.  its been great talking to you. ,7/10/2010 12:23
1761,279, Did you see Crazy Rich Asians?,11/25/2021 4:08
1761,279, No I haven't.  I heard it was good.,10/10/2015 10:28
1761,1761, I have not yet either but I am aware of it's cultural impact. It was made from a novel. Apparently it is a very good romantic comedy. ,6/22/1991 6:53
1761,279," My mother like it.  I think it stars Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding and Constance Wu, right?",6/18/2002 23:16
1761,1761, It does. Apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy. His mother rejects her due to her less affluent background. ,9/27/1993 17:47
1762,1762," If I remember correctly, Jon M Chu is the director.",12/2/1971 22:27
1762,1762, Yes he is. It was also the first movie to feature an all-Asian cast in Hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and I'm glad that it did well. Asians seem very underrepresented in film. ,7/27/2015 19:24
1762,541," The movie is 121 minutes long, which is just right and is PG-13.",11/14/1999 17:12
1762,1762, That makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more Asian-Americans can see themselves represented on screen. ,8/15/1992 18:04
1762,541," Well, lets switch topics.  Are you a science person., Earth is the 3rd planet from the Sun.  It is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life. ",7/2/1999 17:52
1762,541," I am a little. I enjoy learning about it. I was aware of those facts. I also know that if we viewed the entire earth's history as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day. That is a mind blowing stat. ",3/31/1993 13:09
1762,1762, This is mind blowing.  Thank God for Jupiter.  It saves Earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us.,11/9/1974 0:59
1762,541, That is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas. We do not even know if there is any solid land there. I wonder how it takes the impact first in this case? ,7/17/2017 7:05
1762,541, It's very interesting.  So is the fact that the Sun is 4x less dense than Earth.,1/8/1977 20:00
1762,541, I know it is much larger but i don't think it has any solidity to it so that's interesting. Another science fact is that when Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. ,1/6/1972 7:10
1763,1763, I didn't know that.  I wonder why. There is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet.  It is the Hudson Bay region of Canada.,7/1/2001 20:40
1763,588, I wonder how much affect that has? Is it enough to change weights in any way? I wonder. I do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century. ,5/30/1991 16:16
1763,1763," Really, I hope that is ok for us?  I'm also a big tech guy, how about you?  Did you know new Google employees are called nooglers.",9/10/2001 20:22
1763,588, I did not. What a silly name ha ha. ,4/30/1974 12:29
1763,588," Yes, and they have to wear a propeller hat on their first day.",2/7/2010 14:11
1763,1763, That is even more silly. ,9/14/2012 5:59
1763,1763, I have always loved reading. I think that reading has always been a gateway to knowledge for me.,7/9/1981 22:08
1763,1763, Yes and knowledge is power. I mostly listen to audio books now though. What about you?,10/1/2020 5:36
1763,588, I love audiobooks. Did you know that in the first 3 months of 2016 audiobook sales rose 35%?!,9/1/1999 16:20
1763,1763, I can believe it! I'm suprised with the rise of technology that there are more libraries than there are McDonald in the US. ,1/26/1984 18:21
1764,1659, I think that libraries provide technology access to people who aren't fortunate enough to have it at home.,7/9/1975 13:28
1764,1659," I agree, im in one right now. lol! ",10/30/1979 8:23
1764,1764," I think the concept of a library of things is amazing. Allowing people to check out other things, such as sewing machines, or seeds, is wonderful. Allows short term usage rather than a long term commitment. ",3/5/1993 12:02
1764,1764, Yeah that's a neat concept. You know there was a man falsely accused and spent 10 years working on his proving innocence. ,11/8/2007 18:34
1764,1659, I think Law Libraries in Prisons are wonderful,3/4/1975 2:12
1764,1764," I do too, something for them to elevate there minds. If you publish a book in Norway the government will but 1000 copies.",1/22/1978 19:12
1764,1659, That is very interesting. I wish I had learned braile. I think that would be a very interesting tactile way to read. ,11/13/1992 9:33
1764,1659, Apparently Michael Jackson released an audio book. Did you know that?,12/19/1986 21:05
1764,1659, I had no idea!,4/28/2022 11:25
1764,1764," Yeah and steven spielberg directed it for ET, however that works",9/14/1986 22:04
1765,555, Had you heard that Jim Dale performed 300 voices for the Harry Potter books?,12/29/1984 9:51
1765,555, Yeah he had to be reminded of them ever time they were on set. that's a lot of voice overs.,6/6/2002 3:55
1765,1765, Audiobooks were initially started as a project to help those that are blind. I love to listen to them while I drive though! They are so useful!,12/7/1991 5:23
1765,555, Man i listen to them when i'm doing just about anything. I hear in that same year were sale rose that e-book sales declined. ,7/5/1970 23:27
1765,555, I can believe that. I would much rather have an audiobook over e book. ,5/2/2019 19:50
1765,555, Me too! Wow there were quite a few stars who narrated the dungeons and dragons character Diizzt do'urden.,4/17/1988 13:42
1765,1765, I saw that! I am not sure who that is though. ,4/25/2019 22:40
1765,555, My favorite book is Starship troopers. Have you read that book? ,8/17/1987 23:47
1765,1765," Hmm, sounds familiar but I haven't. Is it sci-fi? I love to read and have done some writing myself, including sci-fi.",3/13/1982 16:52
1765,555," Yes, sci-fi. I didnt know that its on the list of reading materials for some of the us military. ",1/24/1998 14:04
1766,1926, I'll have to look it up then if that is suggested for them. Seems like the Art of War would be more appropriate. Speaking of Sci-fi. Did you know Michael Jackson released an audiobook/soundtrack album for E.T.?,10/16/1985 20:44
1766,1926," No, i didnt! I love that movie! ",8/21/2012 4:52
1766,1766," Yes, one of my favorites of all time. I wonder if people check out the DVD from the library. I heard that many libraries now carry video games to attract teenagers inside. Book checkouts have increased due to the seeing books on the shelf on the way to the games section.",11/5/1990 0:28
1766,1766, Some library's do! I know that the one next to my house does! ,1/6/2021 18:38
1766,1926," Really??? I wish mine did. Which games? I bet not GTA 5. Speaking of teenagers, a Malawian teenager taught himself how to build a watermill out of junk to power his village.",9/30/2012 18:09
1766,1926, Most are pretty family friendly. But theyre free so thats not bad. ,8/16/1974 20:22
1766,1766, I bet minecraft. I used to teach in a computer lab in middle school. I encouraged the kids to play minecraft instead of boring test taking skills. I told the students to switch the screens real quick when the principal would come in.,3/14/2022 23:23
1766,1926, Almost all kids are into that game! I like that libraries are still around. Theres one in California that even checks out sewing machines and stuff. ,8/17/1978 2:57
1766,1926," I read articles years ago that they were starting to consider shutting libraries down but now with computer access they are becoming more popular than ever. I use the free wifi to download movies on my phone from Prime. I have completely cut the cable at home, no tv, no dish, no cable, no wifi. I just stream from my phone offline now. In the library of Alexandria they would take original copies of books and copy them putting the originals in the Library for safe keeping.",5/10/1988 12:09
1766,1926, I have cut all of my stuff as well. I feel like i should read more to get close to the record of 4700 words per minute. ,9/6/1971 22:11
1767,1767, I tried speed reading. It can be done but it takes the fun out of it. And it is not relaxing. It is like driving a race car through a park and finishing it in 30 seconds as opposed to walking for 30 minutes enjoying nature.,5/19/1971 18:22
1767,1767, I wish i could speed read! I think its crazy that people in the 18th century had a panic over the spread of novels. ,12/16/2008 3:43
1767,828," Well, they had a panic over the spread of comic books originally too. They thought they were making kids violent and wanted to ban them like wanted to Elvis's singing and today's video games. Do you read Audio Books? I heard Dotrice narrated 224 different characters for the Game of Thrones audiobook.",7/13/1988 17:35
1767,828, i know it seems like a panic over nothing. I didnt know that. Ive actually never seen games of thrones. ,6/6/2020 1:50
1767,1767, I had to stop watching it because my wife doesn't like violent shows and would get mad.. Now all I watch with her is chick flick shows like Covert Affairs and Mozart in the Jungle. What shows  you like?,9/21/1979 4:54
1767,1767, I watch too much Parking Wars. Im addicted to seeing people get upset getting parking tickets. ,10/7/1977 21:20
1767,1767, I saw one about a Towing Company. But I think that was a different one. There was a funny one about them trying to get a guys car who was doing Karate on one of the male drivers when the black female tow driver came up behind him with a wrench and knocked him out. She said He may know ka-rah-tay...but I know cra-cra. I laughed my head off.,3/14/1995 14:24
1767,828, Those shows are mind numbingly good. You have a great day! ,5/2/2013 21:52
1767,828, You too!,2/16/1997 11:14
1767,1767, thanks,4/22/1975 12:54
1768,1768," Hey do you like to read? One of my favorite books is The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and the author of that book, CS Lewis, used to have you laugh you lose competitions with ready bad poetry.",8/15/2012 9:22
1768,1768," I do like to read, CS lewis is a great author although I like audio books better. ",7/15/1972 0:51
1768,1768, I'm sorry I meant reading and typed ready. Audio books are great too. They originally started out a a project for the blind.,9/5/1979 21:30
1768,1487, Did you know when it got started? Jim Dale is a great audiobook narrator ,3/16/1989 20:56
1768,1768, I'm not sure. And yeah he's done 300 voices for the Harry Potter audiobooks.,11/18/1988 14:21
1768,1768," He had playback recording to remember each of the voices, he is really skilled. ",12/12/1981 16:27
1768,1487," Very smart. In 2016, audiobook sales rose 35%. People found it's a great way to multitask.",8/14/2010 17:20
1768,1487," I do too, I like to listen to audiobook on the way to work and also when I am working. ",7/16/1979 2:58
1768,1487," Me too, but mainly when I go for long walks or while exercising.Michael Jackson even released an audiobook directed by Spielberg for ET.",2/22/2020 11:47
1768,1487, Yeah even Michael Jackson released an audiobook and Weird Al Yancovich did so as well with Wil Wheaton and other artists. ,3/28/2007 11:46
1769,1769, I was surprised to learn that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US. I would have though the opposite.,10/26/2006 7:07
1769,1153," I know right, there is a McDonalds pretty much everywhere, did you hear about the man that studied law while falsely imprisoned. ",12/12/1993 18:55
1769,1153," Yeah, he studied law over 10 years and proved his innocence. Later he became a lawyer to help free those who have been falsely accused. Very admirable.",9/24/1976 23:13
1769,1153," It is, many would just cry the sentence out but he did something with his time there kind of like forced college. ",4/25/2002 8:40
1769,1769," If there's a will, there's a way and with some determination and perseverance anything can be accomplished.",1/23/1975 8:00
1769,1153," Yeah I guess so, reading is a good way to accomplish it you can learn so much, too bad many kids prefer watching movies and wasting time now a days. ",4/10/1981 12:44
1769,1153," Yeah they just aren't being taught the value of reading. In the 18th Century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels, now there is smart phone panic.",9/29/2014 20:13
1769,1769," Yeah there seems to be one, I hope that changes one day, on a positive note smartphones are useful for audiobooks so not everything is bad. ",7/27/1995 14:21
1769,1769," Yes and books can be read on smartphones. Did you know that there is a library of things? Patrons can check out items that they need now, but not for long term.",4/1/1997 16:08
1769,1769," I didnt know that, that is and interesting concept, a library of things, nice. I bet its really popular. ",7/27/1984 15:33
1770,1770, I would go if I were in Sacramento! Great chat! Have a good day.,12/10/2012 15:24
1770,1770," Yeah that would be a great idea, its been great chatting with you also, I'm going to read a book now maybe go to the local library bye. ",7/11/1998 23:34
1770,1770, Hi there! Do you use Google search?,6/18/1972 19:16
1770,786, All the time... Do you remember it going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  I probably thought is was on my end...,10/26/1981 13:15
1770,1770, Really? I don't remember that! I probably thought the same thing! It's hard to believe Google has been around since 1998. I think that we've come such a long way since then!,11/9/2016 7:29
1770,1770, They are huge.  They have grown and changed with the times although I don't like their political stuff.  Did you know a single Google search takes more computing power than it took to send Armstrong and 11 others to the moon?  Powerful slide rules back then...,8/28/2011 15:41
1770,1770," Oh wow, no I wasn't aware of that either! I do know that instead of hiring people to mow google's lawn, the company once used hundreds of live goats!",6/18/2012 15:07
1770,1770, Hate to get that vet bill.  Goats will eat anything including cans.  Do you use an iPhone?,8/4/1988 15:41
1770,786, I don't use an iPhone. I've never been able to afford one. Do you?,12/20/2010 19:57
1770,786, They are overpriced.  I had one several years ago.  I'm Android now. I guess women are more likely to own them.,2/2/2018 17:44
1771,1771," Oh that's interesting! I wonder if it's because of money, or maybe because women tend to be more trendy than men. Or what!?",12/13/2005 4:09
1771,89," I think it's the cool factor among peers.  Funny, MS had a funeral for iPhones when they launched their line of phones.",5/30/2009 13:36
1771,1771," It's interesting that during the first iPhone presentation, Steve Jobs had to keep switching phones behind his desk, otherwise the phone would run out of ram and crash.",9/21/2019 4:30
1771,1771, I never liked that the iPhone didn't have a user-replaceable battery. That and there are so many strings attached with Apple -- they make you buy their stuff.,2/26/1989 19:16
1771,1771, Oh yeah. That's why I prefer the most functional yet the cheapest phone I could find. Were you aware that more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?,5/28/2020 8:21
1771,1771, I heard that but it sounds really high.  I'm very skeptical of such claims as science has become very political.  I am concerned about another such claim: helium will run out this century.,11/26/1999 6:00
1771,89," Yeah a lot of things like that can change. It shouldn't be a problem for humans or other life. For example, when earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. We can handle some rates of change, hopefully.",5/29/1998 19:11
1771,1771," What about the balloon industry?  Oh the horror.  Since my political awareness, the sky has been falling down for one reason or another.  Sick of lies from the media.  It's funny that the UN has an official ambassador for ETs.",1/23/1999 19:53
1771,1771," I agree! I'd rather not be represented by someone I don't even know, to aliens! That pretty crazy! I just found out that Google maps calculates traffic by tracing how fast android devices are moving on the road!",7/15/1982 21:54
1771,89, That's clever but a little disconcerting.  I guess our poles are mostly covered in ice.  I was thinking snow...,9/18/1987 2:38
1772,733," Oh yes, and Earth's surface is about 71% covered with water, mostly by oceans! I can't help but love science, myself.",6/25/2007 3:04
1772,733, I love it too.  I'm an engineer and watch a lot of science documentaries.  I have recently learned that Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.  I actually thought that honor belonged to Mercury. ,2/11/1993 15:26
1772,733," Oh I love science documentaries! I find it difficult to watch anything that isn't a documentary! Hey, it's been great talking with you! I hope you have a great day!",3/9/2017 8:19
1772,733," Yes, and get those floaty balloons while you can! You were an excellent chat partner!",12/20/1985 19:52
1772,733, Are you a fan of reading?,12/7/2018 10:46
1772,733, Yes i am.  I like to read a lot of different types but in particular science fiction.  You?,9/16/2019 2:23
1772,733," I like them too, I like reading books then watching the movie. Like starship troopers, ever read that?",8/9/1986 7:17
1772,1772, I haven't read it but i've heard that its on the reading lists of most of the military.  Have you read it?,6/13/1989 23:50
1772,733," I have, the book is better but the movie did a good job portraying the brutality",6/10/2011 15:25
1772,733, Cool. A book that i really want to read is Ender's game. Iv',11/27/2012 0:12
1773,1944," I haven't read that one, I think that is on the military's reading list also. Movie too maybe?",10/11/1974 19:18
1773,1773," Sorry, my sentence got cut off.  Yes, it's a great movie. I've seen it several times.  I'm interested in reading the book to see what the military is so interested in.",8/3/2019 19:47
1773,1773, for sure! Did you ever hear that CS Lewis and Tolkein used to hold a you laugh you lose poetry competition?,10/25/1977 16:03
1773,1773, No I didn't.  I didn't even realize they knew each other.,8/9/2017 7:27
1773,1944," I didn't either, I would have loved to sit in and watch that. Do you listen to audiobooks at all?",7/30/1971 3:21
1773,1944, Me too.  I have listened to a small few.  Now that we are talking about it I just might increase my number. The whole reason I haven't read ender's game is due to time constraints. An audiobook just might be the answer to that.,7/23/1975 23:52
1773,1773, I like to listen to them sometimes on my commute to work. Weird al has narrated a book ,3/15/1982 16:26
1773,1944, He has?  What kind of book was it?,10/8/2010 12:22
1773,1773, It was dungeons and dragons lol. Other famous people had some parts in it also,5/7/2005 15:47
1773,1944," I've played dungeons and dragons before.  I just don't see a Weird Al connection lol!  Then again, maybe he changed his voice. ",2/2/1995 0:10
1774,374," right lol, I am sure he did something funky, its weird al!",7/10/2014 14:56
1774,1774, True.  Jim Dale did 300 different voices for the harry potter books so I guess it's possible.,1/28/1972 1:36
1774,374," wow, I can't even fake 5 different voices to make my daughter laugh lol. I will have to check it out! It was so nice chatting with you!",12/19/1973 2:12
1774,1774," Say, do you take your daughter to the library?  There are so many different things from books to dvds that can be found in one.",12/2/1983 23:58
1774,1774," She isn't of age quite yet, but I definitely will! Enjoy your day!",8/3/1980 3:05
1774,374, Have you ever been to a library? ,7/14/1974 11:00
1774,1774, I have been. Have you?,2/7/1979 3:38
1774,1774," Yeah, I lost my library card a few weeks ago. Did you know the government of Norway will buy 1000 copys of a book that you publish if you live there? ",4/23/2006 10:25
1774,374," Wow! That might be worth the investment. Just set the price at $1,000 and youve made your money.",8/24/1973 8:22
1774,374," Yeah, that's crazy. There are more libraries than Mcdonalds in the US. ",5/8/1979 21:18
1775,1413, Wow! I just listened to a Radiolab podcast about a library on the border of the US and Canada that serves as a place for people to meet their families at. Those with a one time visa and their parents without a visa to enter the US.,4/23/2020 21:35
1775,1413," Nice, did you steve king was scared of bambi when younger? Hilarious.",4/9/1977 11:02
1775,1413, Was that his gateway movie into the horrow genre?,11/19/2007 15:56
1775,1775," Good question, I'm not quite sure, it sounds like Bambi! LOL",6/12/1999 15:05
1775,1775, A man spent 10 years of his life in jail studying to become a lawyer. He proved his innocence so I guess it worked.,10/4/2008 2:49
1775,1775," Wow, so I guess he was better than the prosecutors, that's awesome!",2/9/2022 15:08
1775,1413, Yeah. He went on to help others prove their innocence. Seems like a good cause.,3/29/1976 4:48
1775,1413," yeah, he should have been a lawyer from the get go. I wonder how much he charges? ",7/6/1990 21:00
1775,1413, A lot if he is a speed reader and can read at 4700 words per minute. Although that would not help his billable hours...,4/3/1989 0:51
1775,1775," Wow, that is fast. How many books a day is that? ",6/2/1980 2:31
1776,1776," More than I read, which is 1 per month...",1/6/2012 1:12
1776,1776, That's pretty good. Did you know Ender's Game is suggested reading for Military Organizations? Seems sort of weird. I thought the movie sucked.,6/4/1977 16:11
1776,1776, I never saw the movie. Didn't read the book either. Starship troopers was terrible. I did see that...,5/31/1997 9:28
1776,180," I thought it was campy, but I never read the book. It's been a long time since I've seen it though. ",2/13/1979 21:21
1776,180, Can you imagine a moral panic because of reading?,6/24/2003 17:45
1776,180," No, it seems foreign to me. Anyways nice chatting with you!",4/9/2013 15:21
1776,1776," Good morning, are you a fan of superheroes?",11/28/2019 23:38
1776,1776," I love superheroes, I am big fan of all the movies and shows. How about you?",9/26/1970 6:48
1776,1776, I am as well. I prefer the Marvel movies to DC. Do you have a preference?,6/9/1975 15:04
1776,1776," Me too, Marvel much better! Did you know there are 300 superheroes in the US",4/26/2009 8:40
1777,1777, I did not know that. Does that mean there are people who have registered themselves as superheroes or trademarks?,2/3/2002 17:04
1777,1912," I wonder if they register themselves. I registered myself, my name is normalman, just a average man",5/6/1970 7:35
1777,1912, Have you seen any of the latest Marvel movies? I have not seen Captain Marvel yet.,6/24/1974 9:47
1777,1777," I have not, looks interesting. I like anything Stan Lee so it should be good. What else do you do for entertainment?",6/26/1993 6:40
1777,1912," I enjoy reading, listening to music and podcasts, and watching documentaries on Netflix. How about you?",1/31/2006 0:04
1777,1912," Nice! I still play old school nintendo from time to time, did you ever play that?",11/26/1986 21:34
1777,1912, I wish I still had mine. The oldest system I still have is my SEGA Genesis.,2/17/2019 13:24
1777,1777," nice, loved my a sega! Each had great games. I wonder how many colors the Sega had, Nintendo has only 54 colors.",7/29/1982 2:40
1777,1912, I do not know. I recently got an XBox One that I won from a cereal box! Those contests do actually give out the prizes!,7/20/1983 16:34
1777,1912, no way! That would be awesome to win from just eating cereal! Which company did that?,7/30/1989 9:29
1778,361," It was the Kellogg company, I almost passed out into my cereal!",4/7/1996 0:09
1778,361, lol that would be amazing! Are you a Bill Nye fan?,4/29/2000 16:33
1778,361," I watched his show when I was younger, I haven't watched his new Netflix show however.",9/28/1988 8:07
1778,1778, I need to check out his new show. Apparently he got his start winning a steve martin look a like contest! ,8/27/1980 23:46
1778,361," That's interesting, I don't see a lot of the resemblance between them.",1/31/2009 13:48
1778,1778," I don't either lol, maybe a very young Bill Nye. It was so nice chatting with you!",12/8/2000 13:12
1778,361," It was nice chatting with you as well, have a great day!",5/24/2000 0:48
1778,361, Have you ever seen the movie Justice League? Apparently it's arriving on Blu-ray in 4K resolution,2/2/2003 20:15
1778,361," That is a great movie, that would be awesome in that resolution. I like superman! what do you think?",8/14/1979 9:05
1778,361," I like the movie Superman, but I thought Justice League was quite horrible. I don't think that the movie being released in 4k is going to save it LOL",10/1/1970 16:04
1779,1779," that is true, some parts of the movie was good, but I think they could have had a better flash. Superman's rights were bought for 130 dollars in 1938. Good investment ",4/10/1995 11:41
1779,1654," Yep I agree. It's too bad that the studio interfered so much with Justice League, it could have been a great movie but it wasn't",8/25/1995 20:32
1779,1779," true, isn't there a new one coming out later? Superman had the power once to wield Thors hammer",3/17/2019 18:54
1779,1654," Wow that's pretty cool I never knew that. And yes that movie was definitely full of problems, for instance they should have had darkseid be the big bad guy immediately at the start of the movie instead of at the end",8/28/2000 2:24
1779,1779, That is a good point. What else do you like for entertainment?,4/6/1995 22:26
1779,1654," Well I used to play a lot of Nintendo games as a kid, I never realized that they had only the ability to display 54 colors at once",10/24/1981 23:44
1779,1779," I loved nintendo, the original only had 54 colors! consoles have come a long way!",6/6/2001 19:06
1779,1654, I'm so happy that they were making Nintendo's until 2003! That's definitely my favorite system,4/9/1972 12:25
1779,1779," For sure, mario bros all day!  Those japanese make good systems!",3/11/1977 14:17
1779,1779, I agree! It's much better than using chickens for entertainment like the Romans did in ancient Britain,5/22/1995 22:10
1780,1780, For sure lol. Julius Caesar would have been more entertained lol,9/2/2008 7:00
1780,1780," I have never seen a Ronald Reagan movie, but it's funny that one casting agent said that he didn't look presidential, how wrong he was lol",12/6/1998 17:46
1780,1780," I heard that, if only they could see the future lol. Boy they were wrong!",10/25/1973 1:36
1780,73," Who is your favorite superhero by the way? I really like Batman, and I think that Garfield as a superhero could be interesting LOL",8/3/2015 17:54
1780,1780, I am a flash lover. So good of a show and awesome power!,3/2/1988 7:41
1780,73," I'll have to check it out, what I didn't know is that there are 300 superheroes that have been registered in the United States, I wonder what they all are and if some of them are better than the flash haha",2/25/2002 18:22
1780,73," I didnt either, wow! Good chatting with you!",4/21/1971 22:48
1780,73," Thank you you too, apparently Stan lee wrote 15 DC Comics, I always thought he was a Marvel guy",3/17/2001 16:04
1780,73," Hi! Have you seen Justice League yet? If you have and didn't like it, don't bother buying it on 4k. Otherwise it's just two hours of Oh what could have been . DC and Warner Bros really missed a huge opportunity travel a mark on the world of superhero cinema!",2/16/1974 9:32
1780,1780," I havent, but it seems like a great movie, DC and Warner Bros make a great combination, ",9/28/1978 16:33
1781,1781, Are you a fan of superheroes? I am and wish I could follow all 300 registered superheroes in the US. Ha!,3/30/1996 3:13
1781,1781," I am a fan and didnt know there were so many heroes only on the US!! Thats a lot of them, do you have a favorite superheroe?",10/31/1983 22:12
1781,1808," Honestly, I like them all but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd say Superman. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman and I'm so thankful he didn't miss the call for the role due to playing World of Warcraft as he almost did. That would have been disappointing! What about you?",11/2/2014 21:12
1781,1781," I like Superman as well, its a hard choice between him and Batman but the cryptonian wins the battle, he was created by Jerry Siegel, ",6/21/1978 2:49
1781,1808, Indeed he was! And did you know DC bought the exclusive rights to Superman for a measly  $130 back in 1938? That is unbelievable!,1/14/2011 8:22
1781,1808," They sure made a great invesment, Superman must be one of the most expensive heors now, $138 sounds like a sweet deal",3/19/2022 6:30
1781,1808, Agreed! Did you also know the writers didn't name Braniac after a preexisting word? They instead actually coined the term. That is pretty cool!,4/27/1989 8:48
1781,1808," It is pretty cool, Braniac is one of my favorite villains along with Lex Luthor, both pretty evil",7/8/1973 2:34
1781,1781," True. I think it's cool Superman once wielded Thor's hammer because he was worthy. Indeed he is worthy, in my opinion!",8/2/1978 15:30
1781,1781," I think that as well, he is the most powerful hero out there and refuses to kill his enemies, he would be a hard to stop villain",5/22/2016 6:06
1782,1782," He most certainly would! Since we're on the subject of Superman, did you know it's illegal to name your kid Superman along with Metallica, Elvis, Ikea and Veranda in Sweden? That is crazy - like would they really arrest you for something that silly?",6/16/1989 23:22
1782,1782," I didnt know that I wonder if many people wanted to name their kids after them, I guess those are popular names",2/17/1994 22:40
1782,1782," I guess so! But you know, I'd like to read some of the Superman and Batman comics that Stan Lee wrote. They say he wrote 15 and even reimagined the characters!",11/15/2020 15:05
1782,1743," Those titles must be really interesting, Stan Lee was a genius, Im sad he is no longer with us",8/27/1980 10:23
1782,1782," I am as well. The comic genre will never be the same. He created so many characters I loved to read about, watch and even play on the Nintendo Entertainment System! Speaking of which, did you know it could only display 54 colors. Isn't that crazy?",3/20/2009 2:34
1782,1782," That was a great system I really loved it, too bad the system got discontinued on 2003,",9/9/1977 21:44
1782,1782, It's kind of surprising as I figured Japan had discontinued it long before 2003! Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? I can't believe he got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!,4/17/2018 10:39
1782,1743," Yeah I used to like his show Bill Nye the Science Guy, and thats funny, he does look like Steve Martin do you agree?",7/11/2000 16:51
1782,1782," I think he does and that's a great way to get famous by looking like someone. But then again, Ronald Reagan lost out on a role because a movie executive didn't think he looked presidential. How ironic is that? Ha! Well, it was nice chatting with you today! Take care and have a great day, friend!",2/14/1997 8:12
1782,1743," That is ironic lol, he definetely showed them how mistaken they were, and you have a great day as well my friend. ",6/20/1975 23:28
1783,1783, Do you like to read?  I enjoy Stephen King books.  My first question would be to definitely ask him what I should be reading.  He does admit that is the most frequent question he gets.,6/2/2007 8:18
1783,1783," Hi, I love to read. There is so much to read. Did you know about a guy who while imprisoned spent most of the time in the library?",10/28/1971 0:05
1783,1783," I remember hearing that before, very crazy!  I just learned that Stephen King was in a band with Matt Groening.  Makes me want to rewatch some Simpsons horror episodes!",10/2/2009 12:14
1783,1783," LoL cool, what a combination. Did you know the movie Bambi, terrified Stephen King?",12/2/2001 10:02
1783,1793," I did not know that, but I think it scared me a bit too when I was that age.  Speaking of terrifying, Ronald McDonald being one of the inspirations for It is hysterical!",5/19/1979 18:29
1783,1793," Ronald Mc Donald is creepy, but It never stopped me for going to Mc Donalds.  Did you know there is more libraries than Mc Donalds in the US.",12/23/1986 1:01
1783,1783," That is wild!  I need to publish a book in Norway, you are guaranteed to sell at least 1,000!",11/3/1975 2:25
1783,1793, Great incentive !! and they promise to take it to different libraries of the country.,4/20/1986 10:49
1783,1783, That is great.  Speaking of books I am not sure I ever realized Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally from Parks and Recreation were actually in love until they released their recent book.,4/19/2019 22:49
1783,1783," Interesting question!! you know ? the book All you can ever know  by Nicole Chung sounds captivating, she was adopted in Korea and raised in Oregon and is in search of her roots",12/10/1995 14:29
1784,1784, Very interesting.  I am all on board with the library of things they have in Sacramento where you can rent out things that you need for a short period of timelike sewing machines.,6/12/1997 23:39
1784,324, That will save some space at home and make us avoid buying what we hardly ever need!  did you ever hear about William Gladstone?,4/29/2010 18:51
1784,1784," I am not familiar with Gladstone, but recently learned his story of using his wheelbarrow to transport 32,000 books at age 85.  I would love to be in that kind of shape at 85!",4/5/2010 17:41
1784,324," That is so cute. He was an UK prime Minister, but I think is great he did not say well I am too old to accomplish my goal!!!",5/24/1996 4:13
1784,1784," Yup, sounds like quite the avid reader.  I find it great that when it comes to reading their are no concrete laws, but that each reader can interpret what they want how they want it.",3/20/1982 5:40
1784,1784, Yes it is a complex process in the brain and unique on each of us. It promotes creativity.,4/8/2006 12:04
1784,1784," Yes, funny to think it was only 300 or so years ago that a moral panic ensued over the spread of reading novels.",10/10/1974 5:08
1784,1784," Wow that is almost hard to believe, did you hear about you laugh, you loose  competitions?",9/20/1992 5:36
1784,324, I did not know about that until recently either!  I would have never guessed Tolkien had a sense of humor!,3/19/2009 7:29
1784,1784," I would have lost,  but they did it while reading terrible poetry.. that has to be hillarious",1/30/2009 21:13
1785,1827, Poetry has to be the deepest exploration of texts in terms of interpretation.  Fifteen people can read the same short poem and interpret it all different ways.,7/2/2017 12:14
1785,1785, very subjective. Well great chat. Have a good day,5/10/1987 10:05
1785,1827, Do you like to read?,5/31/1988 6:18
1785,1785," I like to red my son bedtime stories, thats about as far as it goes.",3/12/2004 2:00
1785,1785," I have some recomendations for you, in case you decie to pcik a book, one of them Elevation, thats a great book",11/7/1999 22:17
1785,1785, Oh yeah. Whats it about.,11/15/2012 9:54
1785,1827, Its a book by Stephen King its about a man who faces challenges and tries to find common fround ,8/16/1990 17:18
1785,1827, Cool. I might check it out.,1/11/1988 17:33
1785,1827," You should, also a book called All You Can Ever Know: A memoir, that is also a great book",11/16/1978 17:44
1785,1785, Is that by stephen king as well.,11/2/2001 7:14
1786,1786," No, thats a book by Nicole Chung you can buy it for about $26",8/23/1990 2:25
1786,1786, I doubt I will end up buying it. I may go see if the library has it.,8/28/2012 18:18
1786,80," You can also search for The Flame: Poems Notebooks, thats another recommended book",9/24/2012 10:43
1786,1786, I hear starship troopers  is endorsed by muh of the military.,2/22/2018 23:49
1786,80," The book is highly recommended by the millitary, ",10/29/1996 23:21
1786,1786, Have you read it.,6/9/2009 4:49
1786,80," No I havent red that one, Enders Game is another great book, I liked the movie and I did read that one",10/27/1980 12:59
1786,1786, That one is also suggested material by the military.,10/20/2016 8:44
1786,80," Yeah its also on the list, did you hear about Anne Jones and her record?",2/6/1993 12:16
1786,1786, Yes for speed reading. 4700 words per minute. Wow.,2/4/1985 12:42
1787,1787," That is amazing, top speed, I wonder if she comprehends the books she reads ",12/6/2003 21:38
1787,1814, I would say they tested her in some way.,11/16/1991 18:52
1787,1814," That must be difficult to meassure, she must be really smart.",7/14/1978 8:34
1787,1814, Hi!  Do you like to use the library?,12/17/1998 7:04
1787,1814," Hi there! I'm a big time reader, but I'm not so much a library guy anymore. How about yourself?",12/15/1997 10:23
1787,1787, I used to use the library a lot more before the internet came along.  Now I still use to get books. ,8/7/1977 20:23
1787,1787, Do you have a favorite author?,3/14/2021 13:21
1787,1814, Not really but I do like Stephen King!,7/24/1980 10:06
1787,1787, So many of his books have been made it movies it's incredible. I don't think I've actually read any of his books though.,7/14/2008 17:59
1787,1787," I read some of them when I was younger.  Now I mainly read autobiographies, history, business, investiong, and sports books.  lol  Almost all of his books are connected.",1/6/1974 8:14
1788,1788," I just read Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann, I highly recommend it.",10/20/2011 12:55
1788,1788, I'll have to check it out.  I'm not familiar with him.  Stephen King's books have sold more than 350 million copies.  Whoa.  I didn't know he sold that many!,11/26/1981 16:18
1788,1788, Yeah he think he's one of the best selling authors of all time. I must have made some serious money. I wonder what his net worth is.,5/4/1977 12:04
1788,1788, Has to be millions for sure!  lol  He played in a band with Matt Groening.  Who is that?,11/2/1979 19:38
1788,649, Isn't that the guy who created the Simpsons? That's so crazy that those two guys are friends.,7/10/2005 20:04
1788,649, I didn't know that.  That is crazy then! lol,1/3/1993 13:19
1788,649, Have you read any of the Game of Thrones books?,12/5/2014 13:17
1788,649, I haven't is it better than the show?,12/10/1976 21:02
1788,1788, The earlier books most definitely were. The latest ones the author kind of stretched his world too far. It's probably why he's having a tough time finishing the story.,9/23/2005 2:54
1788,649, I'll have to put that on my reading list.  I tend to read more during the winter months.  Did you know that Starship Troopers is on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 military branches?,6/2/1997 4:52
1789,1662, I wonder why that's on the reading list. I heard Ender's game is a popular read list item for the military as well.,12/27/1999 11:29
1789,1662, I saw that.  Do you know who Anne Jones is?,6/21/2004 20:27
1789,1662," Sounds familiar, does she hold a record of some sort?",11/24/1971 18:01
1789,1789," Yes.  She holds the world record for speed reading with 4,700 words per minute.  I wonder if she was able to comprehend what she was reading.",2/6/1973 16:24
1789,1789," Yes, how do you think they test that? She must able to relay the information back or something right?",3/20/2004 0:11
1789,1789, I would guess so. lol  It's been fun chatting!  Have a good one!,6/8/2018 1:59
1789,1662, What a tragedy that someone was murdered over a pair of shoes! ,6/10/2001 4:38
1789,1662, I cannot believe that regular people spend a lot of money on shoes.  ,8/9/2011 7:08
1789,1789," Me either!  I understand that it's a status symbol, but that's ridiculous",8/16/1988 19:32
1789,1789, I sympathized with Ms. Smith,10/9/1987 3:56
1790,1790," I don't know about that, I do sympathize too but I don't think his mother is at fault",4/6/1976 23:22
1790,1274, She was not at fault.  In general I would not want to buy my kids fancy shoes or cars that would attract attention from bad people.,11/11/2017 17:46
1790,1274," That's true, especially in a high-crime area like D.C. ",7/18/1976 14:18
1790,1274, That was what I meant earlier.  ,7/3/2012 22:26
1790,1274, I understand!  It's strange how footwear is considered a cultural phenomenon these days,10/24/1989 14:26
1790,1274," It has to do with marketing by shoe manufacturers, such as Nike.",8/6/1977 2:07
1790,1790," That's true, and with endorsements from professional athletes it makes them an aspirational product ",3/21/2016 12:53
1790,1790, Michael Jordan often represents Nike. Kids love him.,11/23/1994 11:52
1790,1790, Yeah!  (Loved him in Space Jam)  I always thought it was neat that they used him as the Air Jordan logo ,11/9/2022 16:51
1790,1274, I admire him too.  ,12/16/2019 18:13
1791,324, Did you know that wasn't even how he jumped when he played basketball?  He was doing a ballet jump! ,5/30/1982 9:13
1791,1791, I did not know that.  Thank you for informing me since he is one of my favorite athletes.,9/16/1991 14:42
1791,324, It's fascinating how specialized our footwear is to be tailored to different sports.  Like cleats!  Who would have thought?,4/16/1977 18:52
1791,1791, True.  You seem knowledgeable about shoes.,11/24/2003 9:57
1791,1791," A little bit!  I've worn many throughout my lifetime.  I even used to do ballet, did you know that professional ballet dancers go through a new shoe every performance?",9/15/1998 3:53
1791,1791, What else can you tell me about Michael Jordan?,9/26/2010 11:02
1791,324, He made more money from his Air Jordan royalties than he ever did in his entire NBA career!,9/12/2001 14:58
1791,324," I did not know that.  Going back to your previous question, I did not know about ballet dancers and new shoes for his or her every performance.",5/3/2006 17:36
1791,324," That's for pointe shoes, at least",4/19/1974 12:11
1791,324, I read that Marbury promoted inexpensive ballet shoes.,5/9/1999 0:41
1792,1792, Yes!  And wasn't even paid to endorse them,1/1/1993 9:55
1792,900, Sup? I just read a single google search requires more computing power than the moon landing,4/23/1990 11:20
1792,900, I thought the Google stuff was interesting. I'd like to see some reforms to reduce its monopoly power.,10/4/1972 15:12
1792,1792," Yea, they have too much access to data. Google maps calculates traffic by tracking android devices",12/12/1983 2:52
1792,1792," Re the moon shot and computing power, I remember reading that the only way they could find parts to keep the space shuttle running was to search through abandoned hospitals and electronic junkyards for early 80s generation computer hardware.",4/10/2017 17:41
1792,1792, That's crazy. Did you know the UN has an ambassador to extraterrestrials?,9/3/2012 22:45
1792,1792, I just saw that! I had no idea. But I guess it couldn't hurt to be prepared.,3/6/1985 22:24
1792,1792, It's possible they visited earth earlier. Humans have only been on earth for the equivalent of 1 minute and 17 seconds of earth's entire history,10/18/1973 1:59
1792,900, True. Personally I doubt it -- I suspect intelligent civilizations are so far apart that contact is pretty rare. But I really hope something like a faster-than-light drive is possible so we an meet each other.,12/31/1974 23:28
1792,1792, That would be cool. Hopefully we find new planets soon 80 percent of earths forrest have been destroyed,12/15/1992 6:22
1793,1793, Absolutely. I hope exploring the solar system and settling other planets is cheap enough to be feasible soon.,12/3/1980 16:54
1793,1870," Yea, earth has a lot of issue, it will be virtually helium-free by the end of the century",1/2/1972 7:31
1793,1870," I wonder why just now, as long as it's been in the atmosphere.",10/13/1976 10:43
1793,1870," Maybe it's man made or just natural. When earth was first formed a day was 5.5 hours long, maybe that contributed to it some way",12/30/1979 3:59
1793,1870, I think the earth slowed down because of the moon's gravitational pull. I guess that means the days will keep getting longer.,7/26/1974 17:20
1793,1793," yea, when earth formed 4.5 billion years ago and didn't have a moon at first",7/10/1990 23:15
1793,1793, IIRC the moon supposedly resulted from a large body passing close enough to pull a big chunk of material out of the earth.,8/17/2004 3:31
1793,1870, Yea and now the moon effects ocean tides and stabilizes the Earth's rotation,5/10/1981 12:30
1793,1793," Yeah, it's cool to think of those enormous masses of water being pulled back and forth by the moon's gravity.",4/12/2007 15:31
1793,1870," Yea, 71% of the earth is water so it has a huge impact on Earth",10/25/2010 17:34
1794,424, Just imagine if it was closer! I think it could get within about 20000 miles before gravitational forces were enough to pull it apart.,3/6/2010 7:01
1794,1794, I wonder what effects it has on Earth's polar regions covered in ice,2/21/1985 4:04
1794,424, lion king was the first disney film to be dubbed in zulu,7/7/1981 14:04
1794,424, The Lion King was a movie about Africa! That's great that they put it in an African language. ,10/2/2016 18:44
1794,1794, yes it was for its african release. so smart of them,12/7/2017 9:33
1794,424," Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. I wonder how many languages it was dubbed into. Probably not Zulu, but you never know.",4/14/1978 22:56
1794,424, how do you even direct an animated movie? Its not like you need to tell the actors what to do. lol,2/5/2021 14:51
1794,1794," I guess they get performances out of the voice actors, change the lines, stuff like that.",11/22/2016 18:15
1794,424, makes sense. I never realized that there was a walt disney pictures that is a subsidiary of walt disney studio which is owned by the walt disney company. man how do they keep all of that straight,4/2/2012 16:12
1794,424," I guess for legal reasons they want the name DIsney on everything. There are the theme parks, the movies, the merchandise. It's a huge company. The toy industry gets involved in Disney animations even before the beginning of the film production.",10/21/1981 19:05
1795,1552, wow wreck it ralph started in the late 80' s,1/29/2012 17:39
1795,1552, I guess the technology wasn't read yet for that animated feature. Did you ever play Nintendo?,1/18/2009 5:32
1795,1795, yes we still do.,9/27/2003 1:32
1795,1795," Did you play the NES, the original system? It had only 54 colors.",4/8/1970 8:13
1795,1552, and it wasnt discontinued in japan until 2003!,1/20/2013 14:38
1795,1552, I guess fans were still playing the thing. I wonder who was developing games at that point though. Do you think Reagan looks presidential?,4/13/2001 14:14
1795,1795, i guess people thought that way because he was a movie star before he was president. i mean schwarzenegger doesn't look very governerish,9/9/2017 19:53
1795,1552, That's true. Perhaps even Bill Nye could end up looking presidential.,5/17/1971 21:39
1795,1795, maybe not presidential but definitely steve martin,7/10/1998 9:30
1795,1795," With the right makeup, make Bill Nye could look presidential. ",10/1/1996 12:19
1796,1796, did you know elsa was supposed to be the villain but let it go was so uplifting that they changed the whole movie,1/7/2010 22:01
1796,725," I never saw that film. It sounds like it's another Disney winner. Great story, great animation, great songs.",9/1/1976 16:33
1796,725, yes it was,9/23/2019 12:20
1796,725, It's funny that Disney renamed Rapunzel to Tangled and Snow Queen to Frozen because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming box offices. Maybe it's the title. I wonder how many boys watch those films.,3/8/1980 11:26
1796,725, they do good with having strong male characters that boys can enjoy,7/28/2018 6:00
1796,725, I would think its hard to learn soccer on a desert field,9/6/1998 20:54
1796,1796, You know I think that would be pretty difficult too! Good thing they were able to go to Maryland and advance their skills. Are there any resources in your community for refugee children?,6/23/2009 2:05
1796,1796, Not that I am aware of; I don't think we have any refugees,10/18/1991 13:07
1796,725, Interesting. Well that's good that there are places around the world that do offer those supports. ,4/28/1976 7:16
1796,725, The LACES program was a great idea; its suprising that Liberia has been at war about as long as we have,3/9/2007 8:31
1797,1843, I also think it was a very good idea! Something else really cool about the article is what it said about Youtube! I can't believe Justin Bieber's song is considered the most disliked! haha. ,6/6/1978 4:18
1797,1797, Definitely gets my vote for worst...lol,8/8/2016 19:25
1797,1797, There are children who are becoming millionaires just because they open up their presents on video and kids want to watch them. At the very least Justin Bieber performed a skill haha. ,12/21/1998 0:08
1797,1797, I must have watched gangnam style a million times myself,10/24/1982 12:21
1797,1797, I don't think i've ever watched a child open a gift on youtube lol. It was also shocking knowing that kids were wanting to watch others play pokemon. ,12/5/1999 1:28
1797,1843, Do you watch the ones where they eat tons of food?,4/15/2017 13:58
1797,1843," I can not say that I do, but I have heard that there are people who eat specific food items that I guess sound 'refreshing'. For example, there was an African American woman who would eat her dill pickle into a microphone. ",6/4/1987 11:42
1797,1843, Have you watched the bluetbe channel?,3/10/2002 23:58
1797,1843," I have not, have you?",8/18/2017 0:02
1797,1843, I subscribe to the channel and watch videos they post every few days,7/23/1971 23:37
1798,1798, What kinds of videos do they post? I imagine it being like COPS and they just show them chasing after criminals.,9/9/2008 5:30
1798,1798, Training and lessons learned vids,5/14/2008 18:07
1798,722, Very interesting. I think it's kind of unfortunate how police officers have been depicted so negatively due to the couple of bad apples. ,4/30/2016 22:13
1798,722, Youtube trails only Google for largest search engine,4/14/1990 0:27
1798,1798, I'm surprised Youtube is still even popular due to the rise of social media and the many platforms that allow people to view videos. ,11/21/2012 5:29
1798,1798, Happy Holidays to you!,8/22/1970 17:12
1798,722, Have you used spotify?,3/8/1997 9:57
1798,1798," I tried it out once, but didn't stick with it. I liked that it's basic features were free. I couldn't find songs I liked though",8/10/1979 3:49
1798,722, Yeah there is  a lot of songs on the service. Did you know that is has over 4 million songs that haven't even been played once? That's apparently 20 percent of their songs!,7/31/1999 17:30
1798,1798," That is crazy! 4 million unplayed! With so many millions, I should give it a try again. Maybe I should try the paid subscription, with improved streaming quality?",2/23/2017 19:58
1799,684," It might help, but with so many unplayed songs it may be an indicator there's too many. After all, it takes 130,745 plays per day for a musician to earn minimum wage on the site.",10/18/2001 4:45
1799,1799, That's a shame for the musicians. I 'm surprised Google hasn't come up with competitor yet. Did you realize Google is over 20 years old now. It was founded in 1998!,4/16/2021 16:14
1799,1799," Actually I did know of that, but did you know that google's map changes depending on the country you live in due to boarder disputes?",5/10/1975 10:10
1799,1799," Interesting. Probably saves them from getting hate mail! Hard to believe it started with just two guys, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They only own 14% of the shares now, though. ",4/4/1983 4:20
1799,684," Yeah, but I'm sure that's quite substantial considering how big they are. They went down once in 2013 and decrease all web traffic by 40 percent!",4/2/1998 3:17
1799,684," That's nice. It's nice, too, that they at least pretend to care about the earth. They once used live goats to mow the lawns around the headquarters. ",1/17/2016 6:34
1799,684," That's definitely a good thing, considering 80 percent of earth's natural forest's have been eradicated.",7/28/1996 12:03
1799,1799, I wonder how that looks on Google maps! Only 29% of the earth is even land.  The other 71% is water.,12/22/2020 20:40
1799,1799," Ah yes that is true isn't it? Well I must go now, good talking to you.",11/16/1978 1:22
1799,684," This conversation was so short! Reminds me of how if the earth's history was a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!",6/16/1999 7:31
1800,585," Oh wow, that puts things into perspective.",1/24/1994 16:39
1800,585," Such a short period, and so much has changed on earth in that time. Days used to be only 5.5 hours long when earth was first formed.",9/4/2016 23:14
1800,585, Crazy to think we went from that to now facing the complete elimination of helium in our atmosphere,10/25/2013 18:32
1800,1800, I hope when extraterrestrials come they don't need the helium! Maybe we should talk to the United Nations' Ambassador to extraterrestrials. Can you believe that's a real job?!,2/19/1978 0:14
1800,585," I had no idea, how strange!",1/21/1989 19:25
1800,585," It sure is! I guess maybe they'll show up some time, even though earth is the only astronomical object known to harbor life. ",3/11/2002 21:12
1800,1800," Ah yes, but who knows considering the vastness of space? Had an interesting conversation, good day.",7/12/1991 14:58
1800,1800," Hi, do you watch association football?",3/4/2003 6:33
1800,585," I do not watch association football, and until reading this article did not know that this was an alternate term for what we call soccer.  ",6/30/1999 11:00
1800,1800, I've been wanting to watch it. Soccer makes more money than most sports combined worldwide.,4/2/1991 3:45
1801,810," That is also surprising to hear, but when you think about it so many countries participate and it's a global sport.  I also didn't know that there was a variation that involved 3 teams at a time-were you aware of that?",2/21/1989 8:14
1801,1801, I think so too. Jon Stewart was a very skilled soccer player and represented the US in 1983.,9/30/1987 17:04
1801,810," If it's the Jon Stewart that I am thinking of, he's a funny guy.  I have never heard of the German soccer player Mesut Ozil, but am now aware that he donated his bonus winnings from the world cup to pay for surgeries for children.",9/4/1977 21:05
1801,1801, That's awesome and good for him for doing that. We need more people like that in this world.,10/10/1978 0:13
1801,1801," Similar to Seren Fryatt who started LACES after seeing the joy it brought to Liberian women, it's an example of one person reaching out to others",2/15/2017 3:28
1801,810, Very cool. Did you know there is a variation of soccer in which 3 teams play at the same time?,12/20/1988 0:56
1801,810," I was not aware of that, I wonder how a winner is determined?",12/2/2003 19:58
1801,810, Not too sure on that one. American's call it soccer because that is slang for association football.,8/19/1978 16:25
1801,1801," Yeah, that's what I call it.  I only played in elementary school.  Have you ever played soccer?",6/18/2020 11:27
1801,1801, I also played in elementary school. My son plays now. ,2/22/1994 9:52
1802,1190," My children do not play soccer, but my son wrestles and my daughter has played baseball.  It's a good way to come together with other kids, like the like at the Total Soccer Area in Maryland-they would have loved to meet other kids like that. ",2/3/1986 17:04
1802,1802, Do you watch the Academy Awards?,1/9/1980 12:20
1802,1802," I do not, but am aware that they give out the Oscars.  Do you really think that Eminem has more oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, George Lucas,  and Bill Murray?  I find that hard to believe.",3/18/1986 13:45
1802,1190, I find that very hard to believe. Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 different times.,10/16/1981 15:17
1802,1190, And how do the Oscars win Emmy's I wonder?  They were nominated for 9 in 2013.  For the production of their show? ,8/13/1987 16:02
1802,1190, I have no idea how that works. Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars.,3/28/2011 0:42
1802,1190," I am not surprised at that, or at the fact that Walt Disney has 22 oscars.",7/29/1978 22:23
1802,1802," Wow that' a lot! Well, it was great talking with you. Take care!",12/16/1987 6:32
1802,1190, Hi. Do you enjoy movie trivia? I am a big fan of Disney movies which is one of the Big Six film studios in Hollywood.,4/16/1970 18:04
1802,1802," Yes I enjoy movies trivia, I always watch Disney movies especially cartoons.",8/10/1991 19:45
1803,947," I really like them, even though in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of their animation frames creating identical scenes.",1/3/2021 18:04
1803,1803," I didn't know that, Yes I would think so, in the 70's the graphics and colors weren't as good as they are now.",12/7/1997 6:51
1803,1803, I know they are so crisp and advanced today. Frozen was the first film to be directed by a woman.,10/15/1989 6:01
1803,947," I don't remember seen frozen, but I am pretty sure it was good, have you seen it?",11/1/2005 0:38
1803,947, I have. It was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale the Snow Queen. Its about a princess who goes to save her sister who's icy powers have trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.,4/2/2002 15:51
1803,1803," Oh I think that I have seen it, did the wicked queen became frozen at the end? I always like snow white, the movie.",1/9/1976 1:25
1803,947," It definitely has some frozen characters but like all disney movies they have a happy ending. They name them Frozen and Tangled because female names like Rapunzel, Snow Queen or Snow White even had started to underperform at the box office.",10/22/1988 19:56
1803,1803," OK, have you seen the Pirates of the Caribbean which made over $1 billion in the worldwide box office?",8/6/2016 8:06
1803,1803, I have! It was a great movie with great toys. Did you know that the toy industry is involved before the filming has begun?,3/13/1998 2:34
1803,1803," No I didn't know that, what about the Lion King, would you believe one of the best part I like about the Lion king was the song by Elton John.",7/5/2009 12:25
1804,448, Its a great song! The Lion King was the first film to be dubbed into Zulu for its African release. I think that's nice.,9/24/2008 13:46
1804,448," Yes, It was nice, do you get into much entertainments, such as music, dancing and video games?",10/18/2012 5:41
1804,448, I have played Nintendo. I had the original which only displayed in 54 colors!,3/13/2011 12:09
1804,448," I used to like Pac-Man, would you believe when caesar visit britain, people used chicken not for breeding, but for entertainments.",4/17/1991 13:19
1804,448," How funny. I suppose things were a bit boring before they had something as fun as a Nintendo, even though it was discontinued in September 2003.",12/11/1983 20:12
1804,448," Yes that true, Bill nye, science guy, got a break in entertainment by winning the steve martin look alike contest.",12/20/1972 10:49
1804,1804, Well this has been a lot of fun. Thanks for chatting and learning new and interesting things with me.,8/26/2008 8:10
1804,448," Ronald Reagan was rejected from a movie for looking like the president, It was nice chatting with you also",1/18/2006 19:58
1804,448, Keep learning new things!,9/27/2010 13:03
1804,448, Some people feel the holiday season begins right after Halloween.  Some though say December 1.  When do you think?,2/13/1990 13:58
1805,1135, i am from the school of thought that it begins around thanksgiving. what about you?,3/21/1992 17:46
1805,1135," Yes, that is about right.  Put the lights up then and start hearing the music.  ",11/30/2015 11:05
1805,1805, do you think mariah carey's song is a good measure of when the season begins?,7/30/1997 6:46
1805,1135, Well it seems that more people need Mariah in their lives than usual around the holidays.,7/13/2021 12:35
1805,1135," haha that's true! have you seen the movie mentioned in the article, Love Actually?",7/20/2020 6:11
1805,1805, I don't remember that one. What was that one about?,5/15/1990 19:35
1805,1805," it is a movie that takes place in the UK and follows a couple different storylines. i love it! actually, i missed watching it this year sadly",2/7/1994 1:47
1805,1135," Is it a holiday movie?  Did you know that on Spotify a musician needs to get a little over 130,000 plays to make minimum wage?  That's a hard business.",3/31/1976 11:14
1805,1805, it is a holiday movie! and is that total plays or does it have to be plays from different users i wonder?,3/9/2005 15:18
1805,1135," I don't know.  But there was a band that earned $20,000 from Spotify for a silent album and used the money to finance a free tour.  Interesting, huh?",12/24/2010 21:28
1806,385, what is a silent album?,2/19/2009 9:06
1806,1806, I was wondering that too.  Did you know that 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed already.  Sad.,4/27/2018 7:30
1806,1806, that is sad! what do you think it would be like to have a day that is only 5.5 hours long?,4/26/1996 9:33
1806,1806, Depends if I were sleeping or playing.  Earth will be virtually helium free at the end of the 21st century ,6/24/1982 11:34
1806,385," yes, so what exactly does that mean?",2/12/2007 8:31
1806,1806, I guess no party balloons.,9/16/2011 5:34
1806,1806," yes i guess so! that will be a bummer, i wonder what else will change on this earth",10/25/2002 5:56
1806,1806, Well in any case we'll apparently have ambassadors from the United Nations if extraterrestrials arrive,3/1/1985 18:55
1806,385," yes I saw that, I don't think I believe in aliens though. what about you?",2/24/1978 23:19
1806,1806," Don't think so, but who knows what's out there for sure.  Nice talking to you.",7/13/1997 14:34
1807,1807," Hi! So, I was not aware that the movie Frozen was the first Disney film to have a female director! That is actually pretty cool info. I have never watched it, myself, but now I might have to get around to doing that. :-)",9/30/1997 0:08
1807,1807, That was news to me too! I was also shocked to hear that they renamed Frozen and Tangled to avoid feminine titles. How stupid is that?,6/8/2021 9:58
1807,1807," Ha. Yeah. That is absolutely ridiculous. And what exactly constitutes a feminine title? I mean... Sleeping Beauty? Pocahontas? And then even things like Snow White and Cinderella. Everyone knows those are FEMALE characters, so yeah. I don't get that at all. ",9/13/1985 23:16
1807,1621, I wasn't surprised that Disney recycled a lot of their animation in the 70s. I noticed that even as a child.,10/27/1990 9:59
1807,1807," I never really noticed that myself, but now it is suuuuuuuper obvious. Instead of making new films, they are putting all of their energy into live action remakes of the classics. I know they are making a new Dumbo, a new Lion King, and a new Aladdin, right? I'm sure there are more.",6/9/1993 19:27
1807,1621," Yes, that's what I've heard too. I'm not sure I really think they should be remaking classics, but maybe that's just me. I was surprised Wreck-it Ralph was in production in the 80's!  That movie took forever to release in that case!",12/9/2006 10:49
1807,1621," YES! That was crazy!!! I mean, I enjoyed that movie. (I have a son, so we watch more of the rough and tumble shows than we do the princess films.) I liked it, and he loved it, but I certainly didn't see anything in it that should have taken 30 some odd years to make. haha. I haven't seen the second one yet, but I'm anxious, too. Considering the first one took 3 decades, I'm surprised they put out a sequel so soon.",1/23/1989 3:42
1807,1621," I guess they must have changed the plot a bunch or had to go back to the drawing board, so to speak, when the technology advanced...repeatedly. Ha. I guess they have it down now to release a sequel so quickly. but wow..3 decades. I can't even imagine.",6/20/2021 20:55
1807,1807," Yeah. That blows my mind, too. I mean, some of the best movies I've ever seen didn't even take that long. I don't know. I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan, and as quickly as they turn that stuff out - and keep the quality amazingly good .... well, it is just hard for me to imagine a cartoon taking so long. I didn't realize that the guy that voiced King Candy in that one also voices so many different Disney characters. The only think I really knew him from was that series with Eliza Dushku, Dollhouse. I had no idea he voiced characters, too.",11/10/2013 2:27
1807,1807, That was a surprise to me as well. Did you see that Bill Nye got his break in a Steve Martin lookalike contest? How cool is that?,4/14/1999 21:24
1808,1808," Ha. Yeah. He looks NOTHING like Steve Martin to me. As a sidenote, I can't EVER say Bill Nye's name without doing the little Bill Nye the sci-ENCE guy chant afterwards.) haha. And I hate when people talk about him without context because I always want to confuse him with Bill Nighy, which is pronounced exactly the same way), but they are two totally different people.",4/3/1970 19:34
1808,1604," Yes, I always have to say the science guy too! Have you seen his show on Netflix, Bill Nye Saves the World?",10/16/1989 17:10
1808,1604," I have not! I'm not even sure I've heard of it, which is crazy because I watch Netflix WAY more than any normal person should. Haha. Is it like an older version of the kid's show? Or is it something totally different?",7/26/1999 7:06
1808,1604," No, the audience for his new show is really for adults that watched his original show as children. ",3/7/2018 11:37
1808,1604," That is kind of what I meant. Sorry. I didn't word my question well. Haha. But still, that sounds super cool. I might have to check it out. I have been watching The Umbrella Academy the last few days. My son and I are about 5 episodes in so far. We LOVE it. I guess Netflix is having to find some alternative superhero shows to cater to the superhero-loving crowd now that Disney is pulling all of their Marvel stuff off Netflix for their own streaming service. ",5/3/2012 22:58
1808,1604," Is the Umbrella Academy mostly for kids? I don't have any children, and while I do like Disney, my tastes in TV usually lean more towards sci-fi/fantasy.",4/17/2014 8:50
1808,1808," Not at all! In fact, the language is a little rougher than I like my kid hearing, but he is 13, and I am sure he hears worse at school. No, it is more of... well... I'd say it has a bit of an x-men vibe to it, but it is quite a bit darker than X-men. But the basic idea is the same - 7 individuals born with extraordinary abilities are taken in by a rich, eccentric man who trains them to fight evil. But if you like sci-fi, you'd probably enjoy it. It has a lot of time travel elements to it, too. VERY interesting show.",8/10/1996 8:50
1808,1808, Cool!  I'll have to add it to my watch list then. Thanks for the tip! Did you see the part of the article where it says the original Nintendo could only display 54 colors? It sure seemed like it was a lot more at the time!,2/20/1972 13:27
1808,1604," I DID know that. I'm a huge video game nerd, so I love game trivia. Haha. Of all the things that have improved with time, video games are one of the things that amaze me most. We went from Pitfall on the Atari - a little BADLY DRAWN man running constantly to the right with an occasional jump thrown in - to games like Skyrim and World of Warcraft. It amazes me that it started out so humbly. ",10/8/1993 8:07
1808,1604," Cool! Yes, and then think, even before Pitfall, we had Pong! We've come a very long way in what seems such a short period of time, but well, it's been over 40 years since Pong came out.",8/15/1997 13:38
1809,1043," You're right. You're absolutely right. I had forgotten about Pong. haha. Still. The advancements there amaze me! Well, I have to say, I have really enjoyed talking to you today. :-) I'm going to run out and grab some lunch before I have to go tutor some high school kids for after school tutoring. :-) I hope you have an amazing rest of your day and a great week!",8/14/1999 14:20
1809,1043, I had a great time talking to you as well. I hope you have a great rest of your day and week as well.,8/12/2016 14:21
1809,1043, Thanks! See ya!,4/2/2014 6:05
1809,1809, Do you have a favorite album?,10/13/1973 16:08
1809,1809, Hmmm....good question.  That's tough.  I would have to say it would be the first album I ever got when I was a kid...simply because it was my first one.  It was a Partridge Family Christmas album.  lol  Do you know what the best selling album of the 21st century is?,4/19/2006 12:51
1809,1043," My favorite, it was hybrid theory by linkin park!",9/24/1974 15:21
1809,1809, Nice!  I remember when that one came out.  Do you remember the band Reel Big Fish?  They re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their songs to their old record label.,3/28/2018 0:16
1809,1809," That is  funny, they sound  family, what are their hit songs?",6/6/1990 19:35
1809,1809, Do you remember the song Three Strange Days?  It was popular around the mid 90s or so.  That was their biggest hit.,12/25/1987 3:35
1809,1043," for sure, now i do! Were you a star wars fan?",2/28/2002 0:43
1810,1076, I was a huge Star Wars fan because the first movie came out when I was 7.  Still have followed it and love it to this day. I had all the toys when I was little.,2/6/1983 15:29
1810,1810, So good of movies! Apparently george lucas became a billionaire because of those toys!,2/15/2022 18:24
1810,1810, I believe it.  They got some good cash out of my family. lol  In 2018 the entire franchise was estimated to be valued at $65 billion dollars!,9/8/1987 11:02
1810,1076, Then they sold out and sold to Disney. Disney was smart for doing that. I think George Lucas' wife had a part in some of the films,4/15/1999 21:53
1810,1810, Yes. She won an academy award for editing the film!  Guess she was in the right place at the right time and didn't hurt she was married to George. lol,11/15/1999 6:45
1810,1810, Wow that is awesome! Famous couple right there. they even dubbed a star wars movie in navajo,11/17/1973 3:32
1810,1076, Interesting!  There must be a lot of Navajo speakers out there to make it worthwhile.,12/25/1998 22:02
1810,1076," for sure, I wonder how many or why they thought of that",7/24/1988 20:37
1810,1076," Not sure.  James Earl Jones recorded Darth Vader's lines for the original movie in only 2.5 hours and was paid $7,500.  Not too bad and I'm sure he made a ton of money after that.",7/31/1974 20:13
1810,1076," I wish I got paid that, I wouldn't complain once lol! I wouldve asked for a pay raise for the next ones though",4/29/2003 19:21
1811,905, Me too!  I hear you on that!  lol  Jumping back to the albums....I find it amazing that Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the best selling albums of 2014...more than 40 years after it was first released!,6/3/1975 19:18
1811,1811," For sure, good chatting with you friend!",12/16/1991 0:00
1811,905, It was a pleasure!  One more quick question....Do you know a hit song by Drake I should check out?,10/31/2017 2:39
1811,1811, Bye!,8/18/1979 5:05
1811,905, Hey there what do you think about Disney movies? I really love the Lion King myself,10/26/1983 19:17
1811,1811," Hi, I love Disney too! I've watched just about every movie that they've made. Did you know they're making the Lion King into a live action film this year?",10/27/1974 17:08
1811,905," yes I did! are you going to see it btw? i didn't really like the remake of beauty and the best, so I will probably stear clear myself",6/12/1975 17:46
1811,1811," Yes, I'm very interested in watching it. I've heard good things about it, but anyways did you know that the Lion King was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release?",7/6/1987 23:45
1811,1811," no I didn't thats interesting though! have you seen the movie Frozen by the way? Apparently that was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman, I know that it made a lot of money so it must have been successful",4/20/1997 14:06
1811,905," Yes, I've seen Frozen before. It's so funny because it was called snow queen first, but Disney renamed it to Frozen because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming box offices.",9/8/1998 11:30
1812,565," haha that is interesting I didn't know that, and yes Jennifer lee directed it, and it made more than 1 billion dollars, thats insane and great for her I'm sure",8/3/1999 9:02
1812,1812," Yes, it's also cool because Elsa was supposed to be the main villain in frozen, but they wrote the song Let It Go for her, and since the song was so uplifting they decided to change her character instead of the song.",4/11/1999 16:34
1812,1812," wow that is interesting, funny with that song too, the co-author of it did some songs 4 South Park and also for the Book of Mormon, those are both pretty raunchy, pretty funny that he also did songs for Frozen LOL",4/20/2008 10:51
1812,1812," Yes, it's quite funny, and the co-author Robert Lopez is quite talented as well because he is one of 12 people that have ever won EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, & Tony), so he must be multi-talented.",1/12/1990 1:45
1812,1812," Yep it sounds like he is very talented. Back to Disney movies though, apparently the toy manufacturers talk to Disney before Disney even starts making the movies. I don't know how I feel about that, kind of scummy",9/30/1992 12:51
1812,1812," Well, I don't know about that. It sounds like good business sense to me, because they basically figure out how to market the main characters of the film before the film actually gets released. It's kind of funny though, because during the 70s disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies.",10/5/1974 4:37
1812,1812, Yeah I did know about that. I think one of the movies where they did that was the animated Robin Hood movie. That's a cost-saving measure for sure. Have you seen the movie Wreck-It Ralph?,7/27/1987 22:13
1812,1812," Yes, I have! I rented the DVD. I find it funny that it took such a long time in production because the development actually started in the late 1980's, but it wasn't released until 2012.",6/12/2015 7:45
1812,1812, Yep I agree with you! I did like all of the 80s Video Game references in that movie. What else do you do for entertainment? I remember I used to play the regular Nintendo back in the day,3/10/1990 15:45
1812,1812," I'm not much for video games (even though I do play with friends on ocassion), but I did find it interesting that the ninetendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.",8/16/1970 3:30
1813,1813," Yep that never seem to bother me, I never noticed it as a kid haha. I'm just glad that the system was as good as it was. And I'm shocked that it lasted until the year 2003 in Japan",6/23/1996 8:27
1813,1490," Yeah, me too, but anyways did you know that Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had that presidential look? Ironic, huh?",1/7/1985 9:01
1813,1813," Didn't know that! That's pretty crazy. I also would have never guessed that Bill Nye the Science Guy did Steve Martin look alike contests, although I can kind of see that one at least",12/9/1994 4:48
1813,1490," Yeah, that's pretty cool. I also find it interesting that Alan tudyk has had a role in every disney animated film since wreck-it ralph. He appeared in both Frozen and Zootopia.",1/25/1996 14:18
1813,1490," Wow that is interesting. That guy is a good actor though. You like Roman history at all? Apparently Caesar made a note, that people in Great Britain would breed chickens to entertain themselves and not for eating LOL",12/21/1992 9:26
1813,1490, Hello - Do you like Drake the musician?,4/7/2005 15:26
1813,1490, Hello. Not really to be honest.,3/5/1987 8:34
1813,1813, Did you know he graduated high school at the age of 25?,5/3/1987 20:24
1813,1813, I didnt. I know he visited drake university in the middle of the night.,8/26/1990 20:47
1813,1813, That's pretty cool. I saw he spent a ton of money on children's books during a tour in the UK.,12/10/2003 22:07
1814,1814, He seems like a pretty good guy. Did you know he was on the show degrassi,1/12/1980 20:33
1814,873, I did not know that either. The beat of one of his songs is sampled from Timmy Thomas' 1972 hit Why Can't We Live Together.,2/22/2003 15:31
1814,1814, Yeah. He played a boy who was paraplegic and pursues a music career on the show.,7/15/2000 0:25
1814,1814, That's pretty cool of him to do that. Do you like Linkin Park?,7/15/2017 3:44
1814,1814, Yeah they are ok. I guess.,8/8/2001 23:30
1814,873, Their album Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of the 21st century.,12/24/2016 18:49
1814,873, Cool did you know aerosmith made more from guitar hero than any album.,8/28/1981 6:15
1814,1814, I did not know that. Pretty crazy though. Two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turn 100 years old,11/15/1972 9:19
1814,873, Wonder how many albums they sold. Enough to retire I hope.,9/23/2002 19:23
1814,873, I would hope so lol. The Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums of 2014.,8/29/1989 16:28
1815,1815, It is a good album. Classics for all time.,2/11/2002 17:33
1815,590, I agree. I love Pink Floyd.,3/26/2015 10:38
1815,1815, do you know bob marley is still on the charts.,3/30/1992 16:09
1815,1815," I did not know that, but I love some Bob Marley. Makes me happy and want to sit on the beach and drink a beer.",2/16/2022 23:25
1815,590, Yeah he had some good ones thats for sure. It always makes me think of that will smith movie,4/17/2017 10:53
1815,1815, It was good chatting with you!,9/12/1988 14:34
1815,590," How's it going, do you like Star Wars? George Lucas did a great job creating it",6/5/1974 3:18
1815,1815, I love star wars. Do you like it?,11/7/1985 15:46
1815,1815," Yea, my favorite is the original 1977 movie. You?",11/2/1988 16:18
1815,590, I love that movie! Do you have a favorite character?,9/1/1989 0:48
1816,733, Probably Hans Solo although I didn't like the 2018 movie with him,7/8/2021 4:11
1816,733, I loved Han. He was so well written! I didn't like Solo but I did like the character. Did you see last jsdi?,10/5/2004 13:18
1816,1816," No I haven't seen it yet, I wasn't to interest since I saw the Force Awakens in 2015",7/16/1999 2:25
1816,733, The first 8 films were nominated for academy awards and were commercially successful with a combined box office revenue of $8.5B!,4/11/1981 15:35
1816,733," That is impressive, the entire franchise was valued at 65 billion!",3/16/2009 20:01
1816,1816, It is the second highest grossing film series of all time!,3/25/1994 5:20
1816,733," Yea, it's a good thing Marcia Lucas had a lot of input on the original trilogy or it wouldn't be worth as much",8/20/2014 9:38
1816,1816, Right? She was so instrumental in its development. Did you see what she contributed?,7/15/1978 17:31
1816,733," Yea, Marcia had the ideas with Leia kiss and Obi Wan's death",12/4/1998 11:24
1816,733, That's crazy to me. that and James Earl Jones only go tpaid $7500 for 2.5 hours of work!,5/15/1992 8:43
1817,1690, That's pretty good but nowhere close to the billions Lucas made from Star Wars' merchandising rights,4/6/1998 20:11
1817,1690, Right? I thought that was really low but people said it was scale.,11/21/2001 14:43
1817,1690," Yep, fox really screwed up that decision, they only saved 500k",11/7/2009 14:29
1817,1690, It did make george lucas a billionare though so he can't be too mad.,11/7/1996 1:21
1817,1817," Yea, speaking of billionaires did you know that Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still a best selling album in 2014?",4/3/1979 22:50
1817,1817, Wow! I had no idea. It was great chatting with you!,2/3/2022 18:58
1817,1690," So, when do you think Christmas begins?",11/13/1974 8:00
1817,1690, I think the season starts the day after Halloween ,8/16/1970 18:00
1817,1690," Wow, that's early.  But it's in line with what Google's research shows",10/15/1980 14:01
1817,1817," Its not the official start, but they do seem to skip right over Thanksgiving",3/31/1996 6:36
1818,1818," It's an interesting concept, to track a Holiday songs Google searches to monitor how people think.  Probably truer than what people would actually say.",2/7/2012 11:49
1818,1818, Leave it to google,3/20/2018 9:15
1818,1818, Google probably knows more about us than we do about ourselves.  It's a little scary.,4/4/1987 11:47
1818,1799, Yes. they are great at tracking Data,10/13/1976 14:32
1818,1799," These algorithms are never as good as they say they are.  I use Spotify and it tries to make recommendations for me based on what I listen to, it's never very good.",3/11/1992 17:52
1818,1818, Yes. But they will get better in the future,11/11/1981 18:59
1818,1818," You're probably right.  What I really like is the Google Earth tool, I love those map and being able to focus down on a street.  It's amazing that they have mapped the whole world like that.",6/22/1992 18:46
1818,1799, Yes. I have used that in the past myself. It works well.,11/5/1977 4:34
1818,1799, Even that's a little creepy.  Being able to look down on your neighbors back yard and such.,4/8/1974 22:27
1818,1799, Yes. Sometimes it is scary if  you think about it. Imagine what  governments can do if they choose.,4/16/1996 4:38
1819,1819, Probably already doing something.  There is probably a record somewhere of what I listen to on Spotify and what type of person that makes me.,1/28/1980 19:33
1819,1787, Yes. They can be as intrusive as they want.,11/13/1994 11:51
1819,1787," I wonder what they'd make of me if I start playing All I Want For Christmas, constantly in March.  They'd probably just think I was a lunatic.",3/28/1978 14:40
1819,1819, Or maybe that you were thinking ahead.,8/26/1973 4:54
1819,1787," Maybe I should really think ahead and get my Holiday shopping done now, play that song, and put up the tree.",7/10/1983 15:24
1819,1819, I know people who start shopping after labor day,2/21/1988 6:16
1819,1819," Well I'm going to say goodbye, log into Spotify, and play All I Want For Christmas.  Have a good day.",9/17/1990 19:21
1819,1787," I think the special camp is really valuable, it helps a lot of kids",6/25/1970 8:27
1819,1787," Yeah, it is a great opportunity for refugee kids to learn a great sport!",2/22/2016 5:35
1819,1787," It is right, like Quriesh Ahmad, he liked soccer, sports can really save the lives  of people",9/19/1985 20:40
1820,1820, I think the latest count is 95 kids signed up for the camp!,7/4/1992 9:01
1820,1820," Thats a lot of kids, all of them are refugees, escaping danger from their countries, kind of breaks my heart",3/20/1987 17:47
1820,402," It really does.  It is bad enough those things are happening, but to kids just kills me.",12/8/2010 8:14
1820,1820," I know right, thankfully theres a place that rescues them, the nonprofit LACES really does a good job",11/21/2002 19:20
1820,1820, They do!  I am glad to see a positive change in this world,9/23/1980 8:56
1820,1820," Yeah Life and Change Experienced Thru Sports, they also have a great name, says it all",12/23/1986 6:19
1820,1820," It really does.  Sports can provide so much for the youth, especially in places where there is no other reprieve from daily life.",3/18/2010 8:43
1820,1820," I think that the coaches that volunteer their time are also to thank, they dont charge and still dedicate their time to those kids,",11/25/1983 17:11
1820,402, Soccer truly is a world wide sport.  There is a German soccer player who donated his world cup victory bonus to  pay for surgery for 23 Brazilian kids.,8/2/1981 5:56
1820,1820," Do you know his name? that is a great deed, I love soccer by the way",12/24/2009 18:04
1821,1551, Mesut Ozil,10/17/1996 3:38
1821,1551," Oh he is a great player, do you like soccer?",12/21/1983 13:15
1821,1821, I do.  It is one of my favorite sports.,6/28/2000 7:06
1821,1821, I cant beleive there are more than 250 million players world wide,11/28/1987 17:13
1821,1821, It is so popular it makes more than most other sports combined!,5/9/2001 21:13
1821,1551," And its played in over 200 countries, that is impressive",8/17/1983 16:18
1821,1551, It is impressive indeed.  There is even a version where three teams square off.,2/10/1994 19:29
1821,1551," I havent seen that version but it does seem interesting, I might have to Google that like right now. ",2/4/1986 20:15
1821,1821," Hello there, what are your thoughts on basketball?",8/7/1979 10:18
1821,1821, I like the sport a lot. I just can't believe that there are only five players at a time on each side. It always seems like more.,9/26/1983 8:01
1822,1822," True, the dunk was so bad because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in college it got banned for years.",10/8/2019 10:31
1822,934," Yeah, I heard it was banned from college basketball for over a decade! ",1/9/2015 11:06
1822,1822," I think the NBA has changed a lot with so many more 3 point shots being taken, it is hard to defend that much of the court.",8/29/1982 2:38
1822,1822," Yeah, that could be. It's hard to believe that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid employee is either a college football or basketball coach.",3/13/1986 16:26
1822,1822," Well look at Air Jordans, that shoe accounts for 33% of all money on shoes spent on ebay.",12/5/1970 19:44
1822,934, Does it really?Did you know that Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA?,6/5/1973 0:56
1822,934," Yes it was around 1984 I think, I think this is what jumpstarted Nike into the powerhouse they have become.",9/9/2000 11:43
1822,934," Yes, rapper Drake even owns a pair of solid gold Jordan's.",1/25/1977 5:19
1822,934," I do think it has gotten out of hand though, a 16 year old killed another teen in Washington over a pair of Air Jordans.  That is sad.",1/30/1976 9:26
1822,934, That is sad. Murder over a $250 pair of shoes. Senseless.,10/15/1975 9:03
1823,1823, Yeah the defense claims the 3 teenage witnesses were lying.  They apparently were the only evidence.  Must have been ironclad.,8/18/2016 19:39
1823,1823, Terrible. I wonder if MJ did anything for the family considering he held the record for the single highest paid season?,2/28/2019 3:52
1823,295," I doubt it, I mean the logo of his jumping isn't how he jumps either.",10/23/2002 13:44
1823,295," Yeah, it's ironic that it is from a photo shoot of MJ doing the ballet move grand jete and had nothing to do with how he jumps!",8/26/2013 2:00
1823,295," I actually have a pair of Air Jordans from the 90s, I made sure to leave tea bags after I wore them for a while to reduce the smell!",4/12/1997 9:30
1823,1823," Oh, I've heard to do that with shoes. I find it amazing the Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes for $15 and was not paid to endorse them.",10/18/1991 16:47
1823,1823, Yeah there are some good athletes in the world like Steve Smith who leaves his cleats on the bench to remind people of homelessness and people without shoes.,12/13/1996 16:43
1823,295," I have heard about that. I find it interesting that not only were shoes around so long ago, but a pair of shoes 5000 years old performs better than modern day shoes.",9/6/1999 13:12
1823,1823," Goes with the saying don't make them like they used to, thanks for the chat.",5/11/1988 8:16
1823,295," Yes, agreed. Good chatting.",12/21/2007 2:14
1824,1824, hi,7/30/2000 18:47
1824,796," It's sad that our world is coming to this, teenagers killing each other over $250 sneakers!",7/28/2000 5:37
1824,1824, the society's morality is becoming worst,3/24/1987 15:16
1824,1824," Yes, at least on the other hand we can appreciate that there are people like the witnesses relative came forward and contacted authorities. ",1/5/2015 10:53
1824,1824," I concur.  By the way, do you know that air jordan account for 1 in every 3 dollars spent on sneakers on ebay",10/3/2012 1:25
1824,1824," I'm surprised, I am not that in to brand name shoes at all! I would rather a fun unique pair like the one inspired by the Wizard of Oz inspired shoes with the gps inside!",11/20/1990 10:36
1824,1824, Hahaha.  I have never bought a pair of Air Jordan.  YOu?,5/26/2008 23:57
1824,1824," No, I haven't I don't make that much money! I wear basic 2010's style sandals",3/15/2014 12:50
1824,1824, so do I.  I think it is such a waste of money buying trending products.,2/4/2009 23:46
1824,1824," Exactly I can't believe some people live so decadently, like Queen Elizabeth have people to wear shoes for them before hand so they are more comfortable, I bet that costs a lot and doesn't even skim the surface of all of the servants she has. ",10/31/2001 18:18
1825,241," Btw, do you know that rapper Drake owns a pair of solid gold air jordan sneakers weight about 100 pounds",2/7/2008 23:27
1825,241," That's exactly what I am talking about , that's just way too much decadence! ",2/4/1979 12:09
1825,241," Agree.  I am not a fan of such living style.  Btw, do you like basketball",10/10/1973 18:45
1825,241," Well, I never followed basketball much, but I did really enjoy the movie Space Jam- and I think a lot of my generation did since it was the highest-grossing basketball film of al time!",8/20/1974 10:02
1825,241," Yeah, I watched that movie, and I liked it",6/22/1996 15:43
1825,241, It was funny. It did make basketball seem pretty fun but I've never been able to follow all of the rules like understanding the different in points between a field goal made behind or in front of the three-point line.,2/23/1980 1:51
1825,241," Yeah.  The rule is a bit complicated if you do not watch the game often.  Also, do you know that a professional ballet dancer use 4 pairs of pointe shoes per week",7/11/2003 17:34
1825,1825," No, I didn't. I wonder if other professionals with shoes designed for them specifically, like mountaineers and skiers, use more than one pair like that?",9/30/1973 13:52
1825,1825, nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday,2/5/1999 23:38
1825,1825," You too, thank you!",6/24/1972 5:22
1826,997, Bye,9/14/2006 22:39
1826,997, Bye,4/8/1996 20:48
1826,997, Hi there are you a big basketball fan?,3/17/1994 22:43
1826,997," Not really, do you watch basketball much?",1/8/2011 2:23
1826,1826, I do. Are you familiar with Kareem Abdul Jabbar?,8/26/1993 7:44
1826,1826," Yes, I've seen him playing basketball and I think I've even seen him on late night shows. Are you a fan of his?",10/9/2011 15:44
1826,997, I was when I was growing up.  He dunked so much in college that they banned the shot for almost a decade.,6/29/2007 7:49
1826,997, Did you ever have a pair of Air Jordan shoes? I few boys in my high school did. They all played basketball.,11/28/1980 3:26
1826,997, I never had any.  Wish I did though.  Speaking of shoes....professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,3/15/1991 18:12
1826,1826, That's amazing! They must have such a passion and dedication to dance...and they must need very special shoes. Did you hear about the teens in the news and the Air Jordans?,2/17/2019 20:02
1827,1021, I haven't heard that.  What is the news about?,12/11/1994 10:44
1827,1827," I guess one teen had a pair of Air Jordans, and another demaded them from him. He ran away and was chased, said witnesses, and they heard gunshots soon after. It's terrible! Over shoes!",5/25/2001 1:42
1827,1827, Oh my gosh.  That's terrible.  I just read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shows.  I don't see how that's possible.,12/1/1991 3:44
1827,1827," I imagine they were made with thicker leather. People used to walk much more, I think, so their shoes had to be tough, right?",1/16/2008 21:48
1827,1827, I guess so.  lol  I have really smelly feet and they make my shoes smell bad.  Any tips on how to get rid of the smell in my shoes?,5/26/1986 21:36
1827,1021," Yes, I have heard that you can put tea bags or coffee grounds in nylons in them to take the smell out. Also I've hard of putting those fabric softener sheets in shoes. Seems legit.",10/22/1973 4:41
1827,1827, Ahh...sweet.  Thanks! LOL  Stephon Marbury (basketball player) promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15 but he was not paid to endorse them.  Interesting.,9/18/2020 9:15
1827,1021, That's very interesting! ...and I almost forgot to say about the ballet pointe shoes...Bill Nye the Science guy has a patent on those. I wonder how he got into that?,12/5/1996 13:46
1827,1827, Wow.  How interesting is that?  Never knew that before just now.  I like what NFL wide receiver Steve Smith does.  He leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homeless people without shoes.,10/3/2021 10:29
1827,1827," That's pretty interesting about his shoes, but I wonder what happens to them? I wonder if they'd ever do a show with pro basketball players taking homeless fans out to lunch?",8/5/1972 2:59
1828,1828, I'm not sure what they do with them.  That would be great if they did that.  There was a player who played in Cleveland that would take out food to the homeless after every home game.  I think he plays for Boston now.  He also does it when his team is on the road.,7/9/2018 7:42
1828,1828," That sounds like a great idea. Speaking of which, I have some old shoes I'm going to go donate to the homeless. TTYL",10/11/2020 21:25
1828,1828, Nice!  It was fun chatting!  Have a good day!,2/17/2002 12:52
1828,1377, Hi there.  You feel like being a little scientific today?,5/6/2005 1:23
1828,1377, Yes I am. Did you know Pluto isn't a planet? I thought NASA had reversed that decision a few years ago.,8/9/1986 2:17
1828,1377, Not sure what the status is now.  A dwarf planet?  Maybe that's the difference?,5/31/2007 13:18
1828,1377," A dwarf planet is still a planet by name. Pluto is not longer a planet at all. I think it was found to not be a solid mass or maybe too much gas? I think another planet, Jupiter is made of gas and rock, and it is still a planet. Decisions on space are strange.",7/1/2010 20:04
1828,1828, Constantly changing with more  research.  Amazing actually.  Wonder what they named that planet that precipitates shards of glass. Weird.  Almost sounds scifi,1/21/2005 21:30
1828,1377, You think that's SciFi? In 2010 an ambassador for any future extraterrestrials who might make contact was appointed by the UN. If decisions made with space are altered by more research- what lead to that decision?,8/24/1974 15:47
1828,1828," It's a tough job, but somebody has to do it.  LOL  The emperor of Japan is a scientist.  Didn't know that.",3/7/1995 19:35
1829,1202," Yep, his name is Akihito. He still involves himself in scientific research today. Harrison Schmitt is the only scientist to walk on the moon. Which FYI, along with the sun controls ocean tides. Boom! Science!",6/25/2019 12:35
1829,1829," Fascinating.  And to think when earth was first formed, a day was on 5.5 hours long.  Definitely needed daylight savings time!!!",3/15/1979 15:04
1829,1202," Heck no, you would lose or gain half a day. Big mess LOL! I thought they found life on Mars, but it's been reported only Earth harbors life.",5/24/1999 20:50
1829,1202, I thought they did too unless maybe some things that could sustain life as we know it.,5/14/1984 19:00
1829,1829, Maybe that's why I assumed they found life was because they found water. Earth's surface is covered in about 71% water.,12/13/1980 13:57
1829,1829, Was watching that series Mars.  It had factual commentaries throughout it.  Guess they're serious about seeing what exactly it holds for us in the future.,7/19/2007 23:44
1829,1202," I would like to know. We can;t be the only planet to have harbored life. Why are we so special? It can't just be coincidence. I mean if humans are but a minute if earth history was put into 24 hours, who are we to judge what's in the history of other planets. We barely know this one.",8/25/1973 20:59
1829,1202, Exactly.  We're just a speck out there.  Unfortunately I'll never see it.  Just great to see all the research continuing.,11/29/2003 4:51
1829,1829," Me either. I can only read about it and imagine. But at least them my imagination plays a part, and it's quite interesting. What if we have a mirror planet around another sun somewhere. Another planet being destroyed by humans. Well, my imagination just got sad. Dang.",3/17/2007 0:48
1829,1829, I've always thought along those lines too. Guess I'll go out tonight and look up at the stars!!  Great chatting with you and a great subject.,2/6/1999 22:13
1830,502," You too, space really is fascinating. It's the only things every one can see together from across the world!",7/23/1985 4:23
1830,1830, Nice concept. Something we all share.,8/9/1999 22:48
1830,1830, Exactly. Space and Earth is a gift to us all. Nice talk!,8/22/2001 22:18
1830,502, May the force be with you!!,2/2/1972 2:18
1830,1830, Do you use or watch Youtube?,10/18/1993 13:54
1830,502," Yes, i watch youtube all the time. do you watch youtube?",7/23/1971 18:59
1830,502, I do you can learn anything on there. In November of 2006 they were bought by google for 1.65 billion. ,11/2/1987 14:49
1830,502, I did not know that google owns youtube. you have a lot of knowledge about youtube.,1/14/1976 9:14
1830,1830," A bunch of useless knowledge, lol! What do you watch Youtube for?",8/12/2018 18:47
1830,502, i watch mostly people cooking and organizing.. it makes time pass,9/7/1990 4:49
1831,1921, Yeah i generally get music from there but if i'm stuck on something like fixing my car or computer then it's good to have. ,1/21/1998 7:48
1831,1831," i agree, i was able to learn alot of things through youtube, its very helpful at times. did you here about the momo challenge? ",5/31/1989 21:07
1831,1831," No i didn't, what's that?",10/16/2009 19:49
1831,1921," momo is telling kids to do bad things while their parents are sleeping,",11/4/1989 18:29
1831,1831, Oh my God that needs to be stopped immediately. I don't know how i haven't heard of this. What kind of stuff? I do know youtube is the second largest search engine on the internet.,3/10/1996 18:28
1831,1831," like turning on the oven, sticking forks into the electrical sockets, really bad stuff.",1/18/1988 20:42
1831,1921, Wow that's terrible. Netflix and youtube together make up for half of peak hour traffic. ,6/30/1971 21:14
1831,1831," im sure, i got my cable disconnected and subscribed to both nextflix and Hulu ",8/3/1970 19:08
1831,1831, Me too friend. Police actually have their own youtube its called bluetube.,10/26/2009 21:23
1831,1921," lol thats awesome, im gonna have to check it out. thanks",4/4/1991 17:37
1832,1505, Do you know who Kim Kardashian is?,9/28/2005 11:56
1832,1505," yes, she has a huge social media following. She's known for dating r jay and is now the wife of kanye west. ",8/16/2021 13:44
1832,1505, Right she also use to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant. ,6/7/1983 5:46
1832,1832, now she probably has more money than paris. ,5/18/1970 21:23
1832,1832," I'm sure, She even written a book. Nice chatting with you. ",11/21/1979 0:05
1832,1505, Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine on the net?,2/10/1992 2:31
1832,1505," No, I didn't know that, but I suppose it makes sense now that I think about it. What kind of YouTube videos do you like?",1/4/1984 9:07
1832,1832, Im into diy stuff and reviews on certain items. What about you?,10/1/2008 23:35
1832,1505," Mostly entertainment and celebrity news, stuff like that. I kind of love to hate the Kardashians.",8/17/1995 19:16
1832,1832, its crazy how much success they have! They're marketing team is really good. Being famous for being famous,1/18/1988 5:17
1833,1833," Yeah, but it's super weird. I don't think anyone ever heard of them until fairly recently. Where did they even come from? I don't know if it's because they knew the right people or what... I mean, the Jenners are known because (formerly) Bruce Jenner was an actor, but other than that, I have no idea.",3/27/1976 15:23
1833,1945, Kim use to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant. But got a lot of attention for dating singer ray J,10/2/2012 15:10
1833,1945," Ah. And then married Kanye. Good for her, I guess.",9/4/1973 14:11
1833,1833, Shes surprisingly not the only famous one in her family. Kylie has made a huge name for herself,11/10/2012 11:47
1833,1945," Yes, but again, she doesn't seem to actually do much of anything. Really I think the whole family could do with less attention. I do think it was a good decision to keep her pregnancy low-key, at least at first. People like to make a big deal about celebrities' personal lives when it's really none of their business.",6/2/2008 20:43
1833,1945," Thats true, they are just normal people deep down. But thats what happens when your famous. I guess its the cost of getting so much money",10/24/1983 6:21
1833,1945, It's honestly a little creepy how obsessive people get over celebrities. Like freaking out on social media when she wasn't in the Christmas card picture.,2/22/1987 19:50
1833,1945, Its not like they aren't soaking in the attention though. They are everywhere on social media,8/8/2015 4:23
1833,1945," That's true. Kim even wrote a book about how much she takes selfies and was a force behind the 'selfie movement.' So yeah, not really doing anything to discourage attention. And, as we mentioned, that's kind of all they're famous for.",5/20/1985 15:55
1833,1945, Kylies youtube page posted an 11 min video that documented her pregnancy,7/17/2005 8:57
1834,1870," Lol, so much for keeping it private. I feel sorry for all their kids. It has to be weird growing up with all that going on. Do you think they ever get the chance to be like normal kids?",10/17/2013 6:20
1834,1870, I highly doubt it. They grew up with the cameras in their face. I wouldn't be surprised if they are already considered social media influencers,5/18/1985 15:27
1834,1870," I'm not going to go looking for them, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kim and Kanye's three kids already have social media accounts.",3/11/1981 14:43
1834,1834, There is probably this family wouldnt do to stay relevant Somehow their tv show still runs,11/2/2007 6:27
1834,1834," Well, as long as people buy into it, I guess you can't blame them for doing what works. Kim was the highest-paid tv personality in 2015, making more than $53 million. I can think of a few things I'd do with that much money.",2/9/1979 20:42
1834,1834, Kylie is the youngest billionaire as well so I guess I wouldnt complain in their situation,11/29/2015 1:29
1834,1870, Do you follow Kylie Jenner?,1/29/1970 2:25
1834,1870," No, I don't. Who is that? What does she do?",4/20/2022 8:44
1834,1870," She's a singer, a pretty good one actually, she announced she is pregnant to the world during the Billboard Music Awards",10/23/2011 4:38
1834,1870, Is she related to Bruce Jenner at all? Or did she succeed on her own? ,11/9/2007 9:35
1835,429," Yeah I think Bruce Jenner is her dad, I think it was a mixture of both, having a rich and influential dad can always help",3/8/2008 10:47
1835,1835, Rich kids get advantages. It doesn't bother me so much when they actually have talent. So she's related to Kim Kardashian then.,9/18/1999 5:36
1835,429, Yeah the Kardashians are her half sisters.,10/3/2005 22:11
1835,1835,  Kim Kardashian used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant.,5/25/1971 14:31
1835,429," I think she's famous because of her dad, you know he was part of the defense team of OJ Simpson.",12/21/1973 4:34
1835,1835," Yeah, I saw a show about that. David Schwimmer was the dad. I think the family was different before the fame. Now Kim has a book about her being a trailblazer of the ‘selfie movement'. titled: Selfish. ??? LOL. ",11/26/1972 15:48
1835,1835," I dont know about that lol but I do know that Kim was in one of the music videos of the band Fall Out Boy, I used to love that band",3/11/1977 16:41
1835,1835, I don't know their stuff. I understand that she would bring attention to the video. ,5/25/1970 20:21
1835,1835," She is a curious character indeed, so do you like rap music?",2/14/2006 21:06
1835,1835," I'm not really a fan of rap, though I can see it takes talent to do it well. ",8/22/1977 4:17
1836,450," I agree, it must require a lot of talent, do you know who Eminem is?",4/8/1983 22:09
1836,450," Eminem is a famous rapper, though I don't his songs. I saw him in a movie called Eight Mile.",11/12/1977 11:14
1836,450," That was a great movie, sad how he had to struggle in the way he did, he almost became a comic book artist",9/14/1995 7:27
1836,450," He probably would have been a good one, though not as rich. He should start a comic book. ",8/10/1996 7:11
1836,1836," Now that he has the money it would be a good idea, maybe he can come up with the next Batman or Superman. ",6/7/2012 14:54
1836,450, That would be good. Or many a hero rapper that does battle through fiery rhymes.,9/10/2017 2:02
1836,450," Busta Rhymes is another talented rapper, he was he voice of the Reptar Wagon in the Rugrats Movie. ",1/7/1993 16:32
1836,1836, CLimate change is getting dangerous. The Carbon dioxide keeps getting higher each month ,12/3/2014 3:16
1836,450, We really need to start acting on this. The carbon dioxide has exceeded 410 ppm this is unacceptable.,1/16/1988 3:49
1836,450, Right!!. The gases are even getting bad getting to be 46 percent higher the last time they did a check in Hawaii ,3/28/2001 6:11
1837,729, That's bad. The carbon dioxide concentration are causing the greenhouse gas effect and trapping heat and driving climate change. People need to understand this.,2/11/2008 1:03
1837,729, The rising growth rate of this plant each year is making it harder to even handle.,4/2/1983 2:46
1837,1837, True.But Antarctica is losing tens of meters of ice and it's raising sea levels. This can be very bad.,7/5/1997 11:27
1837,729, sad to learn that 80 percent of the earth's natural forest have been lost. Whats next!,1/12/1973 6:04
1837,1837," Yes I know, very depressing. Helium we are also losing apparently but not sure why.",1/11/2021 9:20
1837,1837, mayeb somthing to do with the process of how the plants provide energy. Scientist are the ones who know the answers for sure. Crazy how being called a scientist only came around during the 19th century,10/21/1991 12:31
1837,729, Yeah that is kind of interesting. They are very important though. For example the World Wide Web was invented by an English scientist.,6/17/2005 0:20
1837,1837, very cool to learn. They start off very young know how to be awesome intelligent humans. much like the young john von neumann,9/16/1989 8:49
1837,729, Yes that's a very good comparison. Harvard scientist's managed to store a GIF animation of a galloping horse in the DNA of a bacteria how is that even possible?,5/10/1976 9:23
1837,729, It's something smarter than we can even put into words lol...much like how is our planet is the only one to have life on it?,6/26/1994 16:32
1838,1582," I also raise that question! In modern times, many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy  like academia, industry, government, and nonprofits.",3/21/1987 6:29
1838,1582, Maye its all our water. 71% of it is covered by it.,12/14/1971 14:13
1838,1838, So many deep oceans! Even on land there is much water like lakes and rivers.,11/6/1992 19:50
1838,1838," Oh yeah I know, I'm from Michigan, many lakes there....I did learn they have whole building blocks of other land far way from the earth. But we cant really get there",11/19/1974 3:11
1838,1582, Maybe someday. Earth is actually the densest planet in the solar system.,11/28/2017 22:09
1838,1582, Wonder what that all means to how we live. Wonder what it means that Uranus rotates on its side and rolls round the moon. So fascinating ,5/14/2016 8:09
1838,1838, Yes all good questions. I always wonder about aliens too. In 2010 the United Nations appointed a official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they would ever make contact with the earth! It was great chatting with you today I had fun.,7/29/1993 20:43
1838,1582, ET come home lol,3/28/2006 1:15
1838,1582," Hello, do you watch Youtube?",7/17/2006 23:32
1838,1582," Yea, I've been watching youtube since it was created in 2005",3/8/1977 10:07
1839,1839," Awesome,  love Youtube.  Its the second largest search engine on the net. ",6/3/1974 1:49
1839,1839, Must be why Google bought youtube in 2006 for 1.65 billion,2/14/1995 22:32
1839,1839," Yeah,  now google and youtube have the top spots of search engines.",5/25/1983 5:56
1839,1839," Combined with Netflix Youtube makes up half of peak internet traffic in North America, that's a lot of streaming",4/24/1973 8:22
1839,1839, Yeah that is insane.  Justin biebers baby video is the most disliked video lol,7/9/2004 8:14
1839,1631," Ugh, there most like video Gangnam style isn't much better either",11/30/1982 21:44
1839,1631," Haha thats a really funny video though,  it doesnt make any sense though.",7/20/2008 22:31
1839,1631," No, neither  does the youtube rip off blutube used by Police",5/11/1988 13:50
1839,1839, Is it just a channel on Youtube or a whole different site?  ,7/24/1998 18:00
1839,1839," I think blutube is just another site, I'd check it out but I honestly don't care",12/14/1991 12:09
1840,1840, Do you like Kim Kardashian?,2/23/1998 17:56
1840,1840," Not at all, she only famous for a tape she made with Ray J, in my opinion.",7/24/1974 20:37
1840,519," Yeah i remember that,  I guess she used to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant. I personally think that whole family is kinda ridiculous. I think she is married to Kanye west too right?",4/16/2005 8:23
1840,519," Yea, him and Kim have 3 children.",1/21/2007 9:56
1840,1840," Oh wow,  I guess Ive missed a lot lol I did not know they have 3 children now.  I know their family makes a lot of money for reality shows and businesses where Im pretty sure they do nothing. lol",11/8/1990 6:30
1840,519, Nothing but taking selfies and writing stupid books about it,1/23/2011 9:43
1840,519," Yeah,  and america loves it for some reason.  Buying their product and watching their shows,  america is just making them more money lol ",2/22/2009 6:05
1840,1840," Yea, none of their stuff will make it in the library of Congress like Tupac's music. Well it was nice chatting with you",4/15/2013 19:10
1840,519," great conversation, thank you very much. ",7/13/2012 3:46
1840,519, hi how are you? what do you think of this planet of ours?,12/3/2010 14:55
1841,1841," well what can I say, humans destroyed 80% of the earth's natural forests. ",9/9/1985 4:32
1841,1228," Yeah, we are well on the way to destroying the last 20 per cent too it seems. ",8/14/1979 11:47
1841,1228," yeah apparently the earth changed a lot from when it was first formed, The days were only 5.5 hours long.",10/7/1978 10:44
1841,1841," now it is just over 24 hours. soon it will be 30, 40 hours and the work day will be even longer. no thanks!",3/27/1977 17:42
1841,1228, yeah well at the end of the 21st century the earth will be helium-free,3/8/2000 20:36
1841,1228," maybe we can develop trees that produce helium! that would solve the problem. more forests, more helium.",5/14/1986 12:43
1841,1841," yeah that would be good, but I'm not sure how that would work with all of this climate change ",8/6/2020 4:52
1841,1841," Yeah, we need more forests. or we could move to another planet. that might be easier. LOL",6/10/1999 18:52
1841,1228," yeah we could move to Venus, it does not tilt so there are no seasons there.",1/26/1970 14:05
1841,1228," Yeah, but it's like 900 degrees. a bit hot. the soviets send a probe there. it disappeared pretty fast.",12/14/1974 15:27
1842,1842, maybe they can invent a space suit that could keep us cool. see humans are destroying earth but they should be taking care of it because it is the only place we can survive. ,7/18/2012 4:51
1842,1842, quite true. we need to think a bit more about the actions we have taken and how much longer we can keep doing the same thing.,8/15/2018 12:54
1842,1842, yeah 71% of the earth's surface is covered with water,8/3/2019 10:58
1842,452, we need to preserve the creatures there as well. overfishing and pollution are terrible problems.,10/6/1970 2:54
1842,452," they are very serious problems, I really hope it gets better",4/13/2015 16:56
1842,452," Well, astronomers have detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away. Maybe we could go there? Lets talk to Elon.",12/7/1991 9:32
1842,452," that sounds really interesting, I wonder if they have oxygen there.",3/12/1970 17:18
1842,452," I guess we could bring a converter. anyway, great chat!",8/23/1975 2:32
1842,452, thank you have a nice day,9/16/1986 3:57
1842,1842, Have a great day!,6/30/1976 18:42
1843,1267, bye,1/26/2013 4:19
1843,1843," Hi, how are you?",7/1/1974 18:25
1843,1843, Hello. What do you think about scientists?,3/3/1972 4:45
1843,1267, I love them! I studied science at college for 3 years. Then organic chemistry suggested I try another line of study. What do you think abouto scientists?,6/17/1980 7:02
1843,1267, I feel that scientists whose sole purpose to research to advance knowledge in a specific area of interest have helped advanced the world in leaps and bounds,6/17/1972 5:22
1843,1267, I do too! Do you believe them in their research?,8/20/1997 19:38
1843,1843," In most cases yes. However, I do think that each person has to do their due diligence to identify if there is any bias or misinformation.",6/30/1972 8:45
1843,1267, I agree. The only reason I asked was because of people second guessing the global warming research. Seems odd to me..,10/10/2002 21:36
1843,1267, I feel its because for many people of authority like the current president denies it for political reasons. I still can't believe people feel vaccines cause autism,6/3/1985 12:54
1843,1843, I know. Now there is a measels outbreak which will jeopardize the health of new borns who cannot get vaccinated. Just dumb...,6/15/1972 18:51
1844,1844, Scientists have also made vast contributions to learning more about planets such as the earth,6/6/1980 8:44
1844,1655, I am mad they got rid of pluto though. I had such hopes for that planet.,5/5/1970 19:44
1844,1844, When the problem was all in the current definition of things and at times it is simply a matter of semantics. Even jupiter's moon would be considered a planet due to its size and features if it instead orbited the sun instead of jupiter,10/3/2001 3:34
1844,1844," That is really insightful, thanks! Did you know the world wide web was invented in 1989?",8/11/2016 6:06
1844,1655, Do you know who invented it?,10/10/2017 23:49
1844,1655," I do not, who?",3/7/2001 9:51
1844,1655, I don't know either. I was asking lol. I'm sure it was a scientist. All I remember was that the internet was developed by the military and wifi was developed as a byproduct when the space program was trying to improve space imaging.,3/17/1981 9:54
1844,1655, Didn't al gore say he invented it? Then he got mocked by the press and then he was actually involved with it????,7/19/2004 13:27
1844,1655, If that is true that a shame,3/20/2014 13:13
1844,1844, Well at least the emperor of japen still publishes today.,7/5/1985 21:50
1845,1529," That is amazing. I wonder what his field of expertise and interest is. In modern times, scientists have changed academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments to an exponential degree",9/24/2013 11:12
1845,1529, I am not sure. It was nice chatting with you today!,8/20/1989 3:15
1845,1529, Hello hows it going?  Do you like reading?,10/1/1989 14:58
1845,1845," Hello, I am good thank you.  I do enjoy reading, how about you?",11/1/2018 10:16
1845,1845," Yes,  very much.  Did you know Starship troopers was a recommended reading book to us militaries?",8/12/2012 23:05
1845,1529," No, I didn't know that, I didn't even know that was a book. ",12/14/2008 4:00
1845,1845, It was a great movie too!  ,6/12/2014 5:46
1845,1845, Yeah I saw the movie it was good.  Did you know in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels?,11/11/2003 5:18
1845,1845," That is surprising,  reading is good for people,  why would there be a panic about it lol ",4/9/2008 8:10
1845,1845," I know right, back to the military, I guess Ender's Game was suggested reading for the marine corps. ",10/5/2006 11:14
1846,1846," Nice!  I never read that one,  just seen the movie.  ",10/29/1993 18:36
1846,1846," Also, the world record for speed reading was a speed of 4700 words per minute!",2/16/2001 3:43
1846,1846, lol now that's crazy! Do you even process information that fast?  or just read the words?  That is a lot! ,5/4/2001 3:13
1846,180, Yeah I don't even know how you could make sense of that many words that quickly. ,4/9/2018 20:26
1846,1846, yeah right!  It looks like the biggest selling non fiction book is the Bible!  ,9/3/1992 6:35
1846,180, I could see that.  Did you know that George w Bush read 14 biographies of Lincoln during his presidency?,5/17/2000 4:37
1846,180, Yes and almost 200 historical non fiction books!  He was focused! ,7/18/2019 16:04
1846,1846, Yeah I don't know how you could read that many biographies about one person though!,7/11/1994 9:10
1846,1846," lol I could,  if I was really interested in their life.  ",10/23/1998 6:23
1846,1846," But still, I can see reading 5 but not 14 lol.  I guess the FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an act of US censorship. ",1/6/1991 18:11
1847,383," That is a big statement.  I did not know that Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize,  that is interesting. ",8/28/1979 2:58
1847,1847," Wow, I didn't know that either, very interesting. ",1/19/2004 13:30
1847,383," Well it was good chatting,  have a good one. ",11/18/1972 10:25
1847,1847," Hi , do you like to read?",10/24/2010 5:11
1847,1847, Hi there I do like to read. What about you? But I guess I only like audiobooks haha don't actually read the physical book,3/6/2015 23:09
1847,383, I love to read.I found interesting that the Bible was considered the non fiction book that had the biggest sales!,10/16/2012 11:38
1847,383," Wow that is interesting. have you ever heard of the blind reading language Braille? It was created by Louis Braille who did it when he was only 15, that's impressive!",6/3/2014 12:37
1847,1847," Wow that is so impressive ,I had no idea he was so young , I will not forget that now.  Did you know reading novels was causing a moral panic in the 18th century?",12/18/1976 20:10
1847,1847, No that's really silly though haha. Can you imagine if people were worried today about everyone suddenly reading lol. Do you know what a reading bicycle is?,4/21/1993 1:01
1847,1847," no, tell me about it! something I know is that literature was, long time ago, an olympic event!",12/23/1970 9:36
1848,1481," Haha no, it was actually something they invented for schools. They would put a reading bicycle into elementary schools and apparently the test scores skyrocketed after that",5/25/1983 7:23
1848,1848," When there is something fun , it is way easier to learn. Did you hear bout a competition called you laugh you lose? ",10/5/2001 13:47
1848,1848," No I didn't hear about that, can you tell me more? Interesting that of Amazon's top five best-selling book, four of them were nonfiction, I wonder what they were",5/23/1983 18:37
1848,1481," It was a competition held by Cs lewis and Tolkien It looks like they had to hold their laugh when reading terrible poetry. I could not have done that, I would have lost",4/1/2002 3:15
1848,1481, Yep I would have lost too. Also I feel bad for the people that wrote those poems. Just think about if they knew who was laughing at them LOL,1/4/2013 21:13
1848,1848, Poor poetry writers!! I did not know George w Bush enjoyed reading so much,12/18/1981 16:05
1848,1481," I didn't know that either. Have you ever read a book by Terry Pratchett before? Apparently he was knighted for his work, specifically hisservices to literature",9/14/2008 18:08
1848,1481," I have not read from him, but it is a very good reference that he was knighted. Did you know that the fda did an act of censorship and burned 6 tons of literature?",5/5/2001 22:07
1848,1848, No I didn't know that. That's kind of scary actually. I wonder why they would burn the books? Did you know that romantic kissing is actually a recent invention?,3/19/1979 5:08
1848,1481," That is pretty cute, I think is interesting  that music , sculpture and painting were olimpyc events!!",10/11/2014 15:31
1849,1990, That is really interesting. I wonder how those work because they're so subjective? Do you like heavy metal? There is a professor who teaches heavy metal as a form of literature apparently,1/18/1983 13:41
1849,1990," I love rock, but I think that professor would have been burned by the FDA... talking about the olympic events for music, painting etc, this happened from 1912 to 1952.",4/22/1973 13:50
1849,1990," I see. Have you heard of President Andrew Jackson? You never actually went to school, it was his wife who helped him to learn how to read, and he became the president so I guess that's awesome!",4/12/1987 8:33
1849,1849, Cool!! it was nice talking to you! have a good one,1/9/1994 13:39
1849,1849, do you like reading?,4/3/2019 8:02
1849,1849, I do. Did you ever read Starship Troopers?,6/22/1994 7:21
1849,1990, Yes and it is recommended by the military branches as well,5/31/1975 19:34
1849,1849," Yes true, same with Ender's Game that is a popular one among the military too",9/4/2003 18:26
1849,1849, Yes. Do you know who holders the record for speed reading,12/13/1992 16:51
1849,1990, That would be Anne Jones at 4700 words per minute,4/6/1979 1:17
1850,1850, Yeah I wonder how they even measure that though to be honest,2/16/1984 19:12
1850,443, True. DO you know who TOlkien and CS Lewis were?,10/30/1990 17:14
1850,1850," Yes great authors and they used to play you laugh, you lose games with each other",6/21/1979 6:26
1850,1850, Yes and it must have been hard because it was over bad poetry,8/8/1979 5:38
1850,1850, Yeah. There was moral panic in the 18th century because people were reading novels,3/21/1980 14:17
1850,1850, Weird. Do you like non-fiction?,3/18/2014 9:07
1850,443, Yes I do. George Bush read 186 historical nonfictions when he was a president,12/9/2011 4:59
1850,1850," Yeah and 14 biographies of Lincoln, he must know a lot about him",8/20/1994 3:14
1850,443, Yeah I bet so too. Jimmy Buffet the country singer is also a talented writer,11/4/2022 0:45
1850,443, Yes he had a fiction and nonfiction reach number one in the NY best seller list,2/27/1999 18:59
1851,225, Nice. Do you know which is the best selling nonfiction book?,1/7/2013 17:20
1851,225," That would be the bible, it holds the guiness record too",8/1/1984 5:54
1851,225," Yeah, Did you know Jack London was really poor once?",9/14/2016 6:43
1851,225," Yes and that is what his book talks about mainly, the divide between the rich and the poor, in the people of abbyss",5/29/2016 9:51
1851,225," Yeah, that was early 1900. Nice chatting with you",12/8/1982 14:49
1851,1851, I really like to read. Do you enjoy reading?,11/15/1970 0:01
1851,1851," Reading is fun, and fundamental! How are you today? Have you read anything?",12/11/1997 9:05
1851,1851," I am good. I have read many, many books. Did you know that Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize for literature?",8/19/1978 12:32
1851,225," I didn't know that! However, I'm not surprised. POTUS Andrew Johnson never  went to school. His wife helped him learn to read. ",8/31/1989 13:38
1851,225," I'm very glad that someone did. Oddly, literature was an Olympic event from 1912 to 1952. How odd. ",5/20/2015 15:29
1852,1852," That sounds very strange! I've never heard that. I wonder why literature would be in the Olympics. Perhaps in combination with other activities, it would make sense to be in the Olympics. For example, an elementary school used reading bicycles and test scores went up.",2/15/2010 6:04
1852,992," That's interesting. I wonder why. It's not the only strange Olympic sport. During those same years architecture, music, painting, and sculpture were also Olympic events. ",6/17/1997 2:28
1852,1852," Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development, so I guess that wouldn't be in the Olympics yet. What about heavy metal music? Some guy in Texas teachers it as a form of literature. Could be in the Olympics someday.",9/1/1981 1:25
1852,1852, That's a good question. I was saddened to learn that the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of censorship in the U.S. That's upsetting. ,10/17/1993 0:41
1852,1852," Sometimes people think that they're helping when they don't realize that they are in fact destroying a legacy. I might not listen to heavy metal, but I wouldn't destroy it out of some sense of righteousness. Do you read non-fiction at all?",7/6/2011 19:38
1852,992, I sometimes do. I know that unsurprisingly the bible is the best selling non-fiction book. But I question how many of those are actually read. ,9/15/1973 23:33
1852,992," The book sells a lot, but few open it up. The Late Great Planet Earth is also a best-seller among Christians. It predicts the end of the world in our generation. Sold 35+ million copies. ",7/7/1975 6:13
1852,1852, I am not familiar with that one. Did you know that George W Bush read 14 biographies of Lincoln during his presidency?,12/26/2018 1:49
1852,992," I wonder whether he read them aloud or silently. Silent reading is a recent thing. Centuries ago, few could read silently.",9/16/2017 2:05
1852,992, That's super weird. You would get very strange looks now. Are you familiar with Starship Troopers?,1/23/1988 1:43
1853,1853, I've seen the film. I know it's based on a Heinlein novel.,4/21/1999 15:14
1853,1324, It is. It's on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches. What an odd choice. ,8/1/1985 12:20
1853,1324," It's about strategy and tactics, though I don't know how relevant it is to the modern battlefield.",3/16/2021 3:21
1853,1324, Yes it seems like it would not be. Ender's Game was also suggested reading for military organizations. ,2/12/2021 15:55
1853,1853, It's also a story involving a lot of strategy and tactics. I think the military wants to pick stuff that troops will enjoy and understand. The Art of War might be a bit heavy for the average person.,10/27/1992 9:10
1853,1853, Oh I'm positive of that. ,9/18/2002 18:04
1853,1324, Do you know much about book banning in schools?,4/12/2018 17:56
1853,1324, I know a little. I know banning those two books would cost me two of my favorite books.,9/22/1994 23:43
1853,1853, Are either of your favorite books To Kill a Mockingbird or Huckleberry Finn? Those are ones that come up often.  ,9/26/2004 13:18
1853,1853," yes, I love them both. I named my dog Scout after To Kill a Mocking bird.",4/7/1994 21:21
1854,1854," Harper Lee addressed a Virginia school board about their removal of her book, because they said it was immoral.",1/12/1995 18:53
1854,1854, She just released a new follow up to To Kill a Mockingbird.,8/31/1989 6:17
1854,410," Does it happen in the same area of the South, at the same time with the same characters?",7/2/1994 6:51
1854,410, I am not sure. I have not read it yet. Did you read those two books?,7/3/2009 20:58
1854,410, I read both Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a Mockingbird when I was in school.  My local school board didn't seem to have any problem with the N-word or other racial slurs in them.,11/15/1994 19:08
1854,1854, Mine either. I wonder if the sensitivity will cause them to miss out on other things or shelter them from other areas that make a well-rounded adult (please don't infer I am encouraging racism).,3/28/1973 20:42
1854,410, i agree with Harper Lee who stated that she didn't think that racial tension problems would be solved by banishing classics.,12/8/1991 22:27
1854,1854, Seems like she knows a lot about it. Seems reasonable to adovovate for your book.,6/12/1989 18:57
1854,410," Sometimes when books aren't banned a parent can request an alternative book, but personally it seem like you would miss out on the classroom discussions and learning if you are the only one reading it.",8/17/2001 23:43
1854,1854," Yeah. I agree. I haven't read to kill a mockingbird in a while and will need to re-read it. After all, there are more libraries in the US than McDonalds.",9/28/2015 13:46
1855,1855," And if  you don't want to read it in print form you can get it in another format, like audiobook, or you can use a device to read it as an e-book.",1/14/1989 5:29
1855,1855," How would you like to wheelbarrow 32,000 books 3/4 of a mile at age 85???",12/24/1998 12:55
1855,1855," I hope i have that much strength at age 85, or such devotion to donate them to a library like Gladstone did. ",8/20/2016 17:41
1855,1416, I know... MY 40 year old body aches when I get off the couch!,5/5/1999 19:24
1855,1416," Well, you can get some media in a digital form from the library and stay on your couch if you want.",11/5/1994 12:02
1855,1416, Nice. My life just got a little lazier... Not sure if that is a good thing...,1/5/1995 7:36
1855,1416," If you need more stuff to do but don't have the equipment you could loan things from a library, they have library of things.",3/7/2017 15:03
1855,1416, Nice... Thanks for the chat!,2/23/1986 6:10
1855,1416, Good morning! I'm going to the library today. Do you like to go to the library?,5/14/1982 5:01
1855,1416, I adore libraries. It was my very first job in high school. There is nothing like the collection of knowledge in a library. ,12/9/1988 9:41
1856,1856, Have you ever heard the story of the guy who spent so much time studying in the prison library that he became a lawyer?,10/15/2019 14:11
1856,506, I have heard of him. I wish more libraries were like sacramento where you can borrow things you need. ,7/20/1986 3:33
1856,1856, I think that's so cool that you can borrow things other than books! I'm just excited I can borrow DVD's for free!,7/19/2014 19:35
1856,506, My kids love the dvd section. I like wandering the old books part. It has a smell that is like nothing else. ,5/20/1989 4:07
1856,1856, I like older books too! My favorites are the old Mark Twain books ,3/12/2020 1:29
1856,506, Mark Twain was a great american treasure. His books still are relevent today which is amazing. ,1/22/1972 15:49
1856,506," They are such classics! He was much more successful as a writer than as a riverboat pilot, I'm sure!",6/21/1989 17:44
1856,506, Definately! I can totally see why him and tesla were friends. They were both quite the character. ,9/13/2010 11:48
1856,506, What else do you like to read? I enjoy sci-fi books as well,12/9/2007 23:43
1856,506, I love mystery novels. Which aparently caused a panic in 18th century society. ,1/11/2018 4:50
1857,71, I wonder if they thought people were going to start doing bad things because of them? Have you read Starship Troopers?,9/19/1980 2:24
1857,1857, No I haven't. I'm more novels and short stories. Although I'd be fascinated to read the bad poetry from the lewis/tolkien competition. ,7/9/2014 4:00
1857,1857, I can only imagine it is hilarious! I've heard the military encourages reading because it refines one's critical analysis. ,1/15/2010 13:43
1857,71, I love that they are assigning books to help train. So often in our modern society we default to videos. ,6/19/1980 17:19
1857,1857, SO true! Reading gives the opportunity for the reader to come up with their own interpretation rather than blindly following instruction,2/11/1978 21:47
1857,71, It is so crucial for language acquistion too. I think that is why we have a disconect in communiction now days. Not a lot of people read beyond articles anymore. ,6/14/2022 0:37
1857,71, At least we have people who donate their own time and resources to help push the idea of reading further!,6/23/2019 8:14
1857,71, The prime minister from england that donated his own collection to peopel who didn't have books warms my bibliophile heart. ,2/18/1973 1:38
1857,1857, and he was 85! and pushed them almost a mile! that's dedication,10/21/2016 16:53
1857,71, A true believer in reading I'm sure! I think the way Norway supports authors is amazing. ,3/14/1991 15:33
1858,1858, I do too! You are guaranteed to sell at least a 1000 copies!,11/22/2015 17:30
1858,764, As an author that is a huge milestone. ,11/5/2000 9:54
1858,1858, Good morning!  It's cold here and might be the perfect day to curl up in a blanket and read.,10/9/1983 1:50
1858,764, Hello there! Yeah we got a ton of snow here last night. ,11/30/2015 22:00
1858,1858, Hope you don't have to go out in it soon.  Do you like to read?,5/3/1997 15:25
1858,764," Yeah same here, except I have to work tonight.  Yeah I read a little bit, how about yourself?",4/27/1977 2:58
1858,764," Well be careful when you do.  I really do like to read, but I probably don't spend enough time doing it.  It's too bad I'm not Anne Jones who is the world record speed reader and can read like 4,700 words/minute!",6/10/2022 17:32
1858,764," Holy cow, I don't even know how one could understand that many words that quickly. ",3/9/1998 6:56
1858,1858," I do wonder how much she is able to retain, but it's still impressive.Do you normally get your books from the library?",1/21/1997 2:04
1858,1858, I haven't been to the library in a very long time no.  I guess the inventor of the brail system finished it at 15!,11/2/1997 7:05
1859,1859, What did the braille system inventor finish?,5/21/1998 22:34
1859,1143," The reading and writing system for the blind, the brail system. He invented it, and then perfected it by age 15. ",1/14/2020 22:23
1859,1859, Wow.  That is pretty impressive!  Another thing that was impressive to me that I recently found out is that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US!,4/5/1993 0:55
1859,1859," That is a really cool fact, I would never have guessed that as well. ",5/11/1976 2:39
1859,1143," It seems like I pass three McDonald's to get to one library.  Apparently, not all libraries are for books.  In Sacramento they have a library of things where people can check out sewing machines and other short-term use items.",7/12/1987 10:25
1859,1859," Wow, that is a cool idea.  I think my local library is doing a similar thing.  Did you know many libraries carry video games?",6/19/1985 4:25
1859,1859," I don't.  I knew mine carried videos and audiobooks, but didn't know about video games!",10/31/2014 3:45
1859,1859," Yeah I wonder what kinds they have, that would be awesome to rent old sega genesis games or other old consoles!",11/10/1995 15:44
1859,1859, That would be cool.  Do you have any favorite authors?,8/27/2009 7:26
1859,1859," Yeah it would be.  No, I don't really have a favorite, how about yourself?",10/11/2008 19:17
1860,1858," I'm not sure I do, but I know Mark Twain is loved by a lot of people.",5/25/1984 9:33
1860,1860," Yeah I think people really like him.  I know my grandmother was a huge fan of Harper Lee, even had a signed copy of To Kill a Mockingbird. ",9/6/1986 5:53
1860,1860," I've never read it, but I know that both that and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have been surrounded in controversy because of the use of the n-word.",3/29/2022 5:58
1860,1860," Yeah I have read that and also heard about it on the local radio stations as well.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day. ",8/28/2010 14:22
1860,1858, Hello - did you know a man was falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spent most of his time at the library to prove his innocence? ,1/31/2013 12:52
1860,1858, I was not aware of that! That is interesting! Much cheaper than having to buy a lawyer! I do know there are more libraries than there are McDonald's in the US and that's a huge plus considering libraries are much more beneficial to us than Mickey D's!,2/12/2009 3:17
1860,1860, That's crazy,1/30/2014 10:01
1860,1860, I've always enjoyed libraries. But there's a library in Sacramento that actually allows you to check out useful stuff like sewing machines for temporary use that I've wanted to check out.,1/24/2016 20:32
1860,1858, Wow that's pretty cool. ,12/17/1980 0:20
1860,1860, Libraries are certainly beneficial to those of us who love reading. Are you a fan of reading? I've been wanting to check out the book Starship Troopers as it's the first official sci-fi book on the reading lists of three of the US military branches!,6/9/2011 16:38
1861,244, Yes they are. Did you know starship troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list of the US military? ,6/19/2016 8:14
1861,244," I did and that's one of the reasons I want to read it to be honest! Of course, one day I'd like to beat Anne Jones' record reading speed of 4700 words per minute. Lol Realistically, that'll never happen with me but one can dream! Ha!",10/6/1990 23:21
1861,1861, Haha that would be cool to beat that record!,9/1/1971 21:36
1861,1861," Indeed! It would be difficult though as the reading process requires continuous practice, development as well as refinement! ",8/27/2022 2:29
1861,1861, For sure! I saw there was a moral panic in the 18th century due to the spread of reading novels. LOL,1/20/2010 9:26
1861,1861," Wow! That's hard to believe! Wonder why? I bet CS Lewis and Tolkien had a good laugh about that during their You laugh, you lose competition.",2/10/1993 3:23
1861,244, LOL yea I bet they did have a good laugh about that. ,8/23/1977 8:20
1861,1861," Speaking of humor, I always enjoyed Mark Twain's humor. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had some funny moments in it!",5/31/1997 13:59
1861,1861, Yes it did. Did you know Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain were best friends? ,6/6/1989 8:30
1861,1861, Really? That is so cool. I did not know that actually? I do know Edison filmed the only footage on record of Twain. I've always wanted to see it. Would be cool if he had footage of Tesla and Twain together!,10/28/2020 22:58
1862,1335, That would be cool. Did you know Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of Mark Twain? ,8/15/2001 2:39
1862,1862," Yeah I did know about that and it's weird, isn't it? Twain had so many funny quips and statements. He once said cherimoya was the most delicious fruit known to man. Truer words have never been spoken! Ha!",10/14/1974 9:39
1862,1862, Very weird. Interesting!,2/14/2017 9:13
1862,1862, He also coined the word gullible which is a word I enjoy using. He used it to describe Tom Sawyer's buddies who were tricked into painting a fence!,1/15/2000 10:48
1862,1335, Good talking to you!,3/1/1997 23:40
1862,1862," Hi, how are you?",8/26/1993 7:32
1862,1335," Hi! Doing great, you like listening to music?",6/5/1983 5:30
1862,1335, I do like listening to music. Do you?,1/25/1998 15:32
1862,1335," Yes, I especially enjoyed Lady Gaga's performance in the movie A Star is Born, but what I like even more is James Corden and Alicia Keys remake of the lyrics on the song Shallow on his comedy show.",11/16/1999 15:06
1862,1335, I love Lady Gaga. She seems so nice. Elton John named her his son's godmother.,8/29/1983 10:32
1863,1863," That's pretty neat, I wonder what kind of gifts or treatment being the godson of Lady Gaga gets especially when she's had so many successful singles from Poker Face to Bad Romance to Just Dance, I'm familiar with all of them!",11/25/2000 16:02
1863,486," When ever Poker Face comes on the radio, my son asks me How do you wake up Lady Gaga? Poker Face! HAHAHA! Gets me everytime!",8/17/1992 6:09
1863,1863," Lol! That's hilarious! I'll have to tell that to my son next time, he's a goofball. He told me when Frozen came out and the songs kept playing over and over again and asked me whether I knew what that song really meant and referred to and I said No and he said it's talking about a fart and encouraging people to fart. Oh boys.",6/25/2020 0:25
1863,486," Geez! My son would love that. He loves poop and fart jokes, which he may or may not have gotten from me. I am not a mature man...",1/6/1983 7:13
1863,1863," Lol, hear hear. I think it's hilarious watching my young kids talk and laugh so hard at such simple things. They also contribute to the data that from 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in America. Are you a Netflix subscriber?",4/13/2003 2:08
1863,1863, I am. Are you?,7/2/2012 4:46
1863,1863," Yes and it's a great service especially since I've also been victim of the enormous fees for returning dvds late back when Blockbuster was alive. Reed Hastings, the found of Netflix, created Netflix because of the same fact!",2/27/2020 2:55
1863,486, Blockbuster had the chance to buy Netflix for $50M and passed.,7/15/1993 2:55
1863,1863," That is a bad move, Netflix is now worth 2 billion dollars since they and youtube together make up for half of peak internet traffic in the US!",7/5/2018 1:29
1863,1863," There's only 1 blockbuster left in the us and it's in Alaska. I remember when they tried to respond to the nextflix threat, much too late and failed miserably.",1/29/1973 18:54
1864,373," There's still a Blockbuster left?! I thought they declared bankruptcy, but then so many other stores have declared bankruptcy but I still see them, like Radio Shack, K-Mart, Sears, etc.",12/15/2020 17:33
1864,1864, bankruptcy is just protection against creditors. They can still operate but a lot just close because they are too far behind. There's no coming back. Like that $40 late fee you referenced!,9/9/2013 2:22
1864,1864," Oh ok I see, and Toys R' Us too! It's crazy how a few companies have basically bankrupted these stores that were once kings in their industries!  Do you like astronomy?",7/22/1983 7:16
1864,1864," I went into a toy r us when they were closing and it was the saddest thing ever. I looked at a capitalist dismantling, literally, of my romanticized childhood.",12/16/2004 20:20
1864,1864," Exactly! I did the same thing and even then, the prices were still so much more expensive than Amazon! I tried to get toys about the solar systems but couldnt' find any.",12/9/1984 19:44
1864,373, Do you like the solar system?,2/11/2013 16:13
1864,373, Of course! Interesting to think that there are other planets like Uranus that rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spin like other planets.,9/19/1991 6:54
1864,1864, [Immature giggle] Nice chatting with you!,5/23/1981 5:18
1864,1864, Are you a fan of Netflix?,8/19/2000 11:10
1864,1864, I am a fan. It's hard to believe that it was founded back in 1997.,12/16/1994 18:06
1865,1865, I never knew that! I think they were mostly postal based during that time,1/15/1999 2:16
1865,1924," Yes, even today Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.",12/23/2008 0:34
1865,1865," wow, that is crazy.  Could be why they have like 21 billion in debt!",5/19/2000 22:27
1865,1865, Wow! That is a lot of debt. I wonder if Blockbuster is upset they didn't buy Netflix  after several offers to get it for $50 million. It is worth a lot more now!,12/11/2000 8:10
1865,1865," They are really kicking themselves now, I wonder how blockbuster is doing lol. ",10/25/2000 0:37
1865,1865," I am not sure, there are no Blockbuster stores by me anymore.",2/22/1987 9:11
1865,1924," I think there is only one that exists now, and it does good business. Did you hear how netflix started?",2/22/2015 12:51
1865,1865," No, I am not sure of how it started. Are you?",4/3/2019 1:41
1865,1865, The owner got a 40 dollar late charge from blockbuster for apollo 13 and was upset over it. Big mistake blockbuster!,3/29/2007 1:50
1865,1865, That is a big lat fee! Did you know the company expanded internationally in 2012?,11/11/2001 9:43
1866,1866," Right, I didn't know it took until 2012 to expand. I heard it still isn't in china yet, that would be a huge market!",7/15/2005 5:48
1866,1866," Yes, it might be. Half of peak internet traffic in North America is made up by Netflix and You Tube.",4/17/1985 19:40
1866,1932," wow, I am part of both of those, mostly netflix though. Did you ever see the show lilyhammer?",6/8/2005 9:52
1866,1932," No, I have never seen it. Why?",4/24/1970 4:53
1866,1866," It was Netflix's original show they created. It was pretty good, I recommend it!",2/9/2007 6:17
1866,1866, I'll have look into it! Thanks! Incredible that as of October 2018 they had 147 million worldwide subscribers.,4/10/1977 23:02
1866,1866, wow so many! It was so nice chatting with you!,4/30/1982 2:30
1866,1932, Nice chatting with you too.,3/6/1973 20:56
1866,1866, Thanks! Enjoy the rest of your day!,11/10/2012 1:34
1866,1866, Do you like to watch movies?,11/9/2012 19:50
1867,1867, I do like to watch movies.  They are generally well crafted escapist entertainment. I might be a super hero as well.,1/24/2008 2:18
1867,156," I love hero movies, do you have a favorite hero, mine is Spiderman or Peter Parker",3/22/1979 21:55
1867,156," Can I say that Robbie the robot from the original lost in space is my hero.  Always around and in the way. Danger Will robinson, Danger.",8/29/1977 0:09
1867,156," That movie was pretty good, Lost in Space, it has a great cast including Molly Parker",3/14/1975 17:26
1867,1867, Why is it you enjoy Peter Parker.  Most super heroes today are hapless everyman's who get special powers and use them for good.  Is there a wrong you need to right?,9/22/1976 14:18
1867,1867, No I only think his powers are super cool did you watch Avengers Infinity War?,7/12/2005 14:52
1867,156," I admit, I have not seen Avengers Infinity War.  I did watch the Lost in Space Remake.  It was entertaining.  But it worried me the way they bounced from ridiculous danger to imminent peril to life threatening situation. It was a bit much.",12/26/2010 17:32
1867,1867," Would you recommend Lost in Space? whats it about just wondering, seems like a good movie",12/29/1993 11:26
1867,156," The family, the robinsons, are trying to get to a new planet.  They are colonists.  Stuff goes wrong. They crash on some unknown planet.  They survive.  It is not a movie, but a show with a number of episodes.  Intense action. Danger.  If the action of super hero movie is good four you, you will like.",11/29/2013 15:18
1867,1867," Sounds interesting, anyways do you subscribe to Netflix?",1/18/1988 23:02
1868,1868, I do subscribe to Netflix.  I have made a note to look for Killing Eve  The description of the show seems vague on what actually happens.  Spy thriller or what?,12/13/1995 23:03
1868,1868," Its available in Netflix its a British series it seems, I haven seen that one before though, it looks interesting",10/5/2021 20:52
1868,1868, Dark Humor sometimes appeals Sandra Oh might be nice as well.  ,1/16/2019 4:00
1868,1868," Im not really sure I like dark humor, but I try to keep an open mind about it",5/24/1983 22:20
1868,291," It kind of funny that Lou Ferrigno, the original TV hulk still does hulk voice.  Hulk smash.  All these characters were created in the 1930's.",5/29/1994 3:00
1868,291," He does? thats really interesting, do you know Jarvis, Starks assistant?",5/29/1987 0:44
1868,291," No, Stark is Iron Man.  But Jarvis is not a character I know.",10/26/1993 22:00
1868,291," Well Jarvis is his computer assistant and the person who does the voice of Jarvis had never seen an Avengers movie, I think thats funny.",6/12/2011 1:38
1868,291," Yes, if you do the work, you should at least see the end result.  Do you like shawarma?",3/28/2003 13:07
1868,1868," I do yeah, one of my favorite foods why do you ask?",4/2/1994 17:13
1869,1869," It is documented that shawarma sales go up because of avengers movies.  I like shawarma, but never thought to link the two.",9/10/2012 12:15
1869,1869," I guess its because of the ending scene, heroes gather at end at a Shawarma place, in fact im getting a but hungry not a bad idea, thanks for the chat I think im going to eat a Shawarma now,",12/26/1988 5:33
1869,1869," I would not have known that unless I watched the movie, or had you to explain. Thanks.",5/10/2012 7:52
1869,597," Thank to you, I feel I have learn a lot of interesting facts, have a nice day, bye",9/1/1994 7:13
1869,1869, I am a big fan of the Marvel comics! The Avengers is really great.,12/31/1991 8:13
1869,1869," ya I agree, did you hear that due to the avengers there was an increase in shawarma sales haha!",9/8/2005 21:44
1869,1869," Oh awesome! Ha. It was shot with an imax camera, the entire movie! That's just one reason it was spectacular. Imax theater movies are amazing but sometimes make me dizzy.",5/12/1986 3:36
1869,1869," ya sometimes it is too overwhelming, did you ever watch the show recess? the girl who voices gretchen voiced the waitress in the Avengers",4/29/2010 3:14
1869,1869," Yes, I loved Recess! I didn't know that, how cool! The Avengers- The Age of Ultron was the nineteenth film. ",2/1/2010 13:03
1869,1869," ah interesting, did you watch the original incredible hulk from the 70s btw?",12/3/2002 6:00
1870,1870," Heck yeah, I was a big fan of the Hulk. I watched the show religiously every week! My cousin was related to the guy who played him but I cant remember his name.",8/24/2021 16:54
1870,1870," haha ya his name was Lou Ferrigno, and he actually appeared in one of the avengers movies!",6/16/1987 5:48
1870,1870," Oh yeah, I sort of remember that. How cool! I am into reading the Marvel comics too and really enjoy all the characters and the themes. In 1998 marvel offered the rights to sony for all the characters for $25 million but they only wanted Spiderman for $10 million because they claimed thats the only one people would care about.",3/31/1993 20:07
1870,1371, haha that's funny! did you know the guy who plays jarvis's voice? I guess he has never watched an avengers movie haha,1/16/1985 5:30
1870,1870," Noway, what a trip! How would you someone not watch their own work? I am big on watching them with Netflix. Netflix is fast and has super bandwidth.",1/20/2003 20:58
1870,1870," oh definitely, didyou hear about how Netflix was started? like what inspired its creation?",9/2/1993 10:20
1870,1371," No, I am not sure how they started. I do know I am one of 137 million total subscribers now.I can remember when they first started and we would order and mail the dvd's back and forth through the mail.",9/7/2022 8:16
1870,1870," haha ya I remember that, it makes sense they  switched to digital, I guess Netflix spends 20x more on postage than on the streaming bandwidth",12/8/2020 4:36
1870,1371," Man, thats a lot. I heard that the only places that don't have Netflix is North Korea, Syria and Crimea. That sounds about right when you think of North Korea and how oppressed they are.",12/31/2012 21:24
1870,1371," ya, that would make sense, anyway the funny story on how netflix was started is the creator was charged a $40 late fee for Apollo 13, that is a good movie though!",2/23/1998 9:50
1871,1221," Oh wow, that is a funny story. I guess everyone in the world gets late fees, not just me! lol.",12/22/1998 21:23
1871,1871," haha yes I haven't gotten a $40 late fee though, do you like Marvel or DC more btw?",1/25/1999 21:16
1871,1871," Oh man that is a hard question to answer. I don't think I can choose today. I like the characters that was created for kids with poor hearing though, I like the social aspect of Marvel Worldwide inc.",8/18/2009 15:38
1871,1221," ya that is true, I like batman but besides him I only like Marvel, funny that there is one character shared by both Marvel and DC",5/20/2008 7:19
1871,1221," Oh cool, okay I really like Batman and Robin too. I never forget about the sidekick. Walt Disney acquired Marvel and he branding has just become a 2 billion dollar venture.",12/16/1985 13:00
1871,1221," ya I remember that, it was back in 2009, seems like a while ago but it has definitely paid off!",4/23/1999 15:44
1871,1221, hi how are you? do you use netflix?,5/20/1994 7:16
1871,1221," I do, what about you? ",9/1/1995 15:25
1871,1221, I used to watch. i dont know. i cut the cord. LOL,12/31/2007 8:15
1871,1221," Interesting. I was thinking about it, but I still use it sometimes. ",3/17/1983 2:56
1872,1872, I used to watch quite a bit and realized i needed to use my time better.,11/24/1974 17:20
1872,1872, That is a good point. What if you could be a paid tagger though? ,5/30/1995 6:20
1872,1920," I guess that job seems cool, but after a while, you get tired of watching tv and tagging. i would get bored.",9/15/2011 0:00
1872,1872," Yeah, I hear you. Did you know netflix monitors illegal downloads in Europe? ",10/7/2002 16:07
1872,1872, I guess they want to see what people want to watch. netflix can plan then.,11/18/1993 1:40
1872,1920, Do you like Marvel Comics?,6/4/1971 23:01
1872,1872, i dont read comics much. I sometimes see the movies though. not often.,2/28/2009 1:11
1872,1872, I see some of the movies too. I think some of them really can suck though too. ,7/20/2005 1:39
1872,1872," yeah, too many explosions and too many battles. i tire of the spectacle. i prefer story",11/14/2015 0:24
1872,1920," Me too, that is why I am more of a fan of thrillers. What about you? ",8/5/2004 2:47
1873,1873," I prefer dramas and comedies. I figure that superhero films can be good, just too many are geared to kids.",9/12/2019 9:49
1873,34," I like dramas. Comedies, only on rare occasions. ",10/25/2010 11:21
1873,1873," comedy is tough, and many bad comedies are made. i like superhero films that are comedies though.",11/26/1972 3:03
1873,1873, So did you like Deadpool? ,10/6/2010 13:44
1873,34," I did like Deadpool. only saw the first one, but i like that humor. less superhero stuff, more story and dialog. anyway, great chat!",4/14/2020 18:59
1873,34, I only saw the first one too. Nice chatting with you!,5/31/1998 5:08
1873,34, You too! Have a great weekend!,2/1/2012 20:09
1873,1873, Take it easy!,1/23/2012 8:11
1873,1873, Hello. Do you know a lot about Marvel?,2/27/1996 17:35
1873,1873, Yes I think so. I love the movie infinity War. It was the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital IMAX cameras.,4/12/1970 19:20
1874,695, You can really tell. I love the attention ot detail they are putting into these movies. They are really diving into some great comics with all of this. ,10/28/2005 20:33
1874,695, Yes I totally agree. For example they included the original Hulk actor in several appearances of the movies!,9/4/1989 23:15
1874,1874, I like Lou Ferrigno. He is totally iconic Hulk. I think they did an awesome job with all the cast really. I'm honestly trying to think of a better actor for Jarvis than Paul Bettany and I can't. ,11/3/1978 5:10
1874,1874, Yes I totally agree. Isn't it surprising that he has never seen the films?,7/29/1981 22:31
1874,1874, I could see it though because if he wants to portray the character in a certain way watching an edited version might change that subtly and affect the quality of his work,5/21/1992 22:55
1874,695, Yes I guess that's a very good point. Do you know why the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales?,2/13/2004 6:22
1874,1874, That is hilarious. I could totally see that too. There are so many funny memes about how the avengers are sitting in that schwarma restaurant and the workers are going about things like nothing happened. ,12/17/1977 4:01
1874,1874, Oh I see that explains it! Yes that was hilarious. I love having The Avengers on Netflix so I can watch at anytime. From 9pm to 12am Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America!,3/26/2015 8:53
1874,1874, Wow that is a lot of streaming movies! Their original content is quite good too. I like what they have done with some of the marvel characters in their own series. ,12/24/2014 15:51
1874,1874, Agreed. I wonder how they got the rights to make those films? Netflix apparently spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,5/23/2017 16:28
1875,438, I guess that makes sense. Postage is spendy. Late fees are too though which is how the whole idea of Netflix started. Some guy got a late fee and wasn't having that. ,2/28/2017 15:33
1875,1875, Yeah definitely is. I used to hate late fees. So glad Reed Hastings found a way around them!,4/17/2012 0:45
1875,1875, Me too! I can't believe how big Netflix has gotten. I bet blockbuster is kicking themselves they didn't take that deal to buy them for $50 million back in the day. ,2/10/1973 12:54
1875,438, Yes can you imagine a blockbuster bought them at that time? Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,4/26/2004 4:26
1875,1875, I'm pretty sure blockbuster would still be around if that had happened. I'm glad that Hastings was smart and dropped the failing sales idea though. It would have been a shame if Netflix had went under because of it. ,12/20/1985 1:43
1875,438, Yes I completely agree with you. And now look at them go. Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide.,2/22/2006 12:23
1875,1875, I was shocked to read that only about half of those were in the US. I would have totally though it was more considering it is a quarter of the internet traffic in north america. ,1/15/1983 21:12
1875,438," That really is amazing. But you're right they do have offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea. A global market no doubt. It was great chatting with you today.",8/13/1992 23:14
1875,1875, You as well. Have a great day!,12/26/1991 17:17
1875,438, Have you ever seen the movie Cloverfield? ,8/14/1976 14:20
1876,168, I have seen the movie Cloverfield which one is your favorite?,5/1/2016 19:59
1876,168," I liked the first one. I didn't know they had a series, is that available now? ",6/2/1995 15:29
1876,1876, Yes there are a series of these movies. My favorite is 10 Cloverfield Lane. It has John Goodman and is really good,10/8/1994 19:48
1876,168," Yeah, I saw that one. Is there a 3rd? I was completely unaware!",10/4/2022 9:12
1876,168, Yes that is the third one. It's very different though because it does not have a big monster in it. I don't want to give away the ending but it is pretty crazy,9/15/1970 17:44
1876,1876, Interesting. I will check it out this weekend. I didn't think the second one was as good as the first to be honest. ,8/30/1995 18:35
1876,168, I didn't see the second one actually but I would definitely recommend that you watch the third one it is really good,11/20/1987 4:44
1876,1876," Ok, the 2nd one they are trapped in one room the whole movie (it isn't that great). ",2/26/1979 23:03
1876,168, Ok haha. Do you have Netflix by the way?,11/14/1985 17:42
1876,168," No, I canceled my sub a while back. Did you know that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america? ",4/29/2003 4:24
1877,1877, Wow that is crazy. Also Netflix alone can take up about a third of all bandwidth in North America.,4/15/1982 5:34
1877,1877," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. Have you heard of the theory of only one electron in the universe? ",10/22/1998 14:34
1877,1041, I have heard of that. I also heard of the one giant hologram Theory I think that Elon Musk believes in that,10/12/1971 10:11
1877,1877, Interesting. Did you know there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand? ,11/13/2010 13:26
1877,1877, Wow that is cool. Did you know that stars planets and gas clouds form about 6% of all matter?,12/20/2008 7:04
1877,1041, I can believe that. Have you heard of the natural selection theory of universes? ,6/20/2002 0:06
1877,1041, No I haven't. Can you tell me more about it?,5/29/2020 7:05
1877,1877," Scientists theorize that universes evolve naturally, pretty crazy. ",1/21/1971 12:11
1877,1041, Science is getting very fantastic these days! What about Netflix do you have a Netflix account?,5/4/1988 12:33
1877,1041," I don't, I canceled it after I got hit with a LATE FEE! LOL",10/25/1974 7:40
1878,1878," Hi, how are you today?",4/27/2005 6:54
1878,8, hey I'm good what do you know about basketball?,11/9/1991 3:51
1878,8, I sometimes follow NBA ball. What about you?,8/31/1993 20:46
1878,8," ya I like it, its made up of 30 teams and only 1 team is in canada",3/5/2000 11:35
1878,8, Hockey and lacrosse are the official sports of Canada. There should be NBA teams in other big cities in Canada though.,8/24/1976 11:47
1878,8," ya you'd think so, It's only the Toronto Raptors apparently",8/20/1983 2:18
1878,1878," How many players these days would shoot free throws granny style, do you think?",5/27/1989 18:43
1878,1878," probably none, but I would! It's scientifically the best way to shoot!",12/30/2010 3:40
1878,1878," It would look silly, but Rick Barry used to shoot like that. If you had to choose, would you go to college or directly into the NBA?",6/8/1986 7:43
1878,1878," oh I'd go right to the NBA, I wouldn't do what tim duncan did and stay in college, you?",9/5/1978 15:56
1879,1684," Too much money at stake, and people can go to college at any age. You can always get a degree, but NBA players are young.",7/27/1997 18:33
1879,1879," yup I agree, did you ever try on some air jordans?",1/30/1980 18:50
1879,1879," No, never tried them. Stylish but expensive.",11/27/1980 1:15
1879,1684, ya I guess they were banned from the NBA but Nike kept paying the fee,3/4/2011 17:36
1879,1879," The fines would have been trivial for Nike, far less than the value of the publicity. ",2/15/2020 10:57
1879,1684," ya for sure, did you ever play chess?",6/18/1991 4:49
1879,1684, Played a little many years ago. Not really my game. You?,7/17/2013 12:20
1879,1684," I used to be really good, its crazy it was invented in India and then perfected in Persia, its very old",5/12/1977 8:14
1879,1684," It's a cerebral game with fans all over the world. Well, I enjoyed chatting!",4/30/2011 7:30
1879,1684, thanks you should check out books by judit polgar she's great at chess!,1/27/2013 23:36
1880,1880, Will do. Ciao!,11/23/2001 13:26
1880,1880, yup and just know there are more moves in chess than atoms in the galaxy!,1/23/2003 19:53
1880,610," Parenting can be really hard, it requires a lot of hard work and patience.",6/21/2012 2:55
1880,610," Hi, how are you? I wouldn't want to be a solo parent. It sounds like a tough job to balance career and child-care.",9/7/1982 1:34
1880,1880," I know! it seems like a lot of suffering, kids can be difficult specially if you have more than one",2/19/2019 5:52
1880,610, It's important for kids to have good toys. Did you play with Lego as a child?,12/3/2001 2:06
1880,1880," I did, I used to love legos, what about you?",10/13/1988 13:18
1880,1880," I did, and I loved them. I like the company, too. Lego is investing millions to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternative",5/1/1981 16:11
1880,1880," I think thats a great call, afterall they have the money and its better if they are environmentally responsible, Lego sure is a big and wealthy company.",10/24/1990 4:31
1880,1880," In February 2015, Lego replaced Ferrari as Brand Finance's world's most powerful brand. They've earned it! ",2/15/1997 15:48
1881,1881, I think this is because of the quality of their pieces out of 1000000 only 18 turn out to be deffective.,2/22/2017 6:37
1881,1881," Customers pay a premium for quality. The company recognizes employee dedication. A 14 karat gold lego brick was given out in the early 80s to employees who had worked at the germany lego factory for over twenty-five years. they are valued at nearly $15,000.",5/29/1985 23:34
1881,27," I see, that is really expensive I wouldnt pay that much for a lego brick, did you hear about that German Graffiti artist.",4/18/1993 11:40
1881,27," Oh, the guy who painted a 250 square meter bridge to make it look like it was made out of lego? Yeah, that's cool. A world of Lego! Could paint a whole neighborhood like that.",11/24/2012 2:54
1881,27," I wonder if the bridge is still painted, that is pure art, I know I would keep it there. ",12/19/1985 18:40
1881,27, It would attract tourists and Lego fans. I assume there are many around the world. If all the Lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would own 86 Lego bricks.,1/8/1997 22:09
1881,1881," I would like to take a photo next to that bridge, and that is amazing, there must be billions of lego bricks then, do you like reading?",4/15/1995 23:12
1881,1881," Yes, I enjoy reading. I don't get to the library much now though.",10/29/1988 6:07
1881,27, Not enough time? there more libraries than McDonalds!,7/22/2012 13:27
1881,1881, Mostly I go online for reading material. There are other things at libraries though. The Sacramento public library started a library of things ,8/24/2021 0:09
1882,1882," I wonder what the Sacremento library means but things, seems kind of random. ",4/13/2006 8:48
1882,1882," Things like sewing machines and other items that patrons may find useful, but don't need to own long-term. Lending tools instead of books.",3/23/1994 16:44
1882,821," I see well, I like old books from CS Lewis and Tolkien, I consider both as great authors.",5/19/2017 6:36
1882,821, Do you spend much time reading?,6/29/1980 14:12
1882,821," Yes I love to reading,  although lately ive been doing audio books because I have been busy. How about you?",1/19/2009 15:30
1882,821, I adore reading. I think it is best way to travel to unknown worlds and escape reality for a little while. ,5/26/1992 1:45
1882,821, Yeah its great really expands your mind.  Did you know the world reacord speed reader reads at 4700 words per min,2/12/1973 9:12
1882,821, wow. I wonder if they actually retain anything at that point. Are you just flying past the words or do you absorb the story?,2/19/1997 17:06
1882,1882," I have no clue,  I cant imagine they preocess everything they read at that point,  but I am not an expert. ",2/18/2008 5:33
1882,1882, I would rather take my time and savor the classics like the works of lewis and tolkien. ,12/22/2003 17:12
1883,1883," I wouldnt mind being able to read fast,  but I still want to absorb the information,  otherwise what is the point lol ",7/12/1980 3:42
1883,1883, Yeah I mean yay you can ready fast but you are missing out on all the wonders that the library holds. ,4/17/2008 5:59
1883,314, Yeah exactly.  In the 18th century there was a moral panic because people were reading so many novel hahahahah,12/9/1993 0:51
1883,314, Wow i wonder what they would do if they read some of the things we have now like 50 shades of gray and twilight. ,6/25/2008 20:45
1883,314," Thats funny.  Twilight is a way better book in your imagination,  the movies were pretty horrible. ",8/8/1976 21:04
1883,314, I've never read the books. I saw the movies and that just ruined it for me. I heard the writing was rather bad in them though. ,9/12/1997 10:19
1883,314," It was simple,  nothing unique,  but I enjoyed it.  I wish I never seen the movies though.  Did you know if you publish a book in Norway the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries?  ",8/18/2012 2:06
1883,1883, That is pretty awesome. I think it is a great way to encourage budding writers. it is so hard to bet a book published in the us. ,1/22/1977 17:33
1883,314," Theres are more libraries than mc donalds in the US,  thats suprising,  mc donalds is everywhere lol ",9/30/1984 15:56
1883,314, That makes me happy. I think a lot of people in the world could use more libraries and more knowledge in their lives. ,4/20/1991 11:34
1884,995, Same.  I also read over half of adults have library cards!,1/18/1994 21:55
1884,995, I would think it would be higher than that. I don't think there is enough access to libraries for the people in certain areas of the us. ,4/7/1979 6:15
1884,995, Yeah thats true.  ,11/21/1988 13:40
1884,995, It is so cool how some libraries are letting people check out other things than books. Like in sacramento where they can get sewing machines or tools. ,5/29/2005 1:25
1884,1884, did you know that Spider-man has a hyphen in the name so that he wouldn't be confused with Superman by people that were reading quickly,9/15/1994 23:16
1884,1884," I didn't know that, crazy!",9/23/1988 23:41
1884,995," ya that is wild, also Stan Lee's wife did voice acting for the 1994 Spider-man cartoon, I watched that as a kid, did you?",8/28/2009 5:13
1884,995," I did actually, I thought the best spider man was Toby though. Not sure about this reboot. ",10/12/1978 10:46
1884,995," haha ya I didn't mind him, definitely better than the guy from The Social Network, I haven't seen the new movies, but it is wild to think that Capn Crunch's arch nemesis has battled Spiderman, now that is something I want to see in a movie haha",6/4/2022 2:19
1884,995, Is that who the new one is? Ughhh. Too many reboots these days. ,1/5/2008 17:42
1885,1885," Ya hollywood keeps making reboots I suppose because they are a safer investment than a new franchise, did you hear of the SpiderMan broadway musical? I never saw it but it was the most expensive broadway production in history",4/22/2010 11:58
1885,1885, I liked the batman reboots. I actually saw the musical when I lived in NY for spiderman. ,4/4/1982 3:39
1885,984, oh nice how was it? I wanted to see it but I think they stopped it at this point? I think they cancelled it soon after that one guy got injured and insurance was sued,1/23/2018 16:09
1885,1885," It was great, my work actually gave us the tickets before it got canceled. ",4/28/1971 1:40
1885,984," well that's nice, do you play chess at all? I guess they did a study and there is no correlation between chess skill and iq level",10/15/2012 7:31
1885,1885, I believe it. I'm not so sure the IQ tests are accurate to be honest. ,3/29/2017 16:10
1885,1885," Ya I'm not sure I haven't taken one, but the president of the world chess Federation thinks that chess was invented by aliens, I don't know how high of an iq that guy could have if he believes that haha",12/26/1973 18:23
1885,984," I haven't played much Chess to be honest, that sounds crazy that he believes that though. ",10/23/2009 10:01
1885,1885," ya I used to study it a little bit back in the day, what is crazy is there are more possible chess moves than there are atoms in the universe, that's a lot of permutations!",1/27/2022 8:37
1885,1885, really? I suppose that may be possible. ,1/22/1997 1:21
1886,1886," what do you think of Judith Polgar? I remember I bought her chess book, anyway she beat a family friend at chess when she was only 5",5/3/1997 22:58
1886,1740," That's insane, and apparently Chess was invented in india. ",11/4/1998 20:41
1886,1886," hmm I didn't know that, I did know it was modified by the Persians, my one friend is persian and he would always say that haha",7/25/2015 2:48
1886,1740, I wonder if they hold special championships there because of that? ,5/5/1984 18:11
1886,1886," Oh I bet they do, he was very Pro-Persian so it wouldn't surprise me, all persians I have met have been very proud of their heritage",11/13/1993 23:22
1886,1740," Interesting, I've never been to India, I bet it is pretty cool. ",2/1/2011 10:00
1886,1886," Ya I haven't either, I should go someday and play chess with those people!",9/16/1974 12:04
1886,1886, Hi there! Are you a fan of Netflix?,12/5/1981 20:29
1886,1886, Not so much. I understand it has 137 million subscribers worldwide.,11/24/1984 12:53
1886,1740," That's true, and almost 60 million of those are in the US. Hard to believe it's been around since '97, back in the Blockbuster days.",7/6/1980 13:24
1887,1887, Ha. I bet Blockbuster regrets buying Netflix. Now worth 2 billion dollars.,8/20/2015 18:14
1887,1887, I know! They declined several offers of only $50 million. That pales in comparison is it's current Net Worth.,12/17/1976 18:53
1887,1887," Oops. So sorry, but you noticed that my keyboard did not include the word not as in not buying Netflix. Sometimes my typing is lacking. Anyway, I remember going to Blockbuster for videos and DVD's. What an opportunity for Hastings and Randolph to jump on the enterprise.",11/29/2002 7:42
1887,1887," Apparently, Hastings got the idea of starting Netflix after racking up a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.",5/31/1985 4:29
1887,56," Can you imagine? I'm not surprised that it is not available in China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea. I believe China won't allow the use of Google in the country. They are very closed to outside.",3/29/2008 20:46
1887,1887," I suppose that makes sense considering the types of government in those areas, plus, Netflix still has offices in Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.",6/5/2016 9:34
1887,1887, I guess if possible it could be in outerspace. Ha. There is a vey large universe to expose to Netflix. Ha.,12/28/1978 19:10
1887,1887," Haha, and isn't the Universe potentially just one giant hologram, man?",10/9/2004 2:22
1887,1887," Wow. I never thought of that possibility. I wonder who would have created that??? Hummmm? Man use to believe the earth was the center of the universe, but after scientific research, it was discovered that the sun is probably the center.",6/15/2011 1:20
1887,56," Haha, well, the sun is center of our solar system, not the Universe. The universe makes up a LOT of things.",11/26/1973 1:55
1888,977," Oh, right. Thanks for correcting that. Don't know what my keyboard was thinking. I need a robot to do my typing.",6/21/2000 9:20
1888,1888," Yeah, robots are capable of carrying out many complex actions.",8/25/2022 2:54
1888,1888, Can you imagine Michael Jackson wanted to build a moon walking robot that was 50-feet tall?,12/26/1975 13:41
1888,977, No more difficult to imagine than the robot which knows how to debone a chicken! Haha,6/8/2007 11:12
1888,1888, Crazy. Isn't it. Do you think someone will really create a human form robot?,12/15/2005 20:48
1888,1888," I mean, robots can now be controlled by rat brains, so I don't see why not?",11/16/2013 10:47
1888,1888, A bit scary. Don't you think? It's good if they can be used by the military. It's always interesting to see the police use robots to enter possible bomb sites.,4/9/2003 9:50
1888,977," Yeah, it's a double-edged sword, for sure. They've saved millions of lives, I'm sure! Anyway, it's been nice chatting with you. Enjoy your day!",2/20/1971 5:15
1888,977, Do you like to dance,3/13/2019 7:08
1888,1888," Yes, I do you. Do you?",6/12/2020 4:50
1889,1709, Only after a few drinks. I turn into a real michael jackson dancer lol,2/19/1991 16:47
1889,1709, LOL I wonder if that is how Bruce Lee won the cha-cha championship in 1958?,4/26/2003 3:10
1889,1709, I think so too! lol. I have a baby and she dances better than I can!,1/31/1998 7:31
1889,1889, Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Does yours?,12/24/1998 9:51
1889,1709," she does so much, I just got a funny video last night of her doing it!",3/11/1992 21:33
1889,1709, I'm sure you make lots of videos of her. The time goes by fast.,10/2/2017 23:07
1889,1709," I do lol, so fast! Do you own fish at all or like to eat them?",3/5/1977 20:30
1889,1709, I built a pond in my backyard. The birds seem to eat fish more than I do.,3/23/1972 21:15
1889,1889," lol that is awesome and makes sense. Put a jelly fish there, one breed is immortal",8/4/2010 12:22
1889,1889, I would be afraid of jelly fish in my pond.,10/20/1999 2:55
1890,859," right me too, lol. Even black swallower fish, they can eat other fish that are much bigger, probably birds too",4/9/2020 15:04
1890,1890, I definitely won't have them in my pond.  LOL,6/24/1979 18:12
1890,859," That is a good idea lol. Put seahorses in there though, those are always fun. They are the only fish with a neck",5/1/1971 19:55
1890,1890, I love seahorses.They would be hard to see in my pond. I do have a water tower but I'm not sure if they would go in there.,11/20/1978 10:13
1890,859," I don't think so either. Speaking back to dancing, did you know tupac was a ballet dancer at one point?",12/10/2004 18:01
1890,1890, I've read that...he was also in the Nutcracker.,10/23/1999 7:35
1890,859," That would be interesting to see, I may youtube it! It was so nice chatting with you!",7/12/1971 12:10
1890,1890, It's been nice chatting with you. I'm sure it would be fun to watch.,2/15/2020 16:51
1890,859, For sure! Enjoy your weekend!,3/18/1996 0:04
1890,859, Hi do you shop online?,12/4/1975 19:55
1891,403," Most of the time now, my favorite shop is amazon, and you?",5/23/2004 0:49
1891,1891," Me too, it is so awesome. Do you ever shop the AMazonBasics line?",6/20/1974 11:36
1891,403, Yes they say the quality is not that great but I find them to be quite good,6/9/1996 2:08
1891,1891, Yeah me too. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain,3/5/1978 18:20
1891,1891, Oh neat. They also created a new font just for kindle and similar devices called bookerly.,7/25/1984 23:22
1891,1891, Neat. Yeah Jeff built it and it is supposed to run for a 10 000 years.,3/4/1981 23:28
1891,403, WOw that is too long. They also hold the patent on the 1-click buying,6/18/1988 22:16
1891,403, Wow they have done everything. Do you know how much the first customer spent?,1/12/2022 17:11
1891,1891, I do not know that but I know that because of the patent Apple has to pay amazon to use the 1-click buying,10/6/2004 12:20
1891,403, Nice. The first customer got a building named after him after he spent less than $30,10/31/2010 6:19
1892,1892, WOw nice. They also have a website where they sell the returned stuff discounted,1/18/1988 15:33
1892,1892," Nice, that is a sweet deal. They deliver on Sundays too now because of a deal with USPS",5/17/2001 10:44
1892,103, THat is so convenient Do you know what the arrow in their logo represents?,1/25/2020 10:21
1892,103," Oh I do not know that actually, what is it there for?",10/27/1976 8:55
1892,1892, Well it means that they offer everything from a to z,9/21/1985 2:24
1892,1892, That makes sense. Their warehouse workers walk up to 15 miles,10/15/1983 10:53
1892,103, That is a lot. BestBuy and Target price match with Amazon,5/25/1987 11:31
1892,103, That is a sweet deal. ANd Amazon also owns IMDB since 1998,1/22/1982 8:48
1892,103, THey are everywhere really. DO you like robots?,8/10/1976 9:07
1892,103," I sure do, they are becoming part of our lives",1/1/1984 14:21
1893,119," Hello, do you like the Avengers?",1/25/2020 0:12
1893,119, My son likes it more than I do.  I like movies produced by Marvel Studios.,1/11/1986 14:53
1893,1893, That's cool. Did you know that Marvel goes by Marvel Cinematic Universe too?,1/29/1999 4:48
1893,119," No, I did not.  Now I do.",4/24/1999 15:02
1893,1893, Yep and the actor who voices jarvis has never seen the movies!,1/18/2015 23:18
1893,1893," Really?  That was odd.  Apparently, Avengers:  Infinity War is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.",2/10/1985 15:28
1893,1893, That's cool and that the original Incredible Hulk actor has been the voice of the Hulk up to this day since the 70's!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,7/5/1970 11:18
1893,119," I like the Hulk. Lou Ferrigno deserves it.  When I am angry at work, I want to become the green giant.",9/14/1974 22:36
1893,1893," Yeah hahaha oh wow, did you know that the Seahorse is the only fish to have  aneck?",8/12/1988 1:05
1893,119," I heard about it.  Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.",1/22/1983 0:05
1894,1894, I dont doubt it i dont think they have a heart so...,4/14/2001 14:14
1894,1894, I'm confused.  Who have no heart?,12/15/1985 6:12
1894,1894, The Jellyfish,3/22/1998 20:14
1894,1894, I wonder if scientists have studied their genes.  Some people want to be immortal.,4/21/2017 5:58
1894,371," Well, i think the best bet for that will be to look at the zebrafish more closely!",1/8/1982 20:29
1894,371, Please tell me about the zebrafish.,3/6/1996 9:09
1894,371, Well they 84 percent of the counterparts for human diseases,6/24/1995 20:09
1894,371, I see.  I'm amazed though.   We are so different from the zebrafish.,12/8/2002 21:43
1894,371, Thats why alot of secrets lie in the genes,7/18/2018 6:21
1894,1894," Apparently, the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight.  That is odd.  I do not want to be near that fish. ",5/28/2015 20:47
1895,1121, Maybe thats how it got its name haha,8/1/2002 18:31
1895,1895," There are so many interesting facts about fish.  I wish I could chat longer.  However, it is getting late.  I would like to say good night and it was truly nice chatting with you.",6/1/1990 12:10
1895,1121, Hey how are you? Do you like shopping on Amazon?,2/27/1991 14:11
1895,1121, I do.  I find that it has a lot of what I need and a lot of variety as well,3/27/1983 19:36
1895,1121," I agree, you can find all kinds of stuff on there. It's the largest internet retailer in the world!",12/30/2001 15:07
1895,1895, And it will only get bigger.  It has thousands of items from every category one can think of,2/21/2018 23:27
1895,1121," Yep, did you know that Jeff Bezos actually built a clock into a mountain?",12/16/1989 22:24
1895,1895, Sounds like he is using that Amazon stock money to good use then.  I can imagine how big his house might be,3/4/2015 1:23
1895,1121," The clock should run for 10,000 apparently. I bet his house is huge!",9/11/1986 22:07
1895,1895, Not as big as an Amazon warehouse though.  Workers walk 7-15 miles a day during their shift,11/3/1992 0:31
1896,362, That's alot of walking there! I thought my 4 miles per shift was alot.,5/10/1987 7:46
1896,1896, I figured Amazon a lot of robot helpers in the warehouse to take some of the heavy load.  Since robots are becoming more and more useful in work life,4/16/1986 6:28
1896,1896," I think they're starting to incorporate them, but there is some things that humans just do better. Did you know that the first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him?",10/23/1998 4:41
1896,1896," Wow, and I have spent thousands over the years and all I get is free shipping!",8/26/2021 3:51
1896,362," I agree, I guess we just weren't early enough. ",2/23/1982 0:26
1896,1896, I did not know originally that AMazon owns IMDB.  No wonder their movies do well with Critics,3/22/2006 3:58
1896,362, I didn't know that either. I like Amazon Prime video though.,5/16/1989 22:50
1896,362, They do have some good TV and movies on their service.  I suppose one could buy only from Amazon for everything and probably be ok.,3/13/2019 21:40
1896,362," Probably so, between them and Wal-Mart I'm set. ",1/16/2006 3:32
1896,362," I shop at walmart too, but it is always so busy.  The great thing about amazon is it just shows up at my house.  Even on Sundays",4/23/1972 20:59
1897,1897," I love getting my Amazon packages on Sundays. I started doing the grocery pickup at Wal-Mart, and I'll do instore pickups so I don't have to really go inside or deal with the registers.",10/5/2002 17:07
1897,1897, That makes sense.  And of course you can still get things shipped from walmart to your home.,5/24/2020 12:19
1897,1593," Yep, I believe they're trying to keep up with Amazon. Well I hope you have a great day. It was nice chatting with you. ",3/27/2014 3:09
1897,1897," Hai,Have you purchased on the amazon?",12/14/2021 10:22
1897,1593, I have purchased on the amazon. Have you?,5/17/2007 1:32
1897,1593," yes,Do you think the service will be useful for you on the website",6/26/1994 5:20
1897,1897, It has been reaaly helpful in buying hard to find items or everyday items I do not want to go out and buy. Do you enjoy the amazon?,6/19/2005 7:39
1897,1897," yes i like very much,Buying things as it is at home is useful",3/11/2007 11:04
1897,1593, What's been your best purchase?,9/14/2005 2:19
1897,1593, mobile phone and LED TV.,7/27/1990 20:21
1898,380," Nice. Did you buy a clock you could build into a mountain that could last for 10,000 years?",4/20/1978 2:20
1898,1898, sorry I'm not sure do you can,3/9/1978 6:09
1898,380," Oh, Jeff Bezos bought one so I thought they were available on Amazon. I wonder how big it is.",9/17/2008 10:42
1898,380," okay,What do you think about the robot?",1/18/1992 3:12
1898,1898," I like robots. Do you think they will take over the world though? I am worried about it, a lot!",12/22/2002 9:08
1898,380," Of course, I have that sadness but do you think it's possible",3/2/1976 12:44

1898,380," yes definitely,do you like horror film?",4/8/1994 15:05

1899,1899, That's pretty crazy.  Netflix apparently really has a thing for Cloverfield doesn't it?,1/1/2004 12:11
1899,1899, Netflix is pretty successful. I saw that them and YouTube make up about half of the peak internet traffic in North America.,3/11/2008 17:01
1899,352, I'd like to see more robot movies. Maybe Netflix can work on that. I think they could explore Megatron's background more.,10/13/1972 2:18
1900,1900, I saw that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.,4/29/2004 12:55
1900,1900, Yeah I guess they still send out DVDs. That's a lot of postage.,6/23/2006 17:18
1900,1616, That's a lot of postage!,5/21/1998 17:08
1900,1616, Netflix has over 150 movies with 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I wonder how many of those I've seen?,7/6/2000 5:08
1900,1616, Wow that's crazy,11/13/1976 0:15
1900,1616, I jumped on the Netflix streaming bandwagon in 2007 when they started. How about you?,8/28/2018 15:42
1900,1616, I just recently got Netflix because it was bundled in my with T Mobile account. I watch it periodically.,12/20/2005 9:49
1900,1900, I think a fun job would be one of the people that watches Netflix movies and shows and tags them for subjects and indexing. Paid to binge watch!,3/20/2003 16:34
1900,1616, That would be a very fun job. Wonder how much it pays? Netflix is worth $2 billion now.,1/31/2014 12:45
1900,1616, And 58 million subscribers in the US alone. That's like 1/6th the population.,10/5/1992 9:12
1901,1901, yea that's a lot!,6/16/1972 17:34
1901,1901, They're pretty smart too. They monitor illegal downloads to get a feel for what shows to stream.,8/29/1973 0:41
1901,1901, Yep I've heard that they do that too. ,4/23/1991 17:34
1901,1901, I'd like them to adapt some Isaac Asimov. He invented the word robotics actually.,2/24/2006 7:23
1901,229, It was great talking to you!,3/22/1972 1:00
1901,229," do you like horror films? I guess Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie, I never would have guessed that!",6/10/2011 15:17
1901,1901," Hello there, really? I wonder why he would have ever said that.  ",11/26/1983 3:21
1901,1901," ya, have you seen it? Like it's sad but not a horror movie to me, more like a sad one though haha",10/28/1975 13:39
1901,1901, I think I have but when I was really young.  Do you know how they make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies?,4/3/2021 6:16
1901,1901, haha no I don't how do they do it? some kind of weird instrument?,9/27/2017 17:52
1902,1902, Yeah I guess it is called a waterphone.  Sounds like a pretty crazy instrument to me. ,8/1/1979 0:04
1902,1011," ya I need to look up what that sounds like, also I shoudl watch more horror movies apparently you can burn almost 200 calores from watching one, that would help me lose weight!",2/6/1975 16:53

1902,1902," Yeah good call, the Shining is one of the best ever.  Halloween is a good one too and so is Nightmare.  I really like Rosemary's Baby, have you seen that one?",6/22/1975 2:57
1902,1902," no I haven't, what is that about? I have heard of it but I haven't seen it yet",5/15/2019 19:50
1902,1011," It is really good, it is about a wife who gets set up by her husband and she gives birth to the devil basically.  ",8/14/2019 14:32
1902,1902," haha oh wow, well you like the shinning, its good to know that Danny from the movie didn't realize he was making a horror movie at the time, that could have scarred him for life!",3/26/1988 1:41
1902,1902, Yeah I think that is pretty funny though.  I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was gettin into?,4/20/1979 1:51
1902,1011, haha ya I wonder if they shot the scenes out of order or told him lies to keep it so he didn't know what he was diong haha,6/19/1988 7:32
1903,91," Yeah I think you might be right about that. On a different note, are you a user of Amazon?",11/21/1974 12:48
1903,91," ya I like to buy stuff from there, I don't have prime anymore i didn't use it enough, what about you?",12/23/1991 18:14
1903,91," Yeah I use them quite often, especially around the holidays.  Do you know what the first ever amazon purchase was?",7/9/2014 7:14

1903,1903, Yeah good call! I guess he paid $27.95 and got a building named after him yeah. ,3/13/2007 2:20
1903,1903," I mean it is cool to get a building named after you, but it would have been cooler to get something physical, really anything, instead of that haha but thats just me",1/9/1982 14:43
1903,1903, Good day. Do you like netflix?,11/16/1999 0:58
1903,91," I used to, no longer have a subscription. ",2/15/2009 6:05
1903,91, Did you know that netflix was founded by reed hastings and marc randolph in 1997?,10/23/1990 23:30
1903,91," I did know that, he is still the CEO. He was just on CNBC. ",8/4/1979 11:25
1904,1599, Ntflix has over 137 million subscribers worldwide. 58.46 million in the us alone.,8/23/2014 2:03
1904,1904, WOW! That is a lot!,1/17/1975 21:40
1904,1904, That really is a lot of subscribers. From 9pm to 12 am netflix accounts for 33% of the internet traffic in north america.,11/28/1970 1:06
1904,1599, I can believe it. I canceled my subscription because I wasn't watching it enough. ,7/18/2003 10:06
1904,1904, All in all Netflix and youtube together make up half of the peak internet traffic.,9/17/1976 11:49
1904,1904," Yeah, that is true. What do you know about the universe? ",2/14/1986 15:43
1904,1599, I know that it is all of space and time and all of their contents. So basically everything.,10/13/2016 7:02
1904,1599, Interesting. Did you know the universe may exist inside a black hole? ,1/17/2011 5:08
1904,1904, Yeah I heard that. So do you think that the Universe evolved thropugh natural selection like humans have?,3/3/1986 6:54
1904,1904," It could be true. To be honest, nobody really knows. ",6/21/1990 0:19
1905,1905, I think it is. I mean its just a bunch of rocks floating through space. The bigger ones are going to encapsulate the smaller ones over time.,1/29/1991 1:09
1905,945," Yeah, that is true. What do you know about robots? ",4/15/2007 1:33
1905,1905, I heard that Michael jackson had planned to build a 50 ft robot to moonwalk the deserts of las vegas.,7/13/1980 23:35
1905,945," OMG, that's hilarious. Who actually knows what that guy was thinking. ",4/13/1993 23:06
1905,1905, This is kind of scary to me. I guess they can use a rats brain to control a robot. It wont be long until they can do it with humans.,10/18/1993 15:55
1905,1905," I wouldn't be surprised if they've already tried. Well, nice chatting with you!",4/29/2004 23:43
1905,1905, It was a lovely chat. Have a wonderful day.,9/24/2021 3:15
1905,945," hi there, do you watch the NBA?",6/13/1972 1:50
1905,945, Yes I do. Do you know who Reggie Miller is?,3/30/1989 9:30
1905,945, Yes the NBA player that was always beaten at the game by his sister,3/13/1980 7:12
1906,1493," Yes the woman was a star, broke 8 national records once",7/21/1970 3:20

1906,1906, Yeah sweet deal the guy is pretty much set for life now,5/14/2010 5:18
1906,1493, Yeah. Do you ever practice the granny shot?,3/1/2016 1:44
1906,1906, Yeah but players do not like it because it is funny. Do you play chess?,8/14/2011 17:24
1906,1493," Sometimes, there are more positive moves than atoms alltogether in the universe",8/28/1977 21:23
1906,1493, Wow nice. The president of the federation believes it is invented by aliens,1/16/2016 4:07
1906,1493, Wow. Judit Polgar beat someone at it when she was only 5,11/18/1978 22:33
1907,1181, Wow nice smart kid. The game was invented in India and not by aliens though,10/3/2010 21:41
1907,1181, Haha yeah during the Gupta empire actually.,7/30/1994 5:50
1907,1907, Yeah. DO you like SPiderman?,11/16/2004 5:51
1907,1907, I love the movies. Do you know why it has a hyphen in the name?,12/2/1994 2:54
1907,1907, Yes so it can be distinguished from Superman as they sound similar,3/6/1981 23:45
1907,1181, Yeah. Stan Lee's wife did the voice for Madame Web in the early SPider-man series,3/22/1976 0:11
1907,1907," Wow that is awesome, they were both into these kind of things.",5/22/2002 8:34
1907,1181, So awesome. Spiderman is also the most expensive Broadway production,12/12/2009 2:31
1907,1907, Hey there are you a spiderman fan? Or should I say spider-man...Stan Lee used the hyphen so people wouldn't confuse him with superman!,10/14/2001 3:11
1907,1181, Spider man is a fictional super-hero created by Stan lee.  He has appeared in comic books.,10/24/1996 0:30
1908,1520, Yes he is. More specifically he is the alias of Peter Parker who is an orphan because his parents were killed.,12/23/1978 4:36
1908,1520," He is lived with his uncle. Peter is very innocent boy,  He is character is designed with adolescence and financial problems.",6/3/2003 2:02
1908,1908, Yes have you ever seen the Spiderman movie? The movie was created by Sony because they have the cinematic rights to Spiderman.,11/26/2011 16:26
1908,1908, He appears in American comic books which are published by Marvel Comics. Spider man first appeared in 1960.,10/13/1981 23:45
1908,1520, I thought he first appeared in the amazing fantasy number 15 which was published in August 1962. This was the silver age of comic books.,4/23/1971 14:15
1908,1520, It is very interesting to know it. I think you read comic books. Who is your superhero ?,4/22/2020 14:32
1908,1520, I like Superman. But Spiderman is cool too. I would love to see the Broadway musical about Spiderman. It was the most expensive production in Broadway history.,9/13/1981 9:51
1908,1520, Music also plays an important role in superhero movies.  Graphic designers have an important job too.,6/30/2014 23:38
1908,1908, Yes you are right. Did you know Stan Lee's wife voiced Madame Web in the 1994 spiderman series?,11/1/2013 19:52
1908,1520, Stan lee did not want people to confuse spider-man with superman. They're different movies. It is very tough for designers to make dresses- it requires a lot of effort.,11/25/1970 7:49
1909,1909, Yes it does. Cap'n Crunch arch rivals sogmaster and the soggies exist in the marvel universe and have even battled spiderman! That is so funny.,5/23/1985 3:21
1909,1909," Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?",2/5/2011 12:37
1909,1823," I love basketball and especially the NBA. It was founded in New York on June 6, 1946.",7/4/2002 20:26
1909,1823," It is the famous US pastime. In the middle ages, large numbers of people played this game in towns and cities. It was quite popular.",1/26/1981 10:51
1909,1909, Yes it is one of my favorites. The NBA banned air Jordans in the past but he wore them anyway because Nike paid the fines before each game.,11/21/1990 10:03
1909,1823," The league was found in June 6, 1946 as BAA. In the 1949, the league adopted it NBA, after merging with national basketball league.",2/14/2016 15:15
1909,1909, Yes. One of my favorite players was Reggie Miller. But his sister was almost better than him. It was pleasant talking with you this morning.,7/20/1994 10:21
1909,1909, Very nice chatting with you. Have great day.,9/7/1970 15:18
1909,1909, Bye now!,1/19/2018 6:26
1909,1823, Hi! Do you enjoy reading? I've been wanting to read Starship Troopers since it's the first Sci-Fi novel to make the reading lists of three US military branches! It must be great!,8/6/1978 17:36
1910,360," I love reading. I read starship troopers a long time ago. saw the movie too. Heinlein was in the military. the navy, i think.",2/23/2013 13:17
1910,1910, That's awesome! I'd also like to read Ender's Game as it's also suggested for military organizations even including the Marine corps! ,10/18/1985 12:31
1910,360," i never saw the movie for that, but i did read the book. Orson Scott Card is a great writer. would you ride a reading bicycle?",12/4/1981 16:35
1910,360," Ha! I don't know if I'd be able to. But what I do wish is that I could read 4,700 words per minute which is a world record set by Anne Jones. Wouldn't that be awesome?",12/13/1989 17:38
1910,1910," I guess, but how much does she retain? can she remember all that info? we should give her a test a week later.",3/15/1999 23:03
1910,360," That is a good point. She probably doesn't retain much. Ha! On a related reading note, I find it sad that there was a moral panic over the spread of the reading of novels back in the 18th Century. I'm so glad we don't love back in those times.",7/8/1984 18:43
1910,1910," Yeah, poetry was considered the highest form of literature, and novels were vulgar, dealing with themes not suitable for civilized people.",5/23/1993 2:54
1910,360," Such a shame! But to lighten things up, Tolkien and CS Lewis both held a you laugh, you lose  competition while reading horrible poetry. I think that's hilarious! Ha! I bet they had plenty of laughs too!",2/19/1989 4:32
1910,360, I would buy tickets to that event. it sounds great. those two were terrific authors.,1/19/2021 4:57
1910,360," Indeed they were! Speaking of authors and books, do you like libraries? I'm glad to hear there are still more libraries than there are McDonald's here in the US and over half the adult population still has library cards! That gives me a little hope!",11/27/2005 4:23
1911,1432," I am amazed by that fact. there is so much obesity in the US, i figure it would be the other way around. maybe we could combined libraries and fast food? LOL",3/16/2021 11:31
1911,1911," Hey, maybe so! It would be similar to the Sacramento library that started a library of things where they let you check out stuff you may need temporarily but don't want to own like sewing machines!",7/25/1981 19:38
1911,1432," the tool library is an awesome idea. many people dont have enough money for some basic tools. reduce, reuse recycle. it is a good system.",1/1/1974 15:19
1911,1911," That is a great idea, actually. I wonder if they sell tools at the library of things? Speaking of libraries, I think it's nice that if you publish a book in Norway, the government there buys 1000 copies and distributes them to libraries across their country. I wish every government would do that!",5/5/1988 17:17
1911,1911, I will move to Norway. I will write childrens books and become rich. that is now my plan. Yes!,9/2/2020 7:32
1911,1432," It's a great idea. We mentioned the library of things previously, but I wonder if they also rent out legos?   I love Legos! In fact, the German  Lego factory would give out a 14k gold Lego brick to employees who had worked there for 25 years back in the early 80s. I think that is awesome and it's too bad they still don't do that today!",4/3/1978 12:38
1911,1432, I think that is great. I would love to work for Lego. I think the library just lends out tools for adults. ,9/6/2017 16:21
1911,1432," Probably so! Well speaking of legos, did you ever hear about that German graffiti artist who painted a 250 square meter bridge to resemble a lego? That takes serious talent. Ha!",7/20/1999 2:08
1911,1432," That is a cool way to decorate the urban landscape ! Anyway, thanks for the chat!",9/28/1973 8:11
1911,1432," Agreed it is! But Legos are so popular now, as it has movies, amusement parks, games and competitions all under it's name brand. Well thanks for chatting with me as well. Hope you have a great day, friend!",7/26/2009 7:00
1912,768," You, too! Have a great day.",10/24/2008 7:42
1912,1912, You have a great day as well! I'm off to read how Lego replaced Ferrari as the world's most powerful brand. Ha! Take care!,7/3/2008 4:25
1912,1912," How's it going, have you ever played with Legos? I never knew the company that owns them is from Denmark",5/18/2003 5:48
1912,768," Yes, The cool thing is that Legos are too much fun. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects including vehicles, buildings, and working robots.",6/24/1996 3:18
1912,1912," Yea, they have been one of the best toys since Legos came out in 1949",2/4/2003 1:31
1912,1912," I agree and they also support movies, games, competitions as well as six Legoland amusement parks. These have all been developed under the Lego brand.",8/2/2003 13:41
1912,1912, That's pretty cool. DId you know only 18 out of 10000000 lego bricks produced are defective?,10/25/1976 13:01
1912,1912," That's a great percentage of low defects.  To top that off, legos are so consistent that they allow these bricks manufactured today to interlock with the ones made back in 1958. ",4/24/2003 13:52
1912,768," That's pretty cool, they also treat their employees well, in the german lego factory some even got a 14 karat gold lego brick",6/18/2020 11:37
1912,768, That is awesome.  Did you know that a German graffiti artist painted a 250 square meter bridge to make it look like it was made out of legos?,9/23/1984 18:52
1913,1913," No but that sounds like a nice piece of art, I wonder if drivers were scared to drive on the lego looking bridge",9/19/1981 3:09
1913,1913," I know, right?  Lego is now investing millions to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of an environmentally friendly alternative.",4/27/2005 9:41
1913,1913," That's pretty cool, I wonder if their are any good lego books.",9/22/2006 12:29
1913,24, I'm not sure but if all the lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would own 86 lego bricks.,3/17/2018 5:41
1913,24, Nice. Have you've ever read Starship Troopers? It's on the reading list of the US military,9/2/2009 0:23
1913,24," No, I haven't.  I do know that in the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels.",10/14/2007 21:33
1913,1913," I wonder what made people in the 18th century have a moral panic lol, maybe it was because most people couldn't read",7/15/1981 6:09
1913,24," That could be. It's hard to say.  Do you like the library?  Did you know that a library collection includes not only books but periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microfilmn, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-rays, e-books, databases and other formats?",8/23/2008 11:02
1913,24," Yea, in Norway if you publish a book the government buys 1000 copies to put into the library",8/12/2011 16:31
1913,24, That is great. Did you know that there are more libraries than McDonalds in the US and over half of all adults have a library card?,11/12/2012 14:12
1914,1914, Lol no but it's good to know theres more libraries than McDonalds,4/18/2009 9:21
1914,1914," I was surprised at that myself. Did you know that a man falsely imprisoned for 10 years spent most of his time at the library to study law and prove his innocence, and then became a lawyer to help free other people who have been falsely convicted?",3/24/2010 8:42
1914,123," Nope, glad he got out. Well it was nice chatting with you",2/5/1984 21:03
1914,1914, Memes like the cursed sarcophagus are really odd.,12/20/1982 15:22
1914,123, What makes you say that?,5/4/2014 21:31
1914,123, I think the fact something based in fact iike archaeologists discoveries can quickly become an obsession.,3/16/2004 6:13
1914,1914, I thought it started with finding three skeletons in one sarcophagus,8/17/2016 18:04
1914,1914," It did, but archaeologists found the skeletons and a mysterious liquid.",3/4/1986 19:13
1914,1914, Some believe the liquid to be an energy drink and some believe it to be vaping juice.,6/18/1982 12:43
1914,123, Somebody even jokingly called it sauce and called for baking a fused ziti.,11/12/1999 2:24
1915,701, I would have preferred to sign the petition for the energy drink.,7/13/1999 18:07
1915,1915," Perhaps, but this takes me back to silly memes and a 4.5 billion year old planet.",4/4/1995 9:05
1915,701, We have enough energy from the sun to keep the planet running for hundreds of thousands of years,12/7/2007 6:08
1915,1915," True, but More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed",9/7/1986 2:27
1915,701, Thankfully we have plenty of water in reserve so as long as we don't pollute it,12/24/2017 17:07
1915,1915," In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials - perhaps they can help with that!",4/25/2000 8:57
1915,1915, I find that a bit odd and haven't been able to verify that fact. Its like the UN having an amabassador for the sarcophagus too,5/22/2014 7:17
1915,1915," I'd like to see someone post a video on the second largest search engine, YouTube about that!",3/27/1987 17:22
1915,1915, I might start my own channel on YouTube dedicated to the sarcophagus findings,7/22/1971 8:06
1915,701," Good luck with that, just don't repost Justin bieber's baby - it is the most disliked video on youtube",6/14/2000 18:38
1916,556, I hate that video too...I might make a parody of it instead.,3/12/2000 0:49
1916,1916," I would try and get it on someplace other than Pandora radio, so the rest of the world can hear it.",8/16/1982 8:51
1916,556," Pandora is relatively new, started in 2017 so I am not sure I will have enough followers on Pandora versus YOuTube",3/5/1977 7:12
1916,1916," True, although Pandora now streams comedy, so that might help!",12/4/2009 16:10
1916,1916, Hello there. How great is the planet we live on? It was formed 4.5 billion years ago.,7/16/1994 10:19
1916,556, Good morning!  It is great I agree.  I think it's amazing that over 70% of it is covered in water.,1/7/2018 2:06
1916,1916," Yes I love water. Most of the water is from oceans but some of it is from lakes, rivers, and other sources.",3/28/1990 2:25
1916,556, I do too.  Have you heard about the forests being destroyed?,2/13/2003 4:14
1916,1916, Yes I can't believe more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed.,10/15/1985 13:56
1916,556, I know.  I can't help but wonder what that is going to mean for the planet in the long run.  Will it have an effect on the earth's polar regions which are covered in ice?,4/19/1970 22:15
1917,599," Yes I think it will and already has. Also, earth will be virtually Helium free by the end of the twenty first Century.",9/10/2001 2:55
1917,1917," That's an interesting thought. Helium has to be used for more than just blowing up balloons so that will change things I guess.  Also, everything natural with the planet is probably important in some way to it so things will change planet wise too.",2/22/1980 23:45
1917,1917, Yes I completely agree. And in the big scheme of things the lives of humans is so small relative to the earth.,10/23/1989 8:35
1917,1917, Very true.  I've heard that if earth's history was viewed as a day we would only be just over a minute of it.,1/4/2016 14:26
1917,599, Yes I can't believe it. I think it's fascinating that the earth's interior has a solid inner core and the liquid outer core that generate's a magnetic field.,1/17/1983 8:09
1917,1917, That is interesting.  Do you find it interesting also how the earth and moon interact?,11/21/2006 9:03
1917,1917, Oh yes definitely. Thanks for that interaction we get our ocean tides. I am sure the surfers are grateful as well!,10/8/2012 17:25
1917,599, True!  Isn't it amazing how everything works and such?  Without the moon the planet would rotate a great deal faster too.  Imagine what that would be like.,11/24/2017 9:49
1917,599, Yes who knows what it would be like. There definitely wouldn't be a YouTube. Google actually bought youtube back in 2006.,6/8/1992 7:21
1917,599," Youtube must have had rapid growth in it's first year because it was just created in 2005 and then like you said, Google buys it the next year.",9/17/1994 16:57
1918,1918, Yes and for a big sum of 1.65 billion dollars. They really cashed out!,12/13/2011 21:53
1918,1074, They really did!  Did you know it's the second largest search engine on the net?,10/26/2010 1:07
1918,1074, I actually didn't realize that. Justin Bieber's Baby is the most disliked video on the site. People must be jealous. Well it was lovely chatting with you this morning.,5/22/2005 19:59
1918,1074, People are also busy watching.  Youtube combined with Netflix makes up half of peak internet traffic in the country.  It's been nice chatting with you as well!,4/18/1985 0:58
1918,1918, Police also have their own called blutube! Have a good day!,12/26/2004 0:43
1918,1074, hi how are you? are you good over there today on the other side of the internet? things are pretty good here.,5/20/2018 7:26
1918,1074, Its pretty good.  Did you watch the Oscars the other night?  That is always a fun show,2/12/2020 19:22
1918,1074," i did not watch the oscars. normally the show is boring (well, to me). a bit slow. i check the next day to see who won. ",9/23/2001 11:08
1918,1074, Did you know that Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?,8/3/1975 10:15
1918,1074, he deserves it. the man is a genius. MY LEFT FOOT. amazing performance. tom hanks won tice.,7/24/2010 6:38
1919,1919, Blazing Saddles was even nominated for 3 oscars - great flick!,6/6/2021 22:25
1919,1919, that was an AWESOME flick. could not be made these days. too much language. maybe as a south park episode.,3/23/1970 16:33
1919,1919, Though tamer flicks are still popular - Walt Disney won 22 oscars,3/19/2006 7:34
1919,1919, Uncle Walt knew how to please an audience.quality was always there. quality always lasts.,5/6/1994 4:36
1919,661," Yes for sure - though somehow enimen has more oscars than decaprio, depp, will smith, george lucas and bill murray combined.  How the heck did that happen?",9/29/1987 14:14
1919,1919," eminem is pretty cool, but really the oscars seem too political. i figure they dole out favors to their favorites. ",4/14/2016 6:10
1919,661, Maybe - but oddly enough the Oscars was nominated for  9 emmys in 2013!,5/19/1977 20:40
1919,661, i dont understand myself. the show is a bit slow for my taste. i figure that they are doing each other favors or something?,11/8/1999 13:07
1919,661, I don't know.  Do you like basketball?  College basketball tends to go at a faster pace,11/4/2006 10:20
1919,1919, the college game is for fun. i think the kids want to play their hearts out. the pros have other plans.,4/29/1972 12:10
1920,147, That is for sure although Kareem Abdul Jabbar got the dunk banned in college basketball for over 10 years,1/12/2004 1:11
1920,147, They had it in for the man. he was too good. and he was changing the game without the permission of the forces that be.,1/1/2011 14:52
1920,1920, Yes.  I am not sure the coaches deserve that much pay however - in 39 states a football or basketball coach makes the most money,6/17/1996 23:23
1920,147," the coaches are not the most important, but they get paid the most. anyway, great chat there!",8/12/2022 2:35
1920,147, Yes I would personally rather play basketball at the US supreme court,8/23/1985 14:50
1920,1920, I would not. Have a great day!,2/4/2003 3:05
1920,147, Yes but I would have a better chance of beating Ginsberg than Jordan!,6/8/1996 10:58
1920,1920, Hi! Are you a fan of Jordan Peele? I'm so glad he won an Oscar for Get Out. Thankfully he finished writing it after stopping 20 times!,4/14/2016 5:59
1920,1920," Somewhat, Its good he didn't give up.  Glad he won the Oscar too! I'm not surprised Walt Disney holds the record for the most Oscars.",3/25/1978 9:36
1920,147, I'm not surprised either honestly. Just as I wasn't too surprised to discover Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win an Oscar for best actor three times! ,6/12/1994 17:19
1921,1733, Oh I know. He's the best actor. All of his movies are great!!,10/8/2004 0:26
1921,1733, So true! Were you also a fan of Blazing Saddles? It's crazy it was nominated for three Oscars! Now that surprised me. Ha!,5/27/2020 10:40
1921,1733," Yes, that's funny. I can remember it. Did you see Frozen? It was inspired by The Snow Queen.",12/5/2008 17:05
1921,1733," That's interesting! I wasn't aware of that! I do know that Jennifer Lee, the writer and co-director, was the first Disney animation feature film female director and also the first female director whose movie made more than 1 billion at the box office. That was awesome and quite an accomplishment!",10/16/1977 17:37
1921,1921," Agree, being the first female.Robert Lopez is one of twelve people to win an emmy, grammy, oscar and a tony!",11/14/2014 14:56
1921,1733," Wow! Now that's truly an accomplishment right there. Talk about a jack of all trades! And here I thought Eminem having more Oscars than Johnny Depp, Leo, Will Smith, Bill Murray and George Lucas combined was impressive, not as impressive as Robert Lopez's accomplishments. Ha!",5/27/2018 17:49
1921,1921, Do you watch basketball? I didn't know New Zealand had a team.,6/5/1996 13:09
1921,1733," I wasn't aware of that either. I do watch and enjoy basketball though. I do think it's crazy the highest paid employee in 39 of the 50 states are either college football or basketball coaches. That's kind of sad, really.",7/3/1988 21:59
1921,1733," lol, I agree. James Naismith who invented basketball is the only losing coach at the University of Kansas.",12/14/2012 17:31
1921,1921," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? Did you know there's a basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building which is called the highest court in the land? Ha!",9/15/2012 21:16
1922,1238, Good name!! Great way to get exercise at work.,3/12/1994 19:57
1922,1238, No kidding! Ha! But them there's athlete's like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who got dunking banned from college basketball for over a decade. He must have been a monster dunker!,12/22/1971 19:02
1922,1238," lol, i agree to get banned.",12/16/1996 5:09
1922,1238," We talked about the Oscars earlier, did you also know that the Oscars themselves were nominated for 9 Emmys back in 2013?",9/12/2009 8:42
1922,1238," Yes, I saw that. How does that work?",3/18/2019 17:08
1922,1922," Good question. Ha! Since the Emmys are basically the Oscar equivalent for television and was modeled after the Oscars, it's a little strange!",3/29/2014 1:04
1922,1922, yeah! It doesn't make sense. lol Have a good night!! Good chat!,9/12/1978 9:27
1922,1238," True. But as long as the Oscars keep awarding and nominating first time directors like Jordan Peele, then they deserve awards too I suppose. Crazy he's only the third first time director to have their directorial debuts appear in all three categories. Well it was great chatting with you as well. Have a great evening!",12/5/2004 11:11
1922,1922," Hi there, do you watch the Academy Awards?",10/23/2013 7:16
1922,1922," Occasionally.  I am not a fan of the political commentary, but I enjoy seeing the actors recognized for fine performances.",9/27/1984 7:30
1923,156, Nice. Did you ever watch Blazzing Saddles? It was nominated for three Oscars,12/18/2020 14:45
1923,156," Oh, yeah. Lilly von Shtoop is a fine actress... But I prefer the acting of legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis, the only actor to win best actor 3 times",12/12/1985 18:07
1923,1923, Yeah that is quite something for him. Funny enough Eminem has won more Oscars than Leo di Caprio,7/2/2003 3:23
1923,156," I would never have guessed that one. But I would have guessed that Walt Disney would be recognized, but 22 oscars? Unreal!",11/17/1994 12:33
1923,1923, I know they guy has set the standard too high now. Even Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys. Strange,10/1/1983 7:25
1923,1923," And the Emmy for best Academy Awards show goes to...the Academy Awards. Accepting on behalf of the Academy, James Naismith, the inventor of the game of basketball, who also is the only losing coach in Univ of Kansas history!",9/28/1975 19:06
1923,1923, Hhahaha that is so strange really. I guess it took a while to get the game going. Still those coaches are the highest paid state employees,4/25/1972 14:04
1923,1923," Yeah. Strange world we live in. One where New Zealand nicknames their basketball team, the Tall Blacks!",9/11/1995 2:18
1923,156, I wonder how that flies there really. Have you heard of the highest court on land?,5/18/1989 10:55
1923,1923," Yes, the basketball court where Ruth Bader-Ginsberg dominates at the boards! ",2/7/1986 10:28
1924,1924, I wonder how tall that building is really.  Do you ever watch animated movies?,5/24/2006 13:10
1924,1301," Yes, I loved the film, Frozen. You?",9/17/1975 17:19
1924,1924," Yes me too. ,It was the first DIsney movie to be written directed by a female",7/13/1997 3:33
1924,1924," Yeah, and the first female to direct a feature film that earned more than $1 billion. Now that is shattering the glass(ice) ceiling!",7/24/2001 2:15
1924,1924, What an achievement. Did you know Elsa was originally scripted to be the villain?,10/25/2012 23:45
1924,1924," Ah, but with such a great song--Let it go--how could she remain a villian?",2/5/2019 6:50
1924,1924, I know that is the only reason she was changed to a good character because the song was so uplifting,4/12/1997 21:47
1924,1924," And to think, the movie Frozen was originally going to be called Snow Queen  but the folks at Disney decided that feminine names are bad...",8/2/1993 11:17
1924,1924," THat makes me sad honestly, that we judge based on that.",10/4/1973 4:33
1924,1301, lets talk about earth. Its sad that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed,4/8/1994 23:12
1925,1283, Yes it could have happened during the  4.5 billion years of existing.,11/25/1980 20:05
1925,1283, How did they know that a day was only 5.5 hours long ?,2/26/2008 4:15
1925,1925, yeah thats When earth was first formed,8/29/2004 5:26
1925,1925, Wow Earth will be virtually helium-free ,1/8/2010 1:23
1925,1283, By the end of this century. I wonder why .,11/22/1993 23:01
1925,1283, the united nations  thinks that aliens will visit us,11/20/1982 15:29
1925,1925, Yes they appointed  a official ambassador ,1/1/1985 19:41
1925,1283, I love you tube. Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net.,1/23/1976 9:53
1925,1283, Google bought the Good investment site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion,7/20/1988 21:32
1925,1283, I have never seen Justin bieber's baby ,1/30/2008 0:47
1926,1686, No one liked it lol ,11/27/1991 0:55
1926,1926, Netflix and youtube eats up all the internet traffic in north america,5/1/2004 23:51
1926,1926, And most of it is in my house. I love Netflix and YouTube,11/2/1986 19:31
1926,1926, I would like to check out blutube,8/24/2016 3:30
1926,1686," Me too. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim are genuineness ",5/6/1982 22:11
1926,1926, You know I really dont like Pandora because of the freemium service platform,4/15/1987 9:39
1926,1686, Its cool with me. Aloe blacc only received $12k in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams,2/28/2020 20:32
1926,1686, I do like the comedy ,2/19/2004 20:09
1926,1926, Yes the stand up is funny and has lots of good people,7/31/1998 14:47
1926,1686, You are excellent. I will listen to pandora now,11/22/1976 1:20
1927,1927, Hi! Are you into politics? Did you follow the interesting Senate race in Texas this year?,8/24/2022 5:52
1927,1927," I've heard a litte, O'Rourke really gave Cruz a run for his money",5/24/2020 13:32
1927,1294," Yeah, I think it's because of his charisma, good timing, and viral videos of him defending progressive ideals and policies. Not sure what relentless shoe-leather politicking means though.",2/21/2010 13:17
1927,1294, Yea I'm sure O'Rourke being an electric bassist in the 90s helped him seem more relatable,3/15/1987 18:20
1927,1927, Yeah! He even toured the US and Canada with his punk rock band!,8/7/2019 16:31
1927,1927," Yea, Ted Cruz seems out of touch, especially tweeting a photo of O'rourke from when he was in the band",1/20/2014 12:20
1927,1927," Wonder if that was a tactic he used to bash each other. It's too bad that despite his progressive views, young people vote at significantly lower rates that older voters and in Texas that could be a bad thing for O'Rourke",8/11/2018 23:49
1927,1294," Yea, apparently baby boomers don't like rock music or long hair",8/6/2000 20:05
1927,1927," Maybe they like beards, because every US president with a beard has been a republican.",5/28/2010 10:19
1927,1927," Yea and since 1928 every republican ticket has had a Bush or it too, or a Nixon",7/23/2007 19:03
1928,141," Oh wow, that is true! Maybe the next election would break the record that there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1800s",1/18/1979 1:41
1928,1928," Yea, the US needs more colors than just red and blue",1/15/1987 8:47
1928,1928," Or different animals, do you know what other parties representative colors and animals are?",10/28/2009 23:12
1928,1928, I know Democrats are an ass and the Republican are elephants for some reason. Apparently Harry Truman didn't want to be photographed riding dumbo because he was an elephant,2/8/1996 6:16
1928,141," I would vote for him, he's loyal to his party! Are presidents a form of celebrity because if they are, they get to visit Pixar studios which has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities.",7/26/1999 23:20
1928,141," I would suppose so, celebrity or not I think the president can visit Pixar's secret room",6/3/1975 21:27
1928,1928," Yeah, does that mean secret service agents can go in as well? ",2/6/2008 0:19
1928,1928," I suppose. I wonder if Judge Judy has a secret room, she can afford one making 123,000 an episode",6/15/2003 19:34
1928,1928," I can't believe she's the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James, I remember reading somewhere that the main character on the show House made the most",12/9/1995 15:55
1928,1928," Yea, I wonder if she's a republican or a democrat that supports social programs, labor unions, and universal healthcare",7/25/1991 16:36
1929,1865," Seeing that she deals with certain issues, she may be a Democrat but not sure. I sure am learning more about history or politics than I ever did in school.",4/1/1986 10:07
1929,1865," Yea plus I learned Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons, how ironic",10/25/1986 10:47
1929,1929, Oh really? How come?,7/18/2003 2:40
1929,1865, For parodying fox-news anti-democratic agenda. Well it was nice talking with you,6/3/2002 1:05
1929,1929, Have you heard about some politicians who actually get along????,4/4/2006 3:08
1929,1865, I don't hear about it often! How about you?,1/26/2004 2:12
1929,1865, There were two in Maryland named Baker and Legett who worked for years together and left as great friends,8/27/1989 3:02
1929,1865, I read a little on that too! It sounds like they started out as professor and student- did you read the same?,2/4/1992 22:08
1929,1929, Is that what happened? I wasn't quite sure. ,12/2/2018 9:45
1929,1865, Yeah I guess Baker was a law student at Howard and Leggett was the dean who pushed him to finish school. Cool story! I don't feel like I don't hear happy political stories often enough haha,7/28/2004 23:16
1930,1930, That's the truth! It sounds like toward the end they both had a lot of personal things that pushed them to leave.,2/4/1974 3:09
1930,1512, Did they? I didn't read that part. Does it sound like they were still on good terms when they left? I couldn't tell!,3/1/1982 23:26
1930,1930," They were, but aparently one of the spouses had alzheimer's and the other lost his father in that last year.",8/18/2003 11:39
1930,1512," Oh wow. That's rough. On a happier note, I was reading some interesting trivia-type facts on elections. Did you know since 1900, the taller presidential candidate has won the election 75% of the time?",8/25/2019 13:54
1930,1512, Thats cool! Interestingly less than 63% of people have turned out for elections in the last 100 years,5/8/2020 20:39
1930,1512," That's crazy! I know not everyone votes, but thats a pretty low number. Did you know officials in ancient Athens were chosen via lottery because they wanted to avoid a potential oligarchy? Apparently they thought thats what voting would lead to",3/15/2018 11:02
1930,1930, Lottery! I guess then there is a chance everyone could be in charge. In nevada you can vote for none of the above!,5/24/2013 13:36
1930,1512, I read that too! I wonder what would happen if everyone selected that. I guess its only one state in a presidential election so maybe it wouldn't be noticeable.,7/20/2008 5:25
1930,1512, I may move there and try it out next time! Hopefully they don't block poll observers like was done in 2012,7/12/1977 3:04
1930,1930, Yeah that option might have come in handy for the last election! I wonder if they give the same option for smaller/local elections?,9/14/2000 13:10
1931,1931, My favorite album was written and released by Pink Floyd in 1973 but still a best seller in 2014,7/23/1982 15:05
1931,1645, Yeah! I love Dark Side of the Moon! Not surprising its still relevant. Did you know Straight Outta Compton was the first album to go platinum without touring or airplay?,5/25/1971 6:43
1931,1645, I didn't! that is awesome! ,5/7/1993 8:34
1931,1931," Speaking of rap, apparently there were two 100 year old twins who released a rap album together in 1992...probably didn't go platinum but kind of a funny fact!",1/8/1997 20:49
1931,1645, Have a great afternoon,3/31/1997 3:23
1931,1931, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),4/18/1993 6:33
1931,1931," Hello, looking forward to it as well.",8/21/1974 11:26
1931,1931, By any chance You're Linking Park's fan ?,5/11/2010 9:39
1931,1645, I do like Linkin Park may favorite CD was hybrid theory. what about you?,9/18/2021 8:03
1931,1645, I like a song or two - yeah -  hybrid theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century - pretty amazing. Do You have a favorite song ?,9/4/1982 7:19
1932,1932, My favorite on that album is In the End. ,10/30/1986 9:12
1932,251, YES ;) mine too. That vocal was amazing ! ;)  was... such a shame...,6/15/2009 11:12
1932,251,  It is really too bad. What other music do you like?,6/10/2021 3:14
1932,1932," Mostly classic rock, blues. Some metal or Celtic folk - how about You ?",2/27/1994 6:45
1932,1932," I have a pretty diverse taste in music. Rap, R & B, Classic Rock, pop ect. I was really into rap as kid did you know the Nwa's straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the suppor airplay.",2/8/1995 23:56
1932,251," Naah man, I didn't know that ;) I never liked rap - no offense, I didn't find it... well - musical enough ;)",12/30/2000 3:43
1932,251, TO each their own. I got into it because I liked Tupac and his lyrics and poems. There where two identical twins from Japan that made an album at the age of 100.,1/21/1986 10:10
1932,1932, I will never understand that ;) ( the Tupac thing )  - 100 years and they made an album ? music album ? Do You know what kind of music ?,4/11/2014 7:36
1932,1932, It was a rap album!,4/21/2016 1:22
1932,251, of course it was... ;) lol,9/22/1979 17:20
1933,294, Lol. Foreign rap is not my cup of tea but good for them. Did you know that Darkside of the moon is still one of the best selling albums even being 40 years old? ,8/8/2005 13:55
1933,294, Thank God we're talking about music finally ;) Well I'm not surprised it's a great album and after all those years I still can't get enough of it - I just bought a vinyl like 2 weeks ago... do You like Pink Floyd ?,9/11/1976 23:59
1933,1933, I do I am pretty eclectic. What is your favorite song?,10/10/1981 8:08
1933,1933, from that album ? I think Breathe and Time  I do love The Division Bell and High Hopes on that album. Plus entire The Wall ;) what's Yours ?,5/22/2017 0:21
1933,294, From darkside of the moon I would agree with breathe and over all Pink Floyd song Idk there are so many to pick just one,7/16/2004 9:17
1933,1933," You are absolutely right my friend ;) I hope Roger Waters will do another tour in US, I want to see him again ;)",4/25/1999 18:40
1933,1933, That would be awesome. What other music do you like?,8/9/1986 20:32
1933,1933," I love Joe Bonamassa, Nirvana, Dire Straits, Metallica, -recently I've discovered Black Country Communion and Kingdom Come ;) and if You like something really peaceful I recommend Loreena McKennit ;)",1/7/1982 8:52
1933,294," I think it is interesting how people can vary so much. Even with my kids. My oldest likes rap and pop, my youngest likes pop and my 4 year old likes rock and classic rock. ",4/13/2009 15:45
1933,1933," oh good for them :) my daughter when she was like 1, she was always falling asleep to Metallica ;) it was her lullaby :)",3/16/1972 0:42
1934,1934," Nice, he is like rock radar. He always finds good music on the radio. The other two just want to listen to uptown funk on repeat",3/13/1996 1:18
1934,657," that's ok, what's most important is that they like music - taste will probably change once or twice in their lives ;)",2/6/2021 15:38
1934,1934, Agreed :),12/6/2009 8:58
1934,1934," Hey it was great chatting with You today, thank You ;)",11/25/1994 8:50
1934,657, You too!,4/17/2006 2:09
1934,657, hi how are you? Do you listen to albums these days?,4/27/2012 11:24
1934,657," Hi, I'm good. Yes I listen to albums. Are you familiar with the Moody Blues?",9/12/1982 13:09
1934,1934," Yes, i am! wow, that is going back a ways. what album?",10/7/2019 6:15
1934,657, I go back a ways. The Dark Side of The Moon was one of the best selling albums of 2014.,6/22/1984 17:14
1934,657," Yes, it was a great album and continues to get new fans every year. Have you tried the dark side of oz, since you go back a ways?",8/4/1986 16:48
1935,1935," No, what is that?",4/12/1995 20:39
1935,21," Watch the Wizard of Oz. at a certain point in the film, turn on Dark side as the soundtrack.",10/5/1974 13:52
1935,21," Okay I'll give that a try. Given how quickly we have gone from records, to tapes, to Cd's, how long do you think is will be before Cd's are obsolete?",2/6/2004 0:33
1935,1935, No need for physical media soon. i figure people will not want to own stuff that takes up space.,6/30/2017 7:10
1935,1935, Exactly. But there are still people who think that 33's have a better sound. I'm not one of them. What do you think?,9/2/2011 11:46
1935,1935, I do not see the value in old recordings on old media. they are warmer because of the high end roll off but i figure you can emulate that with software.,10/11/2019 21:13
1935,1935, I think so too. Are you old enough to remember 8 track tapes?,8/30/1976 4:03
1935,1935, I do remember the 8 trax. i never owned one. i guess they sounded better? seems to be expensive but not that much better.,10/29/1998 9:32
1935,1935, No they didn't sound better. But at the time it was the first media that you could play in a car. We thought they were great. But they really sucked.,4/10/1975 3:41
1935,21," Yeah, people like convenience more than quality, i think. the walkman was convenient but the sound was limited.",3/23/2013 16:43
1936,1936," Yeah, I think they just didn't have enough power to generate good sound. But I think the ultimate is still the reel to reel if you don't mind the space they take up.",6/17/1977 14:39
1936,1936," Wow, that is an expensive setup. I would rather have something convenient. i like sound, and appreciate good sound, but i dont have the money for the high end. LOL",2/24/1977 18:26
1936,368, I don't either. But I think recording studios still make the initial recordings on these devices.,1/27/1975 18:28
1936,1936," I thought things would be digital now for convenience. Anyway, great chat!",12/27/1970 13:01
1936,368, Yes. Thanks for the chat and have a good evening.,4/11/1977 19:40
1936,1936, Have a good night!,6/4/1979 6:36
1936,1936, Thanks.,1/12/2002 20:49
1936,368, Do you have a favorite celebrity?,3/20/1998 6:51
1936,1936," Do Youtube personalities that are famous count as a celebrity? If they do, I really like a dude named Michael Jones.",9/22/1983 13:38
1936,1936," That is fine me with, I think celebrity is anyone famous to many people. What does Michael Jones do?",12/29/1978 23:40
1937,1937," He works for a company called Roosterteeth, and to be fair they have made 2 movies which he was the main character of both.",7/13/1984 9:15
1937,1545, interesting I will have to check it out. I wonder how much he makes for those. Judge Judy makes like 123000 per episode,2/17/1994 20:47
1937,1545," Speaking of Judge Judy, did you know her bailiff Petri Hawkins-Byrd makes a million per year from that show, pretty crazy since he doesn't really do anything haha.",3/20/1973 21:30
1937,1545," WHAT! i would love to do that and get paid that much to stand around and be in front of the camera, lol!",1/19/2011 19:36
1937,1937, Yeah that is pretty crazy money for doing literally nothing lol. Did you know that robin Williams started the trend of celebrities doing voice overs for animation with his role in Aladdin?,3/13/1998 17:44
1937,1545," I did not know that, I still don't get why celebrities need to be in animated films because of their voice, but it was awesome though ",4/5/2004 13:54
1937,1937," For me it really depends on the voice, Robin Williams was almost made for animated voice acting just because of his range in doing different voices.",12/2/1993 18:49
1937,1545," Yea lol, he was amazing, sad he is with us no longer! I wonder if he got to visit Pixar's secret room for celebrities",4/24/1990 8:49
1937,1937," I am sure he did, as much animation work as he was doing. Did you know Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?",7/31/2002 7:55
1937,1937," Wow, I never knew that. I was just watching that with my daughter, it is all celebrities now!",11/8/1979 3:50
1938,1938, Did you there has not been a US president that was not a republican or democrat since 1853? that just shows how strongly people believe in the two party system.,5/21/2009 21:46
1938,1622," wow, I wonder who that president was, do you know? ",3/19/1996 7:32
1938,1938," It was Millard Fillmore, he was part of a party called the Whig Party.",5/12/1971 13:00
1938,1622," lol, they need to bring the Whig Party back, I am all for that, lol! ",11/11/1978 4:12
1938,1938," Yeah the two party system in my opinion is not working all that well anymore, every time a president is up for election it just turns into a slug fest and who can find the worst stuff out about the other and air it out in front of the world.",12/11/2020 5:44
1938,1622," Right, I am interested to see how the debates go this time, Trump can't just bully them this time. It was so nice chatting with you!",1/16/1987 6:36
1938,1622, I am hoping he does not get away with his shenanigans again this coming year as well. It has been a nice chat.,6/16/2019 5:18
1938,1622, Have a great weekend!,10/19/2013 22:54
1938,1938, Do you know anything about ,4/6/1988 21:02
1938,1938, About what?,12/10/2013 13:38
1939,1939," Sorry, Beto O'Rourke.    I've been reading about him.",4/13/1984 15:30
1939,588, Is he a republican?,10/9/2003 23:07
1939,588," No, I believe he was running as a Democrat.",9/3/1999 14:27
1939,588, So what have you been reading about him?,4/29/1983 9:35
1939,1939, I read an article about why he supports National Football League players.,1/19/2010 3:57
1939,1939, What is the reason?,10/18/1991 7:36
1939,588, I would guess that he appreciates anyone expressing political opinions.,1/18/1994 10:35
1939,588, The NFL players were protesting police brutality right?,1/5/2012 4:43
1939,588," I believe so, but the specifics do not matter so much.     Beto O'Rourke appeals to young people.",4/26/1979 5:32
1939,1939, How so?,11/25/1982 18:19
1940,1940," Well, younger people tend to vote away from what they perceive as the get off my lawn candidate.",4/30/1997 7:36
1940,1940, Is it because younger people can't stand the gop?,5/16/1993 6:04
1940,1940, I do not know.    It is ironic that the GOP started as the party of classic liberalism.,3/16/1998 20:52
1940,1940, What do you think about the republican party as a whole?,11/7/1986 0:40
1940,1249, I find it interesting that every president with a Beard has been a republican.,3/3/1978 7:11
1940,1940," What a coincidence. Another coincidence may be that since wwii, the us economy consistently performs under democratic presidents",4/8/1977 16:33
1940,1249," Perhaps the country could elect someone from a third party, breaking the nearly 170-year string.",11/1/1987 3:33
1940,1940," I believe Roosevelt came incredibly close as a 3rd party, but stopped just short",5/3/2005 2:04
1940,1249," I wonder if Roosevelt could have gotten into the celebrity room at Pixar, had the studio existed.",1/21/1971 11:07
1940,1940," Perhaps, afterall, if I was Pixar, it would be an honor to have roosevelt visit. In any case, thank you for the enjoyable chat.",4/14/1979 16:12
1941,1989," Hello, do you like music albums?",7/20/2006 21:01
1941,1989, I do. Did you know that Bob Marley has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks?,7/6/1981 22:23
1941,1941, Wow I did not know that. Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album is the best selling album of the 21st century.,4/26/1973 12:22
1941,1989, Now that is hard to believe! If you're looking for a non-censored album at Walmart you won't find it. They only sell clean versions of albums and if an artist refuses to make a clean version they will not sell it.,3/7/1991 12:09
1941,1941, That's interesting! Reel Big Fish re-recorded all of their albums after losing rights to their old record label.,8/9/2001 7:56
1941,1941, Funny that they could get away with it. Good for them!,6/30/1988 8:56
1941,1941, I agree. Two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old.,3/11/2006 23:15
1941,1989," Oh, I can't imagine what that sounds like! I find it funny that Led Zeppelin decided not to title their fourth album, to confuse the hated rack press. ",6/6/2016 1:25
1941,1989, I think that's funny as well. Do you know much about elections?,12/1/1987 16:00
1941,1941," I do! I love the election season. I'm not sure of the year, but a cat named Hank placed third in the VA senate election. I would have liked to see the reaction to that!",3/15/2009 6:49
1942,1401, Me too. That would be very cool to see.,12/28/1992 14:35
1942,1942, I agree and I'm sure it was a good laugh. Did you know that all elections in Oregon are conducted by mail? I like going to the polls!,10/13/2018 0:42
1942,1942, I did not know that. I love going to the polls as well.,10/22/2017 0:58
1942,1942, I'm surprised that  the 2012 US election was the first US election since 1944 in which neither major party ticket had a veteran on it. Kinda sad if you ask me.,1/27/1976 3:51
1942,1942, Very sad. Officials in ancient Athens were appointed by lottery.,3/25/1981 12:04
1942,1401, Now that method sounds pretty scary. That's a big gamble! Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections. I'd like to see the study on the lottery for elections!,8/3/1984 15:43
1942,1942," I think so too. Since 1900, the taller candidate for the president usually wins by about 75% of the time.",5/26/2014 18:36
1942,1942," Wow. That's a big advantage. A win based on no qualifications, just a physical measure! It compares to the fact that the fastest blinker in the Presidential debates has lost every election since 1980!",4/28/1972 15:50
1942,1401, I agree. Do you know much about governors?,7/25/2017 11:17
1942,1401, I know some. I know the Governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool. Having spent a lot of time in OK I love that!,10/1/1989 19:47
1943,1156," That's pretty awesome he had a pool in the shape of the state! Well, it was great chatting with you today!",1/8/2006 1:46
1943,1156, Hi there what do you think about the Republican party? It's definitely had a long history,4/3/1976 7:20
1943,1156," It certainly has, although I would say I align myself more politically a little blue.",12/17/2008 14:34
1943,1156," ya I agree, but what is interesting to me is that we have had a democrat or a republican always elected to president since 1853",7/28/1976 7:12
1943,1943, I wonder if the two party system has always been that strong that a candidate from another party cant break through.  Like 15% of tea party supporters aligned themselves as democrats,10/6/2001 17:28
1943,1943, That is interesting. Another interesting fact is that every president with a beard has been a republican. I wonder why that is,12/17/1997 1:49
1943,1156," I dont know, I wonder how many that is, I know lincoln for sure, ",2/13/2004 18:04
1943,1156," Yep you're right. I know you said that you lean blue, I guess that red and blue has only been consistently associated with Republicans and Democrats since about the year 2000, I always thought it was a lot earlier than that",8/17/1985 16:06
1943,1943," I did too, I wonder when the Donkey and Elephant came into play, if those are more recent too or if they have a history as well.",3/29/1982 8:26
1943,1156," That's a good question. Also I heard that Harry Truman would not get his picture taken with Dumbo because he was a Democrat and obviously Dumbo is an elephant, that seems pretty dumb, would a republican not get his picture taken with Eeyore?",6/19/1991 14:19
1944,1969," Im not sure, it might be something the Simpsons would parody (and subsequently anger Fox news)  ",3/19/1998 14:56
1944,1944," What's interesting to me is that Ronald Reagan campaigned for the Democrats back in the day, he actually did not like corporate profits and low wages and was railing against them",5/16/1994 11:03
1944,1944," Wow.  I think the lines of political parties are becoming more and more defined, and more people tend to go to extremes more now than in the past.",3/8/1999 16:03
1944,1969," I agree, do you like any current celebrities? I know that Judy makes a ton of money and shes pretty famous",6/13/1986 1:27
1944,1944, I do like some of the current celebrities.  I like Judge Judy's attitude and sarcasm.  I think its crazy that she is just under LeBron for highest paid celeb.,2/18/1989 22:13
1944,1944," Yep you're right. He makes about $120,000 per episode, that's insane, do you like Robin Williams? I'm pretty sad that he's gone",7/11/2016 20:42
1944,1969," I agree, I loved his work.  He was such a pioneer in the field.  He really started the trend of actors voicing animated characters.  It is a shame that someone who lit up the world of others was struggling so much.",11/25/1982 2:20
1944,1969," Yep I agree with you. I wonder if he ever got to visit the Pixar secret room. They have a secret room just for celebrities, I hope he was able to",2/10/2013 23:43
1944,1969," I wonder what their qualifications for celebrity are, like if the person has to be current, or from the US?  ",6/4/1987 1:06
1944,1944," Yep that's a good question. for instance, there's a celebrity chef in Ethiopia. Would he be allowed to enter haha",11/23/1998 0:42
1945,1945," From what I hear he is doing work towards fighting hunger in his country.  That would qualify him in my book, although I dont even know his name.",12/30/1973 17:00
1945,1945," I agree with you there, he's trying to help his countrymen to eat foods that are more diverse so that they can combat the hunger, but again I don't know if he's gotten access to that room, maybe we should start a fundraiser for that haha",10/9/2017 17:33
1945,1945, Now I kinda want to become famous so I can go see that room.  Maybe its just a plain room with some couches and beverages that they play us so the rest of us wonder.,1/26/2007 0:03
1945,1945," Haha yep or maybe it's just an empty room lol, have you ever seen the show Sesame Street, I guess the first celebrity ever appear on there was Carol Burnett",11/4/2017 6:29
1945,1945, Hello - how are you today?,10/3/1979 7:35
1945,1556," Im great, did you watch the Black Panther movie?",1/30/1972 9:49
1945,1945, I did not. Was it any good?,2/12/2013 13:54
1945,1945," It was pretty good, you should watch it sometime, Chadwick Boseman plays the role of Black Panther",8/12/2008 13:08
1945,1556, I'll have to check it out. Do you like soundtracks?,6/28/1994 22:19
1945,1556," I do, some movies have great sound tracks, do you?",8/9/1993 0:07
1946,1946, I do as well. Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.,5/7/2002 22:28
1946,1946," Oh so that was Spielberg, nice I didnt know he was a musician as well",2/22/1993 7:19
1946,1946, I didn't know that either. O Brother Where Art Though is certified 8 times platinum.,6/6/2005 10:46
1946,1946," I didnt know that either, what movie is that the soundtrack off? do you know?",1/13/2008 11:52
1946,1946, It's called O Brother Where Art Though. It's a pretty good movie with George Clooney.,8/31/1999 1:54
1946,1946," Oh I see, did you watch the movie Tron Legacy, it also has a great soundtrack",10/22/2003 10:42
1946,1946, I did not. Was it a good movie?,9/18/1984 17:08
1946,157," It was a great movie, futuristic, theres a sequel thats also great,",11/22/2007 5:12
1946,1946, That's good. Did you know two identical twins from Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old.,3/21/2009 13:07
1946,157," I didnt, that must be a cool album wonder if theres a video, I have to watch that",4/13/1975 23:04
1947,719, You should be able to find the video online. ,4/13/2020 3:32
1947,719," Im going to search it in Youtube thats a sure thing, do you like Linkin Park?",4/10/1980 14:12
1947,1947, I love Linkin Park. What about you?,2/9/1977 17:58
1947,1947," I love the band as well, their album the Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century",6/13/2002 19:31
1947,719, It was great talking to you!,11/14/2006 6:28
1947,1947, Have you watched the movie Black Panther?,8/8/1991 12:02
1947,719," No, I haven't seen it. Have you seen it? Is it a good film?",3/29/1977 18:08
1947,719," I liked it a lot, I thought it had a great soundtrack as well. Most Marvel universe movies are pretty good",8/30/2008 18:16
1947,719, K,6/16/1980 22:06
1947,719, You know there was a time when Marvel offered the rights to their characters to Sony but they only bought the rights for Spiderman,10/21/1982 23:48
1948,1388, Sony just didn't recognize the value of so many of the characters. The Marvel Universe is huge. It's interesting that Marvel trademarked the names super-hero and super villain.,6/12/1995 18:39
1948,1948," It is interesting, you know that there is also a shared hero between the DC and Marvel universes.",10/28/1991 6:10
1948,1948," Many people have strong preferences about the two universes, but I don't. Usually I'm not big on superhero films, though I understand the attraction for comic book fans. ",3/27/1987 18:35
1948,1948," Im more of a Marvel fan myself, the brand saved a lot of money by alleging that mutants werent humans, I bet that idea made them millions.",4/11/2022 1:48
1948,1948," Speaking of aliens, Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel at one point so that he could produce a movie of himself as Spiderman.",11/1/1991 0:59
1948,1948," That would be a horror movie indeed, it would ruin the childhood of many kids lol,its a good thing Marvel wasnt sold to him.",9/24/1995 3:58
1948,1388," There have been many Spidermans, but Michael Jackson really would not be right for the role. Maybe he could have played Blue Ear, the character created for the 4-year-old boy uncomfortable with wearing hearing aids.",5/5/2001 3:19
1948,1388," I think thats really admirable, creating a superhero for a kid with dissabilities, I wonder what new projects Disney has with Marvel",2/22/1980 23:25
1948,1388," Probably a ton of sequels, maybe a new character. Black Panther could have a dozen sequels before Disney quits. Kendrick Lamar has job security.",5/6/1980 11:34
1948,1948," Yeah, Black Panther was a really popular movie and I wouldnt be suprised if more sequels were to come out, so chaging the subject a bit, what kind of music do you like, heard any good albums lately?",10/11/2002 2:05
1949,1949, I don't really listen to new music much. The industry has changed and so have tasts. I think bands have a tricky relationship with the rock press. Zeppelin did not give a name to their fourth album in order to confuse the press.,9/11/1991 6:36
1949,675," I bet that confused a lot of people lol, my favorite band is Linking Park and one of their albums is considered the best selling album of the century",6/11/1994 21:40
1949,675, I know that Linkin Park did a lot of touring. Very popular live band. They might have made more money from touring than album sales. I know that Aerosmith made more money from the game Guitar Hero than from album sales.,11/24/2009 4:22
1949,1949, That is surprising! I wonder if the game paid extremely well or the band sign really bad deals for their albums.,8/23/1999 5:48
1949,675, They probably got a good royalty from the games company. Musicians probably get better money from games. Michael Jackson contributed to the soundtrack for Sonic 3.,3/4/1992 15:30
1949,675," I wonder what his contribution was, Spielberg also contributed in the soundtrack of Jaws, he played the clarinet!!",8/3/1999 7:54
1949,675," Hi, how are you?",9/11/1991 11:02
1949,675," Hello, I am doing well thank you. How about you?",1/31/2022 21:09
1949,675, I am well. Do you like music?,8/18/2016 15:14
1949,675," Yes I do like music, I like most kinds of music. What about you?",12/30/2005 6:29
1950,1950, I like rock and jazz. I also like classical when I need to work. Did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on Jaws?,1/10/2002 0:30
1950,1950," Cool. How interesting, no I did not know that. Speaking of soundtracks, did you know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan soundtrack in 5 different languages.",3/6/1986 7:25
1950,378, Huh... Or the sound track of o brother where art thou was certified platinum 8 times over.,12/10/1974 8:27
1950,1950," Wow, I don't think that I have seen that movie in entirety. Another weird fact, Daft Punk negotiated the Tron Legacy sound track during a pancake breakfast while wearing their robot helmets.",6/5/2010 9:23
1950,378, Seems like a logical thing to do. Like naming each track on batman begins as a genus of a bat.,8/25/2003 4:22
1950,1950," Ha, interesting. What is your preferred format for music these days?",12/1/1974 20:54
1950,378," I like digital, spotify. You?",4/28/2020 15:52
1950,378," Same, here I don't recall the last time I bought a CD. I used to make mixes for the car pre MP3 jacks.",7/26/1998 23:35
1950,378, Mix tapes.... HA! Did you ever have the huge thing of CDs? LIke a case of 100 and you actually only listened to like 5?,10/13/1979 11:45
1950,378," Ha, i meant burned CD's. I think I had the adapter for CD's in my first car. Yes, like a 4 plus inch thick case full of CD's that weighed like 40 pounds.",3/6/1979 22:49
1951,1951, HA! Now we have an unlimited library on our spotify or pandora account. I remember doing some serious work on my CDs to make sure I had the right mix.,5/18/1985 22:33
1951,1269," I know right. Yes, before a trip I'd burn a new CD with all the best songs. What is your favorite CD?",8/30/1972 3:26
1951,1269, I was an early fan of Dave Matthews so I wore out Under the table and dreaming.,2/17/1979 3:52
1951,1951," I never really got into Dave Matthews. I liked the classics growing up I like Pink Floyd, probably Dark side of the Moon.",1/8/2016 20:51
1951,1951, Nice! I love Floyd. I went on a binge yesterday and listened to division bell for about 4 hours.,4/1/2001 13:36
1951,1951," Nice, even after 40 plus years Dark side of the moon is one of the best selling albums.",2/7/2011 22:51
1951,1951, I love it! Nice chatting with you!,9/4/2021 14:28
1951,1951, Do you like to read? ,10/12/1981 0:32
1951,1951," I would love to be able to read! Unfortunately, I am illiterate. I cannot read a word. What about you? Do you like to read?",7/9/1989 18:07
1951,1951," But if you are illiterate how can you read what Im writting now! just wondering lol, and yeah I do like to read, I dont always have the time though",3/22/1972 18:10
1952,1561, I guess I'm a good guesser. I don't know. I were always called slow when I were young. I look to go to the library and look at the books.,5/11/2001 11:56
1952,1561," That seems a bit messed up,well I like reading and wasnt great at it always so with enough hard work anyone can do it",11/28/1991 4:34
1952,1561," I'm giving it my all, but I just can keep up with how fast I type. I put the words on the screen, but I type too fast to read them all. If I went to prison, I would read all the time.",2/21/1992 14:45
1952,1952, I guess theres not much to do in prison so reading might be one of the few things that can keep you entertained,10/18/1985 0:49
1952,1952, I should say so? I couldn't just sit watching others read. I'd have to read myself. Did you hear about the guy that studied law in prison? That's an incentive to learn.,5/23/1982 4:29
1952,1561," I didnt, can you tell me more about him? ",7/19/1982 6:14
1952,1952, He was falsely imprisoned. He knew he has to do something. He studied law and found a way to get exonerated. He now helps others get out of prison. A hero. The man is a hero.,7/28/2008 22:40
1952,1952," I agree, he is a hero and that must have taken a lot of guts and determination, studying so hard that you can eventually set yourself free.",2/6/1984 0:23
1952,1561," I think it's inspirational. Reading can set you free. I don't believe that there are more libraries than McD's. That's not possible. Obesity is epidemic, but reading is not.",8/8/2003 16:23
1952,1561," Thats amazing, more libraries thatn McDonalds!!!  I guess there is no excuse for not picking a book up, ",5/1/1999 17:36
1953,652, What if I'm eating at the moment at McD's? I wouldn't want to get my books greasy. ,12/28/2010 15:39
1953,1953," Yeah probably not a good combianation, McDonalds and books, Norway supports writters they have a law thats really beneficial to them",3/8/1977 8:49
1953,652," That's an incentive to keep writing. Usually it's hard to be a writer, especially if you're illiterate like me. But maybe I'll move to Norway.",7/6/2014 12:38
1953,652, Yeah if you become a writter the government will buy 1000 from you and if its a childrens book they will buy 1500 ,7/19/1995 10:43
1953,652," I wonder how much money I would get from that. Is it enough to live on? How many books would I have to write every year? Do they have to be good? I have questions, and I cannot speak Norwegian or even read.",2/18/2012 14:14
1953,652," I dont know, I guess 1000 books at a right price can be enough for a few months or even years and then you can write another one and so on so it seems like a good business model",1/16/1993 4:58
1953,652, But it's cold in Norway! Maybe I could go to concerts. Do you go to concerts?,1/30/2015 7:35
1953,652," I do like attending concerts, I love music in general theres an amphitheatre in Croatia I would like to visit some time",6/19/1977 4:18
1953,1953, Did you watch the movie Black Panther?,12/28/1979 20:39
1953,652," Yes I saw, it was an OK movie. I don't remember the soundtrack even if there are famous artists on it.  ",1/23/2013 22:54
1954,1954," I thought the soundtrack was pretty good, Kendrick Lamar is a good artists and the video of the song All the Stars is good production as well.",6/22/1988 5:18
1954,1954," I don't follow him, so maybe that why it did not touch me as much, do you think the movie would have been as good if Kendrick Lamar was not involved ?",8/30/2000 11:43
1954,1954," Yeah I think the movie had a great cast, great director and follows a series of successful movies so yeah",11/1/1981 6:32
1954,1954," Soundtrack came a long way, it was not as important in the 70s, Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack, I pretty sure he is not the best clarinet player. ",5/1/1974 14:52
1954,671," I like the band Daft Punk, they were the authors of the sountrack of the movie Tron, did you watch that one?",4/17/2013 12:02
1954,1954," I have watched the 80s version, it did not featured Daft Punk, but I have heard the soundtrack of the remake, it was good. Did you like it ?",11/26/2005 17:10
1954,1954," I did like it, I thought it had a nice rhythm to it, I also liked the soundtrack of the movie Batman Begins,",6/20/1999 20:20
1954,1954," I have heard that each track was a  name of a bat family, but I still did not saw the movie, only the the 90s original, it had also a great soundtrack. ",5/10/2000 8:55
1954,1954," You should definetely watch the movie, its one of my favorites although Marvel Comics heros are pretty awesome as well.",4/24/2020 3:20
1954,1954," I saw a few films from the Marvel universe, what is your favorite Marvel movie ?",5/1/1980 4:32
1955,457," I loved the Avengers movie but also like Iron Man, he is one of my favorite heroes, what about you?",10/19/1983 12:51
1955,457," I really liked Thor : Ragnarock, it was funny. I don't like it when that take themselves to seriously, but sometimes it works like in Logan. ",11/5/2006 12:41
1955,1955, I thought it was a great movie as well and thats what I like about Marvel they mix comedy with action and great heroes.,3/7/1981 12:36
1955,1955," And to think that Sony could have bought the rights to all heroes in 98 for $25 million, they probably are still regretting that decision.  ",2/3/1971 20:56
1955,457," I bet they are as each hero is worth a lot more now, I guess they didnt have faith on the franchise.",8/13/1989 17:14
1955,1955," Yeah it was a risk, now that is not a risk anymore they are worth a lot and that why Disney paid a lot more than $25 million. ",7/1/2018 21:43
1955,457," I think that was the right call, Disney doesnt have the complete rights though, they cant show big charaters in theme parks as Universal has the rights for those",12/17/2018 21:01
1955,457," It is strange in California, it is OK, but not in Florida. But competition is always good. It will make better rides for the public. ",2/6/1996 6:39
1955,1955," I agree, although Universal Studios is falling behind, you know Marvel argued that mutants werent humans in court and received a great benefit from that.",6/15/1995 5:46
1955,457," Most of the money went to the lawyers, I guess the next superhero franchise will be Objection-Man",7/23/2022 7:53
1956,1956, It wont be long that is for sure lol,11/23/1994 19:40
1956,450, do you like comic books?,10/6/1984 16:09
1956,1956, I do . Do you know how Stan Lee ended his calls,8/21/2017 16:23
1956,450, Yes he ended them with the word exelsior,10/17/2010 10:01
1956,1956, Yeah pretty cool DO you know which universes does Marvel take place in?,10/18/2014 10:16
1956,1956, Yes that is earth 1999999,5/16/1978 6:35
1956,450, Yes. Do you know how Marvel coined the terms superhero and supervillain,8/2/2013 3:53
1956,1956, yes they just published a generic comic book with those names,2/22/1979 22:54
1956,450, Yes. Do you know what DC stands for?,6/23/2003 3:41
1956,1956," Yes it stands for Detective Comics, it is very redundant",9/30/2019 15:57
1957,1944, Yes. Do you know where is the biggest library of comic books?,4/13/2001 11:06
1957,1944, Yes that is at Michigan State University and I believe it is the biggest in the world,12/13/2003 5:31
1957,1944," Yes I was there, they have an amazing collection",1/6/2017 23:29
1957,1957, Nice. DO you know much about earth?,11/9/1995 2:05
1957,1957, I know that we have sadly destroyed more than 80% of the forests,1/12/2002 3:02
1957,1944," Yes it is so sad, In the beginning the day was only 5.5 hours long",10/22/2004 8:06
1957,1957, Yeah pretty short. Do you believe in extraterrestrials?,2/2/2000 18:32
1957,1957, I do and it is nice that we have an ambassador now in case they show up,11/15/1974 0:19
1957,1957, Yes I know. Earth will likely be helium free by the end of the century,7/23/1974 14:40
1957,1957, Yes no more fun balloons and funny voices,9/16/1988 9:08
1958,1764, Hahaa I know. SO nice chatting with you,3/15/2007 2:07
1958,1958, Same here,1/7/1981 4:31
1958,1958, Hello!,6/25/1998 19:12
1958,1958," Hi, how are you doing tonight?",1/4/2012 15:28
1958,1764, I am great! Thanks :) So do you like reading and going to the library? Half of Americans have library cards. I still go sometimes.,5/9/2016 22:19
1958,1958," I don't go to the library much. I usually do research online. Still, there are more libraries than Mcdonald's in the US.",7/11/2000 11:58
1958,1764," Yes, not a lot of people still go to the library much anymore, but I like to because they have actual books and I love books! In Sacramento you can go to one and check out sewing machines among other items, lol that is great",3/27/2018 3:34
1958,1958," Yeah, other places have a similar setup. In Berkeley they have a tool library. Some folks can't afford tools, so they can borrow. Oh my GOD, socialism! Some folks need temporary help, and I don't mind if some of my tax dollars go to something like that.",12/7/2000 2:06
1958,1764," I agree! I don't mind my tax dollars going towards helping people. I would like to write and publish a book, in Norway the government will buy 100 copies and send them to libraries throughout the country.",7/1/2018 11:43
1958,1764," The Norway gov't has a ton of money from oil. I guess I would move there and become a children's author if it weren't for the cold and snow. Still, the women are inspirational.",9/20/1994 6:34
1959,1959," Very true, it's a great idea and very valued there I am sure. ",8/23/2022 6:00
1959,108," I like that a man falsely imprisoned  spent most of his time at the library to study law and prove his innocence. Books, man, they are SO powerful. Makes me wish I could read. But I'm illiterate.",11/28/2014 15:25
1959,1959," I read about that, he was very smart to do what he did...self taught, wow and in law that must have been tough. But yes libraries are amazing, the books in print in your hand has great meaning for me, I like to collect books. You are illiterate?",7/24/2015 4:40
1959,1959, I can't read even one word! It's a miracle that I can type the words that I do. How are about you? Are you literate? Did you learn to read at the library?,3/6/2012 7:03
1959,108, I learne ,5/12/1972 3:44
1959,108," It's a noble pursuit. Learn to read, and you can teach yourself. Maybe you could even run for Congress one day.",7/29/2003 7:39
1959,1959," Sorry that last text sent on accident lol...I learned to read in school. But did go the library a lot too. I am sure a lot of people teach themselves a lot through books on their own. Run for Congress? No way lol, I wouldn't do well in Congress and politics.",10/31/1980 12:32
1959,108, You couldn't do worse than the people in there. Plus you could ride on the exclusive subway lines that they have for Congress. ,3/6/1986 21:38
1959,1959, You are right on that! I wonder if their subway plays any music at all? Have been to any concerts lately?,12/10/2007 5:06
1959,1959," Naw, concerts cost money and I'm broke, baby, I'm broke!",3/22/2021 21:16
1960,1960," That's too bad, me too! I have been to concerts throughout my life though. Seen a lot of my favorite bands. ",1/27/2015 18:22
1960,1960, Have you seen Linkin Park? I heard really good things about their concerts.,12/12/2000 3:22
1960,1960," I wish! One of the few bands I didn't get to see live, and now Chester Bennington has passed so I probably won't see the band without him. They played 324 concerts one year, that's a lot of shows.",10/19/2013 6:48
1960,1960," Ah, the energy of youth! Maybe they didn't sleep? I don't know how they did that.",10/29/1984 5:05
1960,1960," Well, the Ramones played 2,263 concerts over a 20 year span, non stop. I think they just make it their life. It has been great chatting! Have a great evening!!",6/12/2001 7:52
1960,873, The Ramones are fueled by drugs and passion. I could never manage to sustain that kind of energy. They are not human. ,6/5/2002 10:44
1960,873," You have a point there, I know I couldn't do it! ",10/24/1995 3:11
1960,1960," Hello, how are you?",3/7/1970 6:40
1960,873, hello! I'm good! How are you? Do you like comics?,10/27/2019 13:03
1960,873," Yeah, to some degree. I don't read many though.",2/11/1974 11:12
1961,1961, I don't read many either but I do like Marvel.  Have you ever heard of Lady Killer?,2/15/2017 1:19
1961,1239," Honestly, no I haven't. I've read more on the DC side of things",10/4/1981 9:21
1961,1961, Really?  I heard recently that back in 1938 DC paid $130 dollars for the exclusive rights to superman.,9/30/1978 10:39
1961,1239," Yeah, they've got their money's worth, that's for sure. ",7/12/2005 1:37
1961,1239, They definitely did!  I guess comics really got popular in the 1930s.  ,3/15/2005 1:35
1961,1961," I would say a bit later, but they do call it the golden age for a reason. ",12/28/1980 6:19
1961,1239, I guess they do at that!  Did you know that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel so he could play spiderman in a movie?,5/24/2003 10:29
1961,1961," I've heard rumors of it, but never if it was true or not. I do feel bad for him, he never really was a child.",12/2/1990 17:47
1961,1239, I know.  With his popularity back then Marvel should have financed a movie with him in it. It probably would have been a blockbuster.,12/26/2009 10:19
1961,1961," It would have been interesting, to say the least. I can see why they didn't want to risk Spiderman though, make him into a joke.",2/17/1990 22:57
1962,1138, I suppose.  Are you interested in outerspace?,7/14/1979 4:56
1962,1962," Yeah, I love space and science stuff. Big nerd. :)",4/10/1981 0:18
1962,1962, What do you think about Jupiter saving us from asteroids?,4/2/2001 4:42
1962,1962," I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be at least partly true. It's a big gravity well, protects us. As does the moon",9/21/1979 10:50
1962,1138," I can see how it would stop some asteroids.  You know, on the subject of gravity, the hudson bay region in canada has less gravity than anywhere else on the planet.",9/12/1981 3:33
1962,1138," Interesting, I wonder if its due to the density of rock below the bay or if there's something else going on",4/26/2015 9:24
1962,1962, I don't know. Would rock density make a difference in some way?,10/16/1996 5:50
1962,1962," Yeah, a great deal. Mass and gravity are intertwined. ",9/7/2017 4:33
1962,1138, I see.  That's interesting to think about.,3/30/2010 4:38
1962,1138," Hi, do you go to the library often?",7/11/2002 6:40
1963,1963, Funny i'm in one right now. lol!,9/6/1982 23:44

1963,975, I agree. There's a library that offers sewing machine check out!,2/13/1972 16:23
1963,1963," Wow that sounds pretty cool, better not drop it or you bought it though!.",11/13/1982 15:35
1963,1963, HA! THere's also a library that loans out tools. Thats neat too.,7/31/2014 0:30
1963,1963, Yeah i think that's a great ideal. Did you know the library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet. ,10/8/2014 9:15
1963,975," Good, I really want them to keep a copy of this chat. I feel like great things are ahead!",7/16/2004 2:17
1963,975," Awe, lol! Hey if you publish a book in Norway the government will buy 1000 copies 1500 if it's a children's book.",7/20/1994 8:17
1963,1963, We should publish this as a book and get some money from Norway. See the chat is getting monetary now!,11/21/1987 12:06
1964,1964, That's what's up!! Why is Elmo testifying before the us congress? I know it sounds like the beginning of a joke but seriously. ,12/26/2000 8:16
1964,1964, Because Big Bird couldn't get throught the metal detector. She had bird flu.,7/24/1995 16:14
1964,1143, Stop it!! Have you ever heard of Fantasy congress before? Apparently it's just like fantasy football.,7/20/1975 17:21
1964,1964, I have not but I think that would be a good way to introduce civics in HS. everyone knows fantasy now-a-days.,6/8/2022 3:39
1964,1964, Right!! There has been a Dem vs. /rep baseball game since 1909 and the Rep are winning by 3.,8/23/2010 23:09
1964,1964, Do they let women play on the teams? The first one was in congress in 1916 and couldn't even vote!,7/4/2020 7:47
1964,1964, That sounds like a slap in the face to me. Just her an Elmo hanging out with the gavel. ,4/19/1999 13:12
1964,1964," If it was post-nixon, you mean gavelS....",10/9/2010 22:35
1964,1143," Right Tricky Dicks got a temper, always breaking stuff. Man Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001.",3/14/1998 22:21
1964,1964, That's a lot of shows! Nice chatting with you!,8/2/1973 15:02

1965,829," Yea, on the Jaws soundtrack Spielberg played the clarinet",1/7/1988 14:52
1965,1965, So his not only the director of the movie but was also one of the musicians? thats awesome,5/23/2021 12:53
1965,829," Did you ever listen to the O Brother, Where art thou? soundtrack, it is certified 8 times platinum ",5/1/2002 0:19
1965,1965," No not really Im not familired with that soundtrack I am with the one of the movie Tron Legacy, ",9/11/2001 9:27
1965,829, Wasn't Daft Punk involved with the Tron Legacy soundtrack?,12/13/1981 20:17
1965,1965," Yeah they netgotiated the terms of the soundtrack over pancakes, they even wore their robot helmets, hell of a breakfast",4/29/2013 19:07
1965,1965," Interesting. I never knew Phil Collins worked on the Tarzan soundtrack, wasn't much of a good movie",8/21/1985 20:53
1965,829," I heard he recorded the sountack in 5 different languages, talented guy",2/7/1979 11:27
1965,1965," The batman begins soundtrack was pretty good, I never knew the track titles were names of bat genuses",11/15/1983 14:36
1966,1666," I loved that soundtrack, really inspiring actually, Batman Begins is one of my favorite movies",12/8/2005 3:11
1966,1966, Yea the Batman and Marvel movies are really good. It's crazy Sony rejected Marvel's offer to buy all it's characters for $25 million,2/17/1996 6:09
1966,1666," Sony must be regretting that decision each hero is worh like 20 times that amount know, that was a great bargain",5/27/2019 15:19
1966,1966," Yea, I bet Sony is kicking itself for only pay 10 million for Spiderman back in 1998",5/6/1980 11:23
1966,1666, Did you like the Sony Spiderman movies? ,9/18/1977 23:52
1966,1966, I liked the first two with Tobey McGuire,5/21/2016 16:11
1966,1666," I liked them as well but I have to say im digging the new version more, Im exited to watch the Spiderman movie after Infinity War",6/15/1984 8:08
1966,1966," Yea I hope it's good, maybe the hero owned by both Marvel and DC   called Access will make a cameo",1/8/1978 18:24
1966,1966," There is also a hero called Blue Ear, have you heard of him?",12/1/2008 22:22
1966,1666, Isn't Blue Ear the hero with hearing aids?,1/27/1991 5:33

1969,1969, ya its crazy that it takes up about 33% of all internet traffic,2/5/2012 22:46
1969,1969, That is crazy. Did you know Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth? ,8/1/2016 14:49
1969,162," no that is wild, I see why they want to switch to all digital, also crazy that netflix and youtube together make up half of all internet traffic, I watch youtube all the time",4/10/1981 3:11
1969,162, That is also crazy. I didn't realize Reed Hastings was inspired to startup Netflix after racking up $40 in late fees on Apollo 13.,11/4/1987 16:05
1970,1970," haha ya that is a wild thing, good movie though, sad that blockbuster didn't buy them when they had the chance",2/8/1976 5:29
1970,518, I agree. Crazy that Netflix is now worth $2 billion.,2/7/1988 14:35

1970,1970," ya I don't know, I just know he was knighted for services to literature so hopefully they are really good",6/24/1999 20:31
1970,518, Interesting. Did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between reality and fantasy? ,3/3/2004 15:51
1971,1754," I didn't, would you ever check out that fantasy novel from that janitor in chicago, I guess it was like 15k pages haha",7/16/2000 7:29

1971,1754, Yeah pretty crazy. Do you know who invented it?,3/18/2007 8:43
1971,1754, A guy who got tired of paying late fees on VHSs and decided to start something new,2/9/1983 10:36
1971,1754, Yeah Did you ever use Blckbuster?,10/25/2014 20:16
1972,1675, I sued to before. Too bad they passed on buying netflix when they could,9/23/1986 14:39
1972,1972," Exactly, could have spent $50 million and make billions now",7/13/1980 9:54
1972,1972," Not a very smart business decisoon, bet they are kicking themselves about it",7/30/2012 19:56
1972,1675, Yup. WIth youtube they make half of the peak internet usage in NA,1/14/1977 8:14

1972,1675," Yeah they are pretty cool. Their bricks are really consistent it seems , only 18 out of 1 million are defective",7/21/1972 1:39
1972,1675, that makes for great quality and in turn for awesome business,1/19/2016 18:51
1972,1972, pretty much. If all lego bricks available were shared among people everyone would get 86,11/3/2014 6:03
1973,1288, Nice. A german artist once painted a bridge to make it look like it was made of lego,11/30/2003 11:27
1973,1973, Neat. If workers word at their company for 25 years they would get a 14 karat gold lego,4/2/2008 12:01
1973,1973," yeah and it was worth a lot, $15 000",12/20/2021 12:55

1973,1288," I liked the Marvel shows, like luke cage, but they canceled those. You?",8/4/1987 2:47
1973,1288," I have been watching the Marvel movies recently,  theres a lot on Netfllix right now.  I never watched luke cage though,  any good?  I watched jessica jones,  but didnt really like it too much.  I am currently watching the flash and catching up on the walking dead. ",9/8/1992 20:29
1974,227, It was pretty good. They recently canceled those shows so I have lost all motivation to watch them. I do watch the flash though. I really like it. Do you also watch the arrow?,10/2/1989 6:28
1974,1974," i watched like 2 seasons of the arrow,  but I dont like it much,  hes too dark,  he can never be happy.  I only kept watching is cuz felicity smoak is awesome!",5/25/2016 3:56
1974,1974, Yeah I like her. Last season got of the rails a little and I completely understand your dark comment. It can get really dark. I find it entertaining though. What else do you watch?,6/30/1989 11:48
1974,1974," I watch a lot of comedy stuff,  How i met your mother,  friends,  the good place,  the santa clarita diet, stuff like that,  easy stuff.  I do like a lot of drama though,  like westworld,  the handmaids tale etc. ",4/16/1998 23:07
1974,227, Nice. How I met your mother was underrated. I really like westworld but I can get confused watching it. I watch a lot of live sports too.,5/25/1975 3:53
1974,227," Oh ok thats cool.  Yes,  westworld is confusing.    I really like some of the netflix originals too,  like black mirror and maniac.  have you watched those?",9/14/2002 3:08
1974,227, I tried watching black mirror but it was a little too weird for me. Never saw maniac. What's it about?,1/15/1977 16:16
1974,1974, Maniac is confusing too lol I am not sure right now cuz I havent finished it.  Black mirror is really creepy but I find it entertaining because it has all to do with the bad places technology can take us.  Its trippy. ,2/17/1987 23:49
1974,227, That stuff is pretty scary. Kinda makes me want to shut down my digital life and write letters again.,4/9/1996 7:56
1974,227," Yeah seriously,  but at the same time the show is enlightening,  kinda showing us what we dont want to happen with our future in techonology. ",1/27/1996 14:50
1975,142, It doesn't help that companies continuously sell or lose our data...,8/26/2000 23:48
1975,1975," yeah thats definitely upsetting,  they want us to always give info for security reasons then they get hacked or whatever,  ",8/29/2018 15:07
1975,1975," Someone once told me if you did not buy a product, you are the product. I scoffed at them but now it makes so much sense.",10/31/2009 9:43
1975,1975, what do you mean?  ,8/3/2008 13:51
1975,1975," When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.",3/20/1989 7:34
1975,1975," Oh I get it,  wow thats scary lol ",10/2/1996 5:12
1975,142, Yeah... Nice chatting with you!,10/2/1978 8:13
1975,1975," Hello,  have you watched black panther?",12/1/1980 8:16
1975,142," i have not seen it yet, but i hear good things about it. you?",6/19/1992 8:55
1975,1975," Yes,  it is a great movie.  Not really funny like the other marvel movies still good though.  Black panther is actually the richest super hero. ",8/3/2008 10:32
1976,1976, will he ever become prsident and be the richest president in history? maybe he should. when was the character created?,4/14/1973 21:20
1976,1518," Why should he do that,  he owns a country and hes a super hero, no time to be president lol ",3/13/2001 17:44
1976,1518," well, he should at least test the waters. he has the cash to buy the whole congress.",12/23/2020 10:59
1976,1976," Seems like more stress to me.  If you are already rich,  why not just enjoy life and vacation,  see the world,  live stress free!  ",7/10/2020 15:50
1976,1976," yes, i guess he could kick back, but the world is in trouble and we need his help. Superheroes have no choice. they must help",8/2/1983 6:31
1976,1518, True.  Are you a fan of the Marvel comics/movies?  ,9/12/2017 13:08

1976,1976," Nice,  I really like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor.  ",5/23/1974 12:06
1976,1518," I havent seen GotG. it is kinda a comedy, right? sort of tongue in cheek?",12/17/2019 9:57
1976,1976," Yeah,  really funny and a lot of action.  ",6/10/1979 16:06
1977,1977," Hey, kids, get a load of the campy vomit scene? Right? Right? Ha ha! Oh, boy, that is a great exorcism!",10/17/1998 11:26
1977,1820, lol yeah,8/24/2008 17:32
1977,1820," So, what do we have here, albums and Drake. Albums? Drake? Albums. What is your favorite album?",7/7/1976 9:47
1977,1977, I think my favorite album is Bryce Vine.  How about yourself?,2/5/1983 12:18
1977,1820, I have been listening to Bill Evans a lot recently. He was a jazz pianist.,5/31/2016 11:09
1977,1820, Ah interesting.  I think thats my favorite instument.  The piano. ,7/10/2010 15:04
1977,1820," Yes, give him a listen. Waltz for Debby. Start with that album. Anyway, great chat!",9/10/1986 3:27
1977,1820," Its been a good chat,  thanks! ",8/10/2018 22:30
1977,1820, hey did you know the richest superhero is black panther?,12/5/1975 7:38
1977,1977, I did not. I found the article on Paul Rand humourous!,2/22/2015 21:24
1978,1978, don't think Ive seen that article what does it say?,12/12/1985 12:00
1978,1978," On Saturday, Ryan tweeted and then deleted this: A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week ... she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year. The responses were not kind... Twitter is the best and worst!",2/26/1976 8:44
1978,1978," lol ya that is not a lot of money, oooof what a disaster haha",5/21/1987 23:33
1978,1978," I know. Here's a response: If she's 30 and saved that 1.50 until she's 65, thats $2,750. Totally makes up for losing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which is how they are planning to repay the 1.5 Trillion they added to the deficit",2/15/2022 20:48
1978,1978," haha ya politics is a joke, I try not to read the news because i'ts too depressing, other thing I can't believe is that linkin park's hybrid theory is the best selling record of the 21st century, that is also scary to me",4/7/1972 8:02
1978,1254, Really!? I love that album. Like the one with Jay Z too.,7/3/2019 2:04
1978,1978," oh really, ya I just don't like lincoln park, thats just me though I'm more into classic rock and 80's music",5/20/2009 0:55
1978,1978, What is your band? I listen to classic rock a lot at the gym.,2/26/2011 5:45
1978,1978," ah I mean I like metallica and guns and roses a lot, but ive heard them so many times I've been diving into lesser known 80s bands recently",2/11/2021 23:32
1978,1254, Do you consider Metallica and G&R classic rock? What 80s bands?,5/26/2001 15:29
1979,1979," I do, you could say metallica is more metal but they got to be more rock-like in the 90's, I like thompson twins hold me now, I've been listening to that a lot recently",6/2/2001 23:08
1979,1979, That's interesting... I am 40 and think of Led Zepplin when I think classic rock. Is this an age thing?,9/6/1973 12:46
1979,1979," ah it might be haha, or maybe i'm just wrong, I do love led zepplin though, pink floyd is also amazing",7/19/1978 10:22
1979,921," Pink floyd is my favorite band, or should I say the one I consistently listen to and do not get bored with. I can listen to them all the time whereas other bands I turn off after a while...",5/28/2005 0:42
1979,1979," oh wow interesting, ya I got into them and I think their animals album is super underrated, like you don't heard songs from that album on the radio at all",2/4/2001 21:36
1979,1979," No, that's one of their sneaky albums. Dark side of the moon is the commercial hit but the others are just as good.",11/8/2008 4:24
1979,1979," yup dark side and the wall are the ones that everyone knows, but they're so overplayed that I got into their other stuff which you're right is just as good if not better",11/30/1977 1:21
1979,1979, It makes me sad that artists like them wouldn't be successful in today's market.,6/27/2001 22:44
1979,921, nope people don't like that kind of music unfortunately these days,12/1/2003 8:06
1979,921, Nice chatting with you.,5/21/1976 13:02
1980,573, Hello! How are you tonight?,6/17/2022 11:59
1980,1980," Hi there, I am well thank you.  Are you interested in astronomy?",7/3/1994 14:22
1980,1980, I am! I think the whole universe is such a marvelous thing! how about you?,3/22/2012 3:47
1980,573," Yeah same here, I think it is all pretty amazing.  ",11/2/2007 17:35
1980,1980, I would never want to be on that planet that has shards of glass traveling sideways at 4500 mph!,9/21/1978 13:17
1980,573," Holy cow, I wonder how they found that and then determined that is what happens there. ",8/10/1991 10:47
1980,573, I was thinking the same thing. So crazy to believe there are that many planets out there! Even our planet is crazy!,9/16/2002 19:18
1980,1980, Yeah it's crazy to think what is actually out there.  Even moons of planets can be pretty crazy. ,11/18/2019 16:27
1980,1980," I agree! Did you know if earth's history was view as a 24 hour period, humans would only take up 1 minutes and 17 seconds of it?",1/9/1996 20:52
1980,573, That makes you think how small we are in the grand scheme of time.  ,6/13/1998 7:13
1981,1981," And in that time, we've managed to destroy 80 percent of the natural forests. So sad!",10/16/1995 19:42
1981,1981," That is super sad, and that's not something that you can just fix very quickly as well. ",5/8/1999 13:24
1981,558, I'm sure we'll always have a problem with trees. I know we are going to be helium free by the end of the 21st century so that is sad as well!,11/12/1976 10:48
1981,558," That is wild to think, I wonder what the balloon companies will do to survive?",6/14/1991 18:58
1981,558," I wonder that all the town, and clowns haha. I guess I could do without them lol.",4/16/2020 8:50
1981,558," Lol, did you know that when the earth was first formed the days were only 5.5 hours long?",3/6/1988 11:30
1981,1981, Oh really? That is nuts! I don't think I would ever get a good sleep back in the day! I wonder how it got to be 24 hours and stay like it?,6/15/2006 6:23
1981,1981," Well i don't think it's staying like it, but maybe i'm wrong, I think in another couple hundred thousand years the days will be a bit longer. ",7/5/1976 14:27
1981,558, I think you're onto something! I wonder if I will ever be the UN ambassador to aliens?,10/7/2009 6:59
1981,1981," Lol, I wonder how much that job pays, that sounds like a pretty sweet gig to me. ",3/28/1971 3:12
1982,1982," I think I'll look into it. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night!",12/1/2010 0:09
1982,1982," Hi, how are you?",10/27/1977 15:40
1982,1982, I'm good. Do you remember listening to albums?,11/28/2000 8:03
1982,1982," Like a music CD? I love them, I especially love Linkin Park",12/24/1984 10:09
1982,774, I like Linkin Park okay. It's not my favorite. My spouse likes them and Staind.,11/3/2019 6:33
1982,774," I love Linkin Park, and they sold some really profitable albums too!",10/31/2018 6:46
1982,774," They must be popular, because I still see them on tour. I can't believe all the old bands that are still around and touring. ",11/9/1977 3:23
1982,774," Unfortunately the singer killed himself a year or two ago, so now it is just Mike Shinoda",8/18/2010 16:03
1982,1982, I think I remember my spouse saying something about that. I think more needs to be done about suicide awareness. ,10/7/1999 0:21
1982,1982," I agree, it is a shame people still think it is people being dramatic",5/22/2005 0:55
1983,1983," I don't think it is people being dramatic. Maybe there are a few who like to get attention that way, but I think they still have a mental health problem if they repeatedly say they are going to kill themselves. I know it used to be an expression to say, I could just die. ",3/11/1998 9:13
1983,1983," Yeah I agree, it is unfortunate, and Linkin Park helped a lot of people through that too, so it is a shame he had bad issues",3/7/1993 15:53
1983,450," Yes, I think that and the death of other famous people, like Robin Williams. A friend's husband committed suicide last year. It has been very hard on her family.",3/19/2004 12:54
1983,1983," I can only imagine, such a sad thing. ",11/28/2012 13:24
1983,1983," Yes, she really struggles coming to terms with the situation. She posts about it a lot on social media. Who can blame her. She probably asks herself why this happened every single day. ",10/24/2003 12:20
1983,450," It is truly sad. On another note, have you seen Black Panther?",1/24/1991 16:23
1983,450," No, I haven't seen that movie. I'm surprised, because my spouse likes to watch the Marvel movies. I think he was turned off by the last Avengers movie, though.",2/28/1976 12:04
1983,1983," I was as well, it did not impress me at all. Black Panther did very well at the box office, over a billion at least",4/1/2003 23:51
1983,450, Wow! I may have to mention it to my spouse and see if he wants to watch it. He will be impressed since I am always wanting to watch girlie movies according to him. ,9/16/2008 3:38
1983,1983," Haha, that is the trade off, but Black Panther was very good, the character in the movie is said to be worth 500 billion dollars",4/8/1992 19:10
1984,770, That is a big difference from Tony Stark who is only worth $100 billion! ,6/5/1976 0:04
1984,1984," That is for sure, or even bruce wayne, who is at 80 billion",4/17/1993 3:05
1984,1984, Did you hear that a Super Earth may have been discovered? ,2/9/1976 14:51
1984,1984," Hi! Yes, I heard! It's mind blowing and extremely excited. I heard its unlike anything in our solar system!",10/23/2017 18:11
1984,770," Crazy, I wonder if it has aliens? ",8/2/1992 15:21
1984,770," Hmmm, I don't know, but I wonder too! I feel like there very well be something living there. Researchers say its larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune and far enough from the din. red sun and any water on its surface is locked away by ice... sounds like a Cold Planet...NO THANKS! Id consider Mars... haha",1/28/2009 5:45
1984,770, Well apparently it is near Proxima Centauri.,9/9/1996 12:14
1984,1984," AND only 6 light years away from the sun...fun fact, this new Earth is TWICE as OLD as the sun! mind blown!",5/15/1972 4:02
1984,1984, Wow! Apparently Peter Kamp thought years ago that star could host a planet. ,12/17/1975 9:28
1984,770, They have been studying this since the 70's... Why are we hearing about this now?! These are exciting news! ,6/2/2017 7:53
1985,1217, Interesting. I'm not sure. Did you know the planet Venus does not tilt? ,1/12/1977 7:03
1985,1985," Interesting fact. I was not aware but I did learn that in 1975 the soviet union successfully sent a spacecraft to venus, which captures first images from the surface of ANOTHER planet! imagine THAT selfie!",7/16/2003 0:27
1985,1985, Hilarious. Well apparently when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. ,7/2/1991 4:58
1985,1217," and we think there isn't enough time in a day now, Wow. I wonder if we already called Earth Gaia at that time, or Tellus or telluris which is one of many Earth's names... um who came up with these names?! I am doing some research after this! fascinating.",12/3/2021 11:54
1985,1985, I'm not sure. But Earth's interior core remains active with solid iron. ,4/30/2017 20:32
1985,1217, Solid Iron eh? well I'm glad! and Thank You Jupiter for saving Earth from many asteroids that head our way. Would you ever consider leaving the planet? There is an open space in Mars one apparently.,5/31/1994 12:52
1985,1217," Yeah, apparently the solid iron is surrounded by a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magenetic field. ",4/25/2006 10:32
1985,1217," interesting, I imaginen it changes direction when Earth does? because it happens every 200,000-300,000 years.  Did you know that if you fit all the planets in between earth an the moon and still have room  left over to spare?",9/30/1980 13:26
1985,1217," No, I didn't know that. Apparently the UN appointed an ambassador to aliens though, pretty wild stuff!",5/22/1976 10:36
1985,1217," I knew it! haha, Im sure they know more than they lead on, I would LOVE to know though! i know most of the time is to avoid panic but wish i was in on the secrets imagine all the cool stuff they must find out about!",5/2/2012 5:35
1986,1986," Yeah, it reminds me of that movie Independence Day. Hilarious!",1/23/1980 23:51
1986,354," yes, and it talks about it in a really good book its over 100 years old the book is called Barron Trump, the marvelous underground adventures something like that. It talks about our days today...pretty creepy right on. Did you know The term Robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction in 1941 by author issac asimov",12/19/2015 10:44
1986,354, Interesting. There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters as well. Nice meeting you!,10/30/1971 12:04
1986,354, Have you heard about the Super Earth?,6/30/1985 17:11
1986,354, Is that evidence of an alien world?,6/23/1990 20:06
1986,354," I think it is a possibility...It a planet with the same distance and conditiions from its sun but it is frozen,",6/18/2009 17:25
1986,1986, Did you know that the planet Venus does not tilt?,4/4/2022 9:30
1986,1986, I wonder if it is so close to the sun?,2/17/1989 4:11
1986,1986, That could be so.,4/25/1999 2:52
1986,354, It also rotates counter clock wise!,7/18/1998 18:11
1987,685, Is that true?,4/17/1970 7:34
1987,1987," Yep, and it has not seasons either.  Just hot Im sure lol.",6/21/1997 17:33
1987,1987, Either that or it is really cold!,3/30/2004 12:47
1987,685, Nah it is super hot as the it is closer to the sun.  Earth is the 3rd planet from the sun,10/16/2007 14:27
1987,1987, Earth is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life as well.,7/28/2016 21:57
1987,685, That we know of...need water for life and Earth has 71 percent covered.,4/15/1990 18:04
1987,1987," Yes, mostly by oceans.",4/22/2003 0:16
1987,685, And our polar regions.,3/20/1984 3:51
1987,685, It's sad to think that more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.,6/1/1995 17:52
1987,1987," Yeah, we keep growing...we will need to find another planet to live on one day!",11/22/1991 1:03
1988,1922, No kidding.,7/11/2016 8:10
1988,1922, It will have to have a satellite or moon along with oceans,12/31/1995 3:29
1988,1922, Most certainly.,7/7/1995 19:29
1988,1922, Interesting talking to you take care!,9/5/1997 23:48
1988,1988," Yes, you too!",8/25/1986 14:31
1988,1922, See you on another planet possibly haha.,12/15/2021 10:49
1988,1988," Hi, how are you? Do you like music?",3/17/1992 23:46
1988,1988, I love music. I'm a professional guitarist. Though I'm nowhere close to being Brian May! Did you know he's also a physicist??,12/13/1978 19:13
1988,1922, He started studying physics then joined a band. Bright guy. Youre a professional guitarist? Thats great! ,12/30/2021 1:42
1988,1922, Thanks! What type of music do you like? Any angsty Broadway musical numbers like Eddie Perfect wrote for Beetlejuice?,11/10/2015 18:08
1989,1989, Eddie Perfect? Who is that? I have seen the movie Beetlejuice.,10/26/2014 22:30
1989,821, He was an Australian composer who ended up writing the music for the Broadway adaptation of the movie. Really interesting story there.,2/24/2022 21:42
1989,1989, I did not know that. I guess he must have done other stuff as well. ,11/20/1979 12:20
1989,1989, Oh yeah. He also wrote songs for King Kong the musical! Can you imagine how weird that show must have been ha ha?,10/5/2012 13:50
1989,1989, That sounds strange for a musical.  Do you like jazz much?,7/1/2015 3:02
1989,1989, Jazz is my soul. I prefer bebop the most. I never really liked the cool jazz that came out in the 40s much. How about you?,12/19/1970 2:35
1989,821," I like Sonny Rollins and Bill Evans. By the way, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including Million dollar baby",10/29/1989 17:50
1989,1989," You're right, he is! Crazy to think of a gruff Clint Eastwood sitting at a piano writing soft melodies ha ha. ",7/20/1987 17:54
1989,1989, Jazz is in the oddest places too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.,7/18/1979 12:57
1989,821, It's crazy how culture spreads like that. I mean look at comedy. It goes all the way back to ancient Greece! ,12/25/1985 8:53
1990,1990, Comedy is fundamental to human existence. Did you know that jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing? I thought it was a fashion.,8/13/1973 6:26
1990,1233, I've heard about that somewhere. It does make them look cool though. But what's cooler is that there's a whole programming language written in music. Crazy!,5/25/1996 20:07
1990,1233, I wonder who uses that language. You know what else is crazy: A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years! ,9/25/1977 5:48
1990,1990," Yeah, she's awesome! I wonder if she ever went to see Beetlejuice. Apparently Eddie Perfect's music was a perfect fit for it. Excuse the bad pun ha ha.",3/21/1978 1:40
1990,1990," I wonder too. Anyway, great chat, cat!",4/12/1995 9:58
1990,1233, You too brother. Keep on rocking in the free world. Peace!,3/29/1979 2:52
1990,1990, Rock it dawg,10/16/2011 9:10
1990,1233, Set the world ablaze like Eddie Van Halen did to his speakers. Adios.,10/26/2019 1:55
1990,1990, did you know Van Halen set speakers on fire with his playing! That is so metal,7/18/2004 23:35
1990,1990, I had never heard that!  There are some crazy rockers out there - Queen's guitarist has a phd in astrophysics,2/1/1994 22:02
1991,1991," that is cool, I think he also uses coins as guitar picks, he's super talented!",2/4/1996 0:55
1991,98, Yeah those guys are nuts.  A member of Pink Floyd uses a houseboat on the Thames as a recording studio,1/27/1974 17:57
1991,98," that is cool, do you like PInk Floyd? I like them a lot I still listen to all their music",9/7/2006 13:53
1991,1991, I do not.  I like jazz more - just like Clint Eastwood,2/22/1992 12:17
1991,1991," ya I never got into Jazz, what are some albums I should listen to? I do like Clint Eastwood though",11/16/1985 14:11
1991,1991, I like the blues and ragtime styles best the most - anything from New Orleans is great!,12/20/2006 11:44
1991,98," ok I'll check it out, have you heard Pakistan has jazz music?",4/26/1970 5:19
1991,98, I did not know that.  Kansas City does too!,8/3/1999 23:55
